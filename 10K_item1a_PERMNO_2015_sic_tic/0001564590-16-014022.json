{"cik": "1501756", "company": "Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if achieved, be able to sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since we were founded in 2006 and expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue development of our product candidates. Our net loss for 2015 and 2014 was $47.5 million and $25.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $84.2 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials, research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, clinical testing, regulatory compliance activities and, if any of our product candidates is approved, sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in us incurring significant losses for the next several years.\nWe have announced entry into the Acquisition Agreement with Annapurna. If the transaction with Annapurna (the Transaction) is successfully completed, we intend to continue Annapurna\u2019s research and development activities, which will likely result in us incurring additional losses.\nWe currently generate no revenue from sales, and we may never be able to commercialize AVA-101 or any of our other product candidates. We do not currently have the required approvals to market AVA-101 or any of our other product candidates, and we may never receive such approvals or, if the Transaction is completely successfully, approvals to market any product candidates of Annapurna. We may not be profitable even if we or any of our future development partners succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing our product candidates, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe will require substantial future capital in order to complete the preclinical and clinical development for our product candidates and to potentially commercialize these product candidates. Any future clinical trials of our product candidates would cause an increase in our spending levels, as would other corporate activities. The amount and timing of any expenditure needed to implement our development and commercialization programs will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe type, number, scope, progress, expansion costs, results of and timing of any future clinical trials of any of our product candidates which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;\n\u00b7\nthe need for, and the progress, costs and results of, any additional clinical trials of our product candidates we may initiate based on the results of any clinical trials that we may plan or discussions with the FDA, including any additional trials the FDA or other regulatory agencies may require evaluating the safety of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of obtaining or maintaining manufacturing for our product candidates, including commercial manufacturing if any product candidate is approved;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of establishing sales and marketing capabilities and enhanced internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nthe terms and timing of establishing collaborations, license agreements and other partnerships;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with product candidates of Annapurna if the Transaction is completed successfully;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with any new product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain partnering arrangements for development; and\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with being a public company.\nSome of these factors are outside of our control. We do not expect our existing capital resources to be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of our clinical trials and remaining development program through commercial introduction. We expect that we will need to raise additional funds in the future.\nWe have not sold any products, and we do not expect to sell or derive revenue from any product sales for the foreseeable future. We may seek additional funding through collaboration agreements and public or private financings. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and given our decision not to move forward with a Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015, our ability to obtain funding in the future on favorable terms, or at all, may be substantially impaired. If the Transaction is not successfully completed, our ability to obtain future funding may be further impaired. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. In addition, the issuance of additional shares by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we will be unable to complete any future clinical trials for our product candidates and we may be required to significantly curtail some or all of our activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates or some of our technologies or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nRisks Related to the Discovery and Development of Our Product Candidates\nOur business to date has depended substantially on the success of AVA-101. In the third quarter of 2015, we determined not to move forward with a Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. If we ultimately discontinue development of AVA-101, commercialization of our first product candidate may be delayed, and our business may be materially harmed.\nWe currently have only one product candidate that has been the focus of advanced development efforts: AVA-101, a recombinant adeno-associated vector type 2 (AAV2) encoding the anti-VEGF protein sFlt-1. To date, we have considered successful continued development and ultimate regulatory approval of AVA-101 critical for our future business success.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, following analysis of the data generated in our Phase 2a clinical study of AVA-101, we concluded that, overall, we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase 2a study. We decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. We are instead conducting additional preclinical studies to inform further development of our wet AMD program, which has included studies to evaluate and optimize protein expression to compare variables impacting total anti-VEGF effect such as volume, concentration, and equipment for and location of injections, as well as different routes and potential methods of administration for AVA-101 and AVA-201. We cannot predict the outcome of these preclinical studies or whether we will ultimately decide to resume clinical development of AVA-101.\nOur other product candidates are in the early stage of development and will require additional preclinical studies, substantial clinical development and testing, manufacturing bridging studies and process validation and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. If we decide to discontinue development of AVA-101 and focus on our other product candidates, commercialization of our first product candidate may be delayed, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nEven if we decide to resume clinical development of AVA-101 as part of our wet AMD program, such continued development would require additional clinical studies that, in conjunction with the additional preclinical studies relating to our wet AMD program that we are undertaking, could result in a significant development delay. If development of AVA-101 is delayed, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe are conducting additional preclinical studies to further inform development of our wet AMD program, which has included studies to evaluate and optimize protein expression, to compare variables impacting total anti-VEGF effect such as volume, concentration, and equipment for and location of injections, as well as different routes and potential methods of administration for AVA-101 and AVA-201. As part of our preclinical re-evaluation of our wet AMD program, direct comparisons of AVA-101 and -201 are being carried out. If we decide to resume clinical development of AVA-101, we may be required to conduct additional Phase 1 or Phase 2a clinical trials to demonstrate safety and tolerability of AVA-101. These additional studies could result in a significant development delay. If development of AVA-101 is delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of AVA-101 could be significantly reduced.\nContinued development and potential commercialization of AVA-101 would require additional investment of a significant portion of our time and financial resources. If we decide to continue development and potential commercialization of AVA-101 and are unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, AVA-101, our business may be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of AVA-101. We believe that continued development of AVA-101, in particular development at a different dosage and/or with a different administration procedure than was studied in the Phase 2a study, will require additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, including potential additional Phase 1 or Phase 2a clinical trials to demonstrate safety and tolerability of AVA-101 as administered in dose studies. This in turn will require further investment of a significant portion of our time and financial resources. The future regulatory and commercial success of this product candidate is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may not have sufficient financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials for AVA-101;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to provide evidence of efficacy and safety for AVA-101;\n\u00b7\nwe do not know the degree to which AVA-101 will be accepted as a therapy for wet AMD, even if approved;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory bodies for marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nsubjects in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to AVA-101;\n\u00b7\nif approved for treatment of wet AMD, AVA-101 will likely compete with other treatments then available, including the off-label use of products already approved for marketing and other therapies currently available or which may be developed; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights.\nOf the large number of biologics and drugs in development in the pharmaceutical industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market AVA-101, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development programs, we cannot assure you that AVA-101 will be successfully developed or commercialized. If we decide to invest in the continued development and potential commercialization of AVA-101 and we or any of our future development partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, successfully commercialize, AVA-101, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nOur product candidates other than AVA-101 are still in preclinical development, and we are conducting additional preclinical studies relating to our wet AMD program, including AVA-101. If we are unable to commercialize our product candidates or if we experience significant delays in obtaining regulatory approval for, or commercializing, any or all of our product candidates, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur product candidates, other than AVA-101, are still in preclinical development, and we are conducting additional preclinical studies relating to our wet AMD program, including AVA-101. Our ability to generate product revenue will depend heavily on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize these product candidates. We do not expect that such commercialization of any of our product candidates will occur for at least the next several years, if ever. Our ability to commercialize our product candidates effectively will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials, including the ability to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nreceipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u00b7\nestablishing commercial manufacturing capabilities, for example, by making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully launching commercial sales of the product, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payers;\n\u00b7\nestablishing market share while competing with other therapies;\n\u00b7\na continued acceptable safety profile of our products following regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining compliance with post-approval regulation and other requirements; and\n\u00b7\nqualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering our product candidates.\nIf we, or our collaborators, do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to commercialize our product candidates, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have conducted, and may in the future conduct, clinical trials for product candidates in sites outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\nWe have conducted, and may in the future choose to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. For example, we recently conducted a Phase 1/2a trial for AVA-101 with LEI in Australia.\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The study population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical studies conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to label the product in the United States. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the studies also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from our clinical trials for our product candidates, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of our product candidates.\nOur gene therapy platform is based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. At the moment, no gene therapy products have been approved in the United States and only one gene therapy product has been approved in Europe.\nWe have concentrated our research and development efforts on our gene therapy platform and our future success depends on the successful development of product candidates based on this platform. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our platform will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical studies or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nIn addition, the clinical study requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators may use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K the FDA has not approved any gene therapy products for sale and only one gene therapy product has been approved in the Western world, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in either Europe or the United States. Approvals by the EMA may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval.\nRegulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products may change in the future. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical studies conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) may also be subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities\u2019 Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process can impede the initiation of a clinical study, even if the FDA has reviewed the study and approved its initiation. Clinical trial sites in the United States that receive NIH funding for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are required to follow RAC recommendations, or risk losing NIH funding for such research or needing NIH pre-approval before conducting such research.\nConversely, the FDA can put an Investigational New Drug application (IND) on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review. Also, before a clinical study can begin at an NIH-funded institution, that institution\u2019s institutional review board (IRB) and its Institutional Biosafety Committee will have to review the proposed clinical study to assess the safety of the study. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates.\nThese regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we may be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify, develop and commercialize products based on our platform. Although our AVA-101 product candidate was in clinical development, we decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015. In addition, our research programs, including those subject to our collaboration with Regeneron, may fail to identify other potential product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. Our research methodology may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates or our potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nWe have not tested any of our internally-developed viral vectors, or product candidates derived from these viral vectors, in clinical trials.\nDrug development has inherent risk. We recently conducted a Phase 1/2a human clinical trial for AVA-101, which is produced in a mammalian-cell based manufacturing system. However, neither AVA-101 manufactured in the baculovirus expression system (BVES) nor our other product candidates have ever been evaluated in human clinical studies, and we may experience unexpected results in the future. We or any of our future development partners will be required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates containing our proprietary vectors are safe and effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results. Any product candidate we or any of our future development partners advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\nIf our proprietary vectors are not shown to be safe and effective in targeting retinal tissue, we may not realize the value of our investment in directed evolution technology. In addition, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Furthermore, any future trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy for approval by regulatory authorities in larger patient populations. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. For example, following analysis of the data generated in our Phase 2a clinical trial of AVA-101, we concluded that, overall, we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase 2a study. In addition, only a small percentage of products under development result in the submission of a BLA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nWe cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we plan will be successful, and any safety concerns observed in any one of our clinical trials in our targeted indications could limit the prospects for regulatory approval of our product candidates in those and other indications.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time consuming, and such regulation may cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive regulatory approval from the FDA. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications and patient population. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nThe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our or any of our future development partners\u2019 clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe or any of our future development partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that of the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe results of clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by such authorities for approval;\n\u00b7\nwe or any of our future development partners may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\napproval may be granted only for indications that are significantly more limited than what we apply for and/or with other significant restrictions on distribution and use;\n\u00b7\nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or any of our future development partners contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or\n\u00b7\nthe approval policies or regulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our or any of our future development partners\u2019 clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us or any of our future development partners from commercializing our product candidates.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling subjects in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nSubject enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. We will be required to identify and enroll a sufficient number of subjects with the relevant eye disease we are targeting for any future clinical trials for our product candidates. Potential subjects may not be adequately diagnosed or identified with the diseases which we are targeting or may not meet the entry criteria for our studies. We also may encounter difficulties in identifying and enrolling subjects with a stage of disease appropriate for such future clinical trials. In addition, we and our collaboration partner, Regeneron, are developing AVA-311 for the treatment of X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), an orphan indication. Enrollment of eligible subjects with orphan diseases may be limited or slower than we anticipate in light of the small subject populations involved. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to locate a sufficient number of eligible subjects to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, the process of finding and diagnosing subjects may prove costly.\nFurther, if patients are unwilling to participate in our gene therapy studies because of negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or gene therapy industries or inadequate results in our preclinical or clinical studies or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations or available approved therapies, our recruitment of subjects, conduct of studies and ability to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates may be hindered.\nTrials using early versions of retroviral vectors, which integrate with, and thereby alter, the host cell\u2019s DNA, have led to several well-publicized adverse events. For example, generalized public backlash developed against gene therapy following the death in September 1999 of an 18-year-old who had volunteered for a gene therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania. Researchers at the university had infused the volunteer\u2019s liver with a gene aimed at reversing a rare metabolic disease of the liver. The procedure triggered an extreme immune-system reaction that caused multiple-organ failure in a very short time, leading to the first death to occur as a direct result of a gene therapy experiment. In addition, in 2003, 20 subjects treated for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency in two gene therapy studies using a murine gamma-retroviral vector showed correction of the disease, but the studies were terminated after five subjects developed leukemia (four of whom were subsequently cured). The cause of these adverse events was shown to be insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the corrected gene inserts near a gene that is important in a critical cellular process like growth or division, and this insertion results in the development of a cancer (often leukemia). Using molecular diagnostic techniques, it was determined that clones from these subjects showed retrovirus insertion in proximity to the promoter of the LMO2 proto-oncogene. Earlier generation retroviruses like the one used in these two studies have been shown to preferentially integrate in regulatory regions of genes that control cell growth. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for any of our future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nWe believe we have appropriately accounted for the above factors in our trials when determining expected clinical trial timelines, but we cannot assure you that our assumptions are correct or that we will not experience delays in enrollment, which would result in the delay of completion of such trials beyond our expected timelines.\nThe occurrence of serious complications or side effects in connection with use of our product candidates, either in clinical trials or post-approval, could lead to discontinuation of our clinical development program, refusal of regulatory authorities to approve our product candidates or, post-approval, revocation of marketing authorizations or refusal to approve new indications, which could severely harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our product candidates. It is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical programs, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by subjects. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational products are tested in large-scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates has side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which would severely harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nAVA-101 may be studied in diseases of the eye in addition to AMD if we continue development of AVA-101. There are many potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of VEGF that may limit our ability to successfully develop and/or commercialize AVA-101. These serious and potentially life-threatening risks, based on clinical and preclinical experience of VEGF inhibitors, include bleeding, intestinal perforation, hypertension, proteinuria, congestive heart failure, heart attack, stroke and geographic atrophy. In addition, patients given infusions of any protein may develop severe hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF inhibitors have reported side effects that became evident only after large-scale trials or after marketing approval when large numbers of patients were treated. There are risks in treating patients with gene therapy vectors, including adeno-associated virus (AAV), such as inflammation, cytotoxic T-cell response, anti-AAV antibodies and immune response to the expressed transgene, including T-cell responses and/or auto-antibodies against sFlt-1. There are risks inherent in the subretinal administration of drugs like AVA-101, which can cause injury to the eye and other complications. For example, in our Phase 1/2a trials of AVA-101 in wet AMD, the most frequent ocular adverse events were conjunctival hemorrhage, cataracts, retinal hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage.\nThere are also risks inherent in subretinal injections, including subretinal injections with AVA-101, such as intraocular inflammation, cataract, sterile and culture positive endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, retinal tear, epiretinal membrane (ERM) formation, and other side effects. Serious complications or serious, unexpected side effects in connection with the use of AVA-101 could materially harm our business, prospects\u2019 operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet our deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We are dependent on third parties to conduct preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates, and, therefore, the timing of the initiation and completion of these trials is controlled by such third parties and may occur at times substantially different from our estimates. Specifically, we use clinical research organizations (CROs) to conduct our clinical trials and rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, CROs and consultants to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and regulatory requirements. Our CROs, investigators and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and subsequent collection and analysis of data.\nThere is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators or other third parties on which we rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fails to meet expected deadlines, fails to adhere to our clinical protocols, fails to meet regulatory requirements, or otherwise performs in a substandard manner, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of our clinical trial sites terminates for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on subjects enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer those subjects to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of any BLA we submit by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to conduct some or all aspects of our vector production, product manufacturing, protocol development, research and preclinical and clinical testing, and these third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not expect to independently conduct all aspects of our vector production, product manufacturing, protocol development, research and preclinical and clinical testing. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties with respect to these items.\nAny of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it could delay our product development activities. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required regulations and study protocols. For example, for product candidates that we develop and commercialize on our own, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our IND-enabling studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the study plan and protocols.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated study plans and protocols, we will not be able to complete, or may be delayed in completing, the preclinical and clinical studies required to support future IND submissions and approval of our product candidates.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u00b7\nthe inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7\nreduced control as a result of using third-party manufacturers for all aspects of manufacturing activities;\n\u00b7\ntermination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us; and\n\u00b7\ndisruptions to the operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier.\nAny of these events could lead to clinical study delays or failure to obtain regulatory approval, or impact our ability to successfully commercialize future products.\nWe and our contract manufacturer are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our products. The manufacturing facility on which we rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and may have limited capacity.\nWe currently have relationships with a single supplier for the manufacturing of our viral vectors and product candidates. The supplier may require licenses to manufacture such components if such processes are not owned by the supplier or in the public domain and we may be unable to transfer or sublicense the intellectual property rights we may have with respect to such activities. All entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical studies or commercial sale, including our existing contract manufacturer for our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical studies must be manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. We or our contract manufacturer must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA\u2019s current Good Laboratory Practice regulations and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. Our contract manufacturer has not produced a commercially-approved product and therefore has not obtained the requisite FDA approvals to do so. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates or any of our other potential products. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party contractors involved with the preparation of our product candidates or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If the facility does not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval of the products will not be granted.\nThe regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical study or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Such violations could also result in civil and/or criminal penalties. Any such remedial measures or other civil and/or criminal penalties imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturer fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or biologic product, revocation of a pre-existing approval, other civil or criminal penalties or closing one or more manufacturing facilities. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nAdditionally, if supply from an approved manufacturer is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a BLA supplement which could result in further delay. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines.\nThese factors could cause the delay of clinical studies, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical studies may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to research and develop and to manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s independent discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of our third-party collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials for our product candidates, including AVA-101, could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nBefore we can initiate clinical trials in the United States for our product candidates, we need to submit the results of preclinical testing to the FDA, along with other information including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing and controls and our proposed clinical trial protocol, as part of an IND. We may rely in part on preclinical, clinical and quality data generated by CROs and other third parties for regulatory submissions for our product candidates. If these third parties do not make timely regulatory submissions for our product candidates, it will delay our plans for our clinical trials. If those third parties do not make this data available to us, we will likely have to develop all necessary preclinical and clinical data on our own, which will lead to significant delays and increase development costs of the product candidate. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing for any product candidate before it allows us to initiate clinical testing under any IND, which may lead to additional delays and increase the costs of our preclinical development. Delays in the commencement or completion of any clinical trials that we plan for our product candidates could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether any trials that we plan will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA failing to grant permission to proceed or placing the clinical trial on hold;\n\u00b7\nsubjects failing to enroll or remain in our trial at the rate we expect;\n\u00b7\nsubjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indication for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nsubjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u00b7\na facility manufacturing any of our product candidates or any of their components being ordered by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process;\n\u00b7\nany changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u00b7\nthird-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practice or regulatory requirements or other third parties not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u00b7\ninspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA or the finding of regulatory violations by the FDA or an IRB that require us to undertake corrective action, result in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire trial or that prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u00b7\nthird-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications; or\n\u00b7\none or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing its approval of the trial.\nProduct development costs will increase if we have delays in testing or approval of any of our product candidates, or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of our clinical trials, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical trial sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for a product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. For example, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Further, if one or more clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced. For example, in the third quarter of 2015, we decided not to move forward with the Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 with the dose and administration procedure that we had planned to initiate in the second half of 2015, and, as a result, our competitors may be able to bring wet AMD products to the market ahead of us and the commercial viability of AVA-101 could be reduced.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones will be based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFinal marketing approval for our product candidates by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for commercial use may be delayed, limited or denied, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenue.\nAfter the completion of our clinical trials and, assuming the results of the trials are successful, the submission of a BLA, we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates, and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenue. We cannot commercialize our product candidates until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the applicable applications. We cannot assure you that the regulatory agencies will complete their review processes in a timely manner or that we will obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. If marketing approval for any product candidate is delayed, limited or denied, our ability to market the product candidate, and our ability to generate product sales, would be adversely affected.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, they could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nEven if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time consuming post-approval studies, post-market surveillance or clinical trials. Following approval, if at all, of any of our product candidates, such candidate will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requesting recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we or the manufacturing facilities for any product candidate that may receive regulatory approval fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u00b7\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements or applications filed by us;\n\u00b7\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u00b7\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of product or request us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue. The FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy plan as part of a BLA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates is approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for a product candidate, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval we still may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidate, and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, could be limited.\nEven if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers, is also generally necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndemonstration of clinical efficacy and safety compared to other more-established products;\n\u00b7\nthe limitation of our targeted patient population and other limitations or warnings contained in any FDA-approved labeling;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of a new formulation by health care providers and their patients;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u00b7\nnew procedures or methods of treatment that may be more effective in treating or may reduce the incidences of wet AMD or other conditions for which our products are intended to treat;\n\u00b7\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers;\n\u00b7\nunfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate; and\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage and reimbursement.\nIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payers or patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from that product candidate and may not become or remain profitable. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of such a product candidate may require significant resources and may never be successful. In addition, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidate will depend on our ability to manufacture our products, differentiate our products from competing products and defend and enforce our intellectual property rights relating to our products.\nIf the market for the treatment of wet AMD is smaller than we believe it is, our future revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nIf the size of the market for wet AMD is smaller than we anticipate, we may not be able to achieve profitability and growth. While we are initially targeting product candidates for the treatment of wet AMD, a disease we believe to be the most common cause of vision loss in adults over the age of 50 in developed countries, our projections of the number of people who have wet AMD, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with wet AMD, are based on estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations and market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are very small, we may never achieve profitability despite obtaining such significant market share.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors including the third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product candidate is:\n\u00b7\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u00b7\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7\ncost-effective; and\n\u00b7\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product candidate from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of the applicable product candidate to the payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Further, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only in limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our product candidates profitably, or at all, even if approved.\nAs a result of legislative proposals and the trend toward managed health care in the United States, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. By way of example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient drug purchases by those covered by Medicare under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs, including drugs currently on the market used by physicians to treat wet AMD and likely AVA-101, if approved. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, there is additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of the MMA could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products, and could seriously harm our business.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, was enacted with a goal of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain prescription drugs.\nOther legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken.\nWe expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal, state and foreign governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products, if approved, or additional pricing pressures.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect:\n\u00b7\nthe demand for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u00b7\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;\n\u00b7\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of capital.\nDue to the novel nature of our technology and the potential for our product candidates to offer therapeutic benefit in a single administration, we face uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement for these product candidates.\nOur product candidates are designed to provide potential therapeutic benefit after a single administration and, therefore, the pricing and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved, must be adequate to support commercial infrastructure. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell our product candidates will be adversely affected. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our product candidates (e.g., for administration of our product to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products.\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.\nAlthough the development and commercialization of gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD is our primary focus, as part of our longer-term growth strategy, we plan to evaluate the development and commercialization of other gene therapies related to ocular diseases. We will evaluate internal opportunities from our library of adeno-associated virus (AAV) variants, and also may choose to in-license or acquire other product candidates as well as commercial products to treat patients suffering from ocular diseases such as diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), glaucoma, XLRS or other disorders with high unmet medical needs and limited treatment options. These other product candidates will require additional, time-consuming development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, clinical trials and approval by the FDA and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and/or effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace or be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nWe are subject to many manufacturing risks, any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of our products.\nThe process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to several risks, including:\n\u00b7\nThe manufacturing of biologics is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facility in which our products are made, such manufacturing facility may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.\n\u00b7\nThe manufacturing facility in which our products are made could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor shortages, contaminants, raw materials shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors.\n\u00b7\nWe and our contract manufacturer must comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and guidelines. We and our contract manufacturer may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. We and our contract manufacturer are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow cGMP or other regulatory requirements or any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to comply with regulatory requirements or pass any regulatory authority inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. This may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for our clinical studies or the termination or hold on a clinical study, or the delay or prevention of a filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approvals for our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could be costly and damage our reputation. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, injunctions or criminal prosecution.\n\u00b7\nOur product candidates are biologics and require processing steps that are more complex than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Moreover, unlike chemical pharmaceuticals, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as our product candidates generally cannot be adequately characterized prior to manufacturing the final product. As a result, an assay of the finished product is not sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we expect to employ multiple steps to attempt to control our manufacturing process to assure that the process works and the product or product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process.\n\u00b7\nProblems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims and insufficient inventory.\n\u00b7\nSome of the raw materials required in our manufacturing process are derived from biological sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may also be subject to contamination or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our product candidates could adversely impact or disrupt commercialization.\n\u00b7\nAny adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. We may encounter problems achieving adequate or clinical-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other applicable standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development or other strategic collaborations, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates.\nWe have entered into development or other strategic collaborations with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. For example, our research collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron, which was announced in May 2014, covers up to eight distinct therapeutic targets, in which we could earn up to $80.0 million in development and regulatory milestones for product candidates directed toward each therapeutic target, for a combined total of up to $640.0 million in potential milestone payments for product candidates directed toward all eight therapeutic targets, and low- to mid-single digit royalties on worldwide net sales of collaboration product candidates. For any two therapeutic targets, we have an option to share up to 35% of the worldwide product candidate development costs and profits.\nSome of our strategic partners may terminate any agreements they enter into with us, and we may not be able to adequately protect our rights under these agreements. Furthermore, our strategic partners have negotiated for certain rights to control decisions regarding the development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, and may not conduct those activities in the same manner as we do.\nMoreover, if we fail to maintain development or other strategic collaborations related to our product candidates that we may choose to enter into:\n\u00b7\nthe development of certain of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;\n\u00b7\nour cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly, and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted; and\n\u00b7\nwe will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates.\nWe may form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances.\nWe may form strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business, including for the continued development or commercialization of our product candidates. These relationships or those like them may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because third parties may view the risk of failure in future clinical trials as too significant or the commercial opportunity for our product candidate as too limited. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish development partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us, and we may not be able to maintain such development partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product candidate are disappointing. Any delay in entering into development partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for the target indications of our product candidates that are approved more quickly than ours, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe operate in highly competitive segments of the biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies as well as with new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. There are a variety of drug candidates in development for the indications that we intend to test. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product candidate development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, universities and private and public research institutes may be active in wet AMD research, and some could be in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and clinical development personnel. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, registering subjects for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nNew developments, including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Competition in drug development is intense. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, the availability and price of our competitors\u2019 products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for our product candidates. For example, EYLEA\u00ae is currently available in the United States for treatment of wet AMD and macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), and in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Japan and certain other countries for the treatment of wet AMD. Additionally, marketing approval has been obtained in the EU for EYLEA\u00ae for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to CRVO. We will not achieve our business plan if the acceptance of our product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances. Our inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug products would have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur potential competitors in these diseases may be developing novel immune modulating therapies that may be safer or more effective than our product candidates, including AVA-101. For example, if we resume clinical development of, and seek to commercialize, AVA-101, AVA-101 will compete with a variety of therapies currently marketed and in development for wet AMD, using therapeutic modalities such as biologics, small molecules and gene therapy. Lucentis\u00ae, EYLEA\u00ae and Avastin\u00ae are anti-VEGF therapies that are well established and widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers as the standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD. There are several other companies with marketed products or products in development for the treatment of wet AMD, including Allergan, Iconic Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., Ophthotech Corporation, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Regeneron, Santen Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, ReGenX Biosciences LLC, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Oxford Biomedica plc, Ohr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Mesoblast Limited.\nOur preclinical product candidates are being developed for the treatment of prevalent or rare ophthalmic diseases, such as the prevention of wet AMD and XLRS, for which there are no approved therapies. However, there are multiple companies developing gene therapies for ophthalmic diseases, including Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc., Eos Neuroscience, Inc., ReGenX Biosciences LLC, GenSight Biologics, Genzyme Corporation, Hemera Biosciences, Inc., RetroSense Therapeutics, LLC, Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Oxford Biomedica plc, Sanofi-Aventis S.A., NightStaRx Limited and 4D Molecular Therapeutics, LLC and Benitec Biopharma Limited.\nWe have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities, and we may have to invest significant resources to develop these capabilities.\nWe have no internal sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If any of our product candidates ultimately receive regulatory approval, we may not be able to effectively market and distribute the product candidate. We may have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources to develop internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved, if at all. We may not be able to hire consultants or external service providers to assist us in sales, marketing and distribution functions on acceptable financial terms or at all. Even if we determine to perform sales, marketing and distribution functions ourselves, we could face a number of additional related risks, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to attract and build an effective marketing department or sales force;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of establishing a marketing department or sales force may exceed our available financial resources and the revenue generated by any product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire; and\n\u00b7\nour direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful.\nGovernments may impose price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe intend to seek approval to market our product candidates in both the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product candidates. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy and genetic research may damage public perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain marketing approvals for our product candidates.\nPublic perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians specializing in the treatment of those diseases that our product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing symptomatic treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be available.\nMore restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, in 2003, trials using early versions of murine gamma-retroviral vectors, which integrate with, and thereby alter, the host cell\u2019s DNA, have led to several well-publicized adverse events, including reported cases of leukemia. Although none of our current product candidates utilize murine gamma-retroviral vectors, our product candidates use a viral delivery system. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. Although none of our current product candidates utilize the gamma-retroviruses used in the 2003 studies, our product candidates do use a viral vector delivery system. The risk of cancer remains a concern for gene therapy and we cannot assure that it will not occur in any of our future clinical studies. In addition, there is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biological activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material.\nAdverse events in our clinical trials or those conducted by other parties, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. If any such adverse events occur, development and commercialization of our product candidates or advancement of any potential clinical trials could be halted or delayed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe are dependent on the services of our key executives and scientific staff, and if we are not able to retain these members of our management or recruit additional management, clinical and scientific personnel, our business will suffer.\nWe are dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. The loss of service of any of our management could harm our business. In addition, we are dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified additional management, clinical and scientific personnel. If we are not able to retain our management, and to attract, on acceptable terms, additional qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business, we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow. Although we have executed employment agreements with each member of our current executive management team, these agreements are terminable at will with or without notice and, therefore, we may not be able to retain their services as expected.\nWe will need to expand and effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, and other resources in order to successfully pursue our development and commercialization efforts. Our success also depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management and scientific personnel in recent years. If we are not able to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nPaul B. Cleveland joined as our President and Chief Executive Officer in December 2015. In addition, as recently announced, upon the completion of the proposed Transaction with Annapurna, Amber Salzman, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Annapurna, will become our President, and Carlo Russo, M.D, chief medical officer and head of development at Annapurna, will become our Chief Medical Officer. We also continue to search for a permanent Chief Financial Officer. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate newly hired executive officers, including Mr. Cleveland, any newly hired Chief Financial Officer, and, if the Transaction is completed, Drs. Salzman and Russo, into our management team and our ability to develop an effective working relationship among senior management. Our failure to integrate these individuals and create effective working relationships among them and other members of management could result in inefficiencies in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our product candidates and our results of operations. Moreover, if the Transaction is consummated, Drs. Salzman and Russo would be based in Annapurna\u2019s Philadelphia office, and their location outside of our Menlo Park headquarters may make their integration into our organization more challenging.\nAdditionally, we do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on the lives of our executives or any of our employees. This lack of insurance means that we may not have adequate compensation for the loss of the services of these individuals.\nIf we fail to effectively integrate our new executive officers into our organization, the future development and commercialization of our product candidates may suffer, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our product candidates or our results of operations.\nOur current management team has only been working together for a relatively short period of time and some of our current management team, including Chief Executive Officer Paul B. Cleveland, have been employed by us for less than a year. Moreover, as recently announced, upon the completion of the proposed Transaction with Annapurna, Amber Salzman, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Annapurna, will become our President, and Carlo Russo, M.D, chief medical officer and head of development at Annapurna, will become our Chief Medical Officer. We also continue to search for a permanent Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we may continue to expand our management team in the future. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate recently and subsequently hired executive officers into our management team and their ability to develop and maintain an effective working relationship. Our failure to integrate these individuals with other members of management could result in inefficiencies in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our product candidates and our results of operations. Moreover, if the Transaction is consummated, Drs. Salzman and Russo would be based in Annapurna\u2019s Philadelphia office, and their location outside of our Menlo Park headquarters may make their integration into our organization more challenging. In addition to the competition for personnel, the San Francisco Bay Area in particular is characterized by a high cost of living. As such, we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nWe had 54 full-time employees as of February 29, 2016. We may need to grow our organization, or certain functions within our organization, substantially to continue development and pursue the potential commercialization of our product candidates, as well as function as a public company. As we seek to advance our product candidates, we may need to expand our financial, development,\nregulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management and require us to retain or otherwise manage additional internal capabilities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate any additional management, clinical and regulatory, financial, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to so accomplish could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable state and federal healthcare laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and/or exclusion from federal and/or healthcare programs.\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws and regulations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formula managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payers.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nAdditionally, the False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers\u2019 and manufacturers\u2019 compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we may also obtain certain confidential patient health information including retinal scans from subjects participating in our clinical trials. In the event of an inadvertent disclosure or security breach, we could be subject to\nenforcement measures, including civil and criminal penalties and fines for violations of state and federal privacy or security standards, such as HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. HIPAA, HITECH and comparable state laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. Any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws, to the extent such requirements are deemed to apply to our operations, could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe and our development partners, third-party manufacturer and suppliers use biological materials and may use hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe and our development partners, third-party manufacturer and suppliers may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations and the operations of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our other product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize our product candidates. For example, we may be sued if our product candidates allegedly caused or cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product candidate, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease the commercialization of our product candidates. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u00b7\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenue;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\na decline in our stock price.\nWe currently hold $5 million in product liability insurance, which may not adequately cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Our inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product candidates. Although we plan to maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies will also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe and any of our future development partners will be required to report to regulatory authorities if any of our approved products cause or contribute to adverse medical events, and any failure to do so would result in sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nIf we and any of our future development partners or CROs are successful in commercializing our products, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities would require that we and any of our future development partners report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We and any of our future development partners may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We and any of our future development partners may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we and any of our future development partners fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority could take action, including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our development partners, third-party clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors, consultants and collaborators are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other similar disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidate could be delayed.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants and vendors may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (1) FDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to regulatory authorities, (2) manufacturing standards, (3) federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations or (4) laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. Specifically, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates are subject in part to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by other companies and universities.\nWe currently are heavily reliant upon licenses of certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that is important or necessary to the development of our technology and products, including technology related to our manufacturing process and our gene therapy product candidates. These and other licenses may not provide adequate rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and products in the future. For example, the license granted to us by the Regents to make, have made, use, offer for sale, import, export and sell products covered by certain patent rights licensed to us under our agreement with the Regents is limited to the United States. The license is also limited to the Regents\u2019 interest in the licensed patent rights which are co-owned by Chiron Corporation (Chiron). As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing competitive products in territories not included in our licenses to patents.\nLicenses to additional third-party technology that may be required for our development programs may not be available in the future or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. In addition, we must obtain consent from the Regents before we can enforce patent rights licensed to us by the Regents. While such consent may not be unreasonably withheld, the Regents may withhold such consent or may not provide it on a timely basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent rights subject to our exclusive license with the Regents are jointly owned by Chiron Corporation.\nWe currently have a license to the Regents\u2019 undivided interest in certain patent rights relating to the use of recombinant gene delivery vectors for treating or preventing diseases of the eye. The licensed patent rights are jointly owned by the Regents and Chiron but our license extends only the Regents\u2019 interest in such patent rights. As a result, Chiron has a right to develop and commercialize products and technology using these patent rights, and to license to third parties the right to do so. This may lead to the development and commercialization of products and technology by others that are based on technology similar to our gene therapy platform, which may impair our competitive position in the marketplace and have an adverse impact on our business.\nJoint ownership of these patent rights may also limit our ability to effectively enforce our rights in these patents against alleged infringers. First, Chiron may be required to participate in any potential suit against such third party infringers but may not agree to do so. Additionally, Chiron may choose to license its interest in these patent rights to any such infringers without our consent in certain countries. Further, Chiron\u2019s joint ownership may limit the Regents\u2019 ability to prosecute related patent rights in foreign jurisdictions without the cooperation of Chiron. As a result, our business may be adversely impaired.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies, and their uses as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. There can be no assurance that our patent applications or those of our licensors will result in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around or invalidated by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. This failure to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nComposition-of-matter patents on the biological or chemical active pharmaceutical ingredient are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter of any of our product candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued composition-of-matter patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged.\nWe have an issued method-of-use patent in the United States that encompasses AVA-101. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method or for treatment of a particular indication. However, this type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case;\n\u00b7\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u00b7\npatents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u00b7\nour competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthere may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u00b7\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product candidates.\nIn addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently.\nAdditionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating our trade secrets. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nClaims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nThe biotechnology industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. Because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of our product candidates. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently-pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, identification of third party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and could:\n\u00b7\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u00b7\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u00b7\ncause development delays;\n\u00b7\nprevent us from commercializing our product candidates until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis; or\n\u00b7\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent our product candidates from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our product candidate or processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market our product candidates. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign our product candidate or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates may be dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek to obtain the right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the patents relating to our product candidates, there may be times when the filing and prosecution activities for platform technology patents that relate to our product candidates are controlled by our licensors. For example, we do not have the right to prosecute and maintain the patent rights licensed to us under agreements with each of the Regents and Virovek Corporation, and our ability to have input into such filing and prosecution activities is limited. If these licensors or any of our future licensors fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates or companion diagnostic, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates and companion diagnostic may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nIf we or any of our future development partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent directed at one of our product candidates, or one of our future product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable in whole or in part. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could include an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development or manufacturing partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Leahy-Smith Act), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO, and may become involved in post-grant proceedings including opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter-partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope or enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe currently have rights to the intellectual property, through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own, to develop our product candidates. Because our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license, or use these proprietary rights. For example, our product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and the rights to these formulations may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.\nWe sometimes collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution\u2019s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.\nIf we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of that program and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nWe may fail to comply with any of our obligations under existing agreements pursuant to which we license or have otherwise acquired intellectual property rights or technology, which could result in the loss of rights or technology that are material to our business.\nLicensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business, and scientific issues. Disputes may arise regarding our rights to intellectual property licensed to us from a third party, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u00b7\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights;\n\u00b7\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u00b7\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the creation or use of intellectual property by us, alone or with our licensors and collaborators;\n\u00b7\nthe scope and duration of our payment obligations;\n\u00b7\nour rights upon termination of such agreement; and\n\u00b7\nthe scope and duration of exclusivity obligations of each party to the agreement.\nIf disputes over intellectual property and other rights that we have licensed or acquired from third parties prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, in addition to our employees, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these employees and consultants, and many of our employees, were previously employed at, or may have previously provided or may be currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that our company, our employees or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension and data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Amendments). The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve a high degree of technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, Congress may pass patent reform legislation that is unfavorable to us. The Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents we might obtain in the future.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWhile we have issued patents directed at AVA-101 in the United States and pending patent applications directed at AVA-101 and other product candidates in the United States and other countries, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on AVA-101 and our other product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u00b7\nothers may be able to make gene therapies that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u00b7\nissued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u00b7\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u00b7\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe previously identified and have remediated a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to prepare accurate and timely consolidated financial statements being prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management will be required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with the annual report for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. When we lose our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and if we reach an accelerated filer threshold, our independent registered public accounting firm will also be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and the related report will also be required to be included in our annual reports filed with the SEC. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company and also not an accelerated filer, we intend to take advantage of an exemption available to companies meeting these criteria from these auditor attestation requirements. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 compliance requirements are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation. If we (or our auditors if they are required to assess and attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting) are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nOur management previously identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 and which related to the design and operation of our control environment. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2013, we did not maintain an effective control environment, which is the foundation for effective internal control over financial reporting, as evidenced by: (i) an insufficient number of personnel to perform control monitoring activities, (ii) an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge of U.S. GAAP to determine that our consolidated financial statements were properly prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, (iii) insufficient management involvement to identify and resolve errors in recording transactions and (iv) inadequate processes for the preparation and review of our consolidated financial statements.\nSubsequent to the identification of the material weakness, we hired an experienced Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller and additional skilled accounting and finance staff members, formalized and implemented our accounting policies and internal controls and the related documentation and strengthened our accounting systems, financial statements review procedures and the supervisory reviews by our management that are performed during the financial close process and which support the accurate and timely preparation of consolidated financial statements that are fairly presented in accordance with US GAAP. These improvements to our internal control infrastructure were implemented during 2014, and were in place in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAlthough we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014 we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Stock Market, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or other regulatory authorities. Failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, including failure to remediate any material weaknesses we or our auditors identify, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nAn active public market for our common stock may not persist.\nWe completed our initial public offering (IPO) on August 5, 2014 and our follow-on offering on January 13, 2015. Prior to the IPO, there had been no public market for shares of our common stock, and an active public market for our shares may not persist. The lack of an active market may impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price they consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other businesses, applications or technologies using our shares as consideration.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and could continue to be highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and others such as:\n\u00b7\nannouncements related to the Transaction;\n\u00b7\nsecurities or industry analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 perception of the Transaction;\n\u00b7\nour plans regarding further development of AVA-101;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enroll subjects in any clinical trials that we plan in the future;\n\u00b7\nresults of any clinical trials, and the results of trials of our competitors or those of other companies in our market sector;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems, especially in light of current reforms to the U.S. healthcare system;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7\nsales of our stock by insiders and stockholders;\n\u00b7\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock, and similar litigation has been instituted against us. Such litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and certain of our officers have been named defendants in purported securities class action lawsuits. These, and any additional securities litigation, could result in substantial losses and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nOn June 15, 2015, we announced the top-line results of our Phase 2a clinical trial for AVA-101. In July 2015, three purported securities class action lawsuits were commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants us and certain of our officers. These lawsuits assert that the defendants violated the Exchange Act and Securities Act and allege that the defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omitted allegedly material information related to, among other things, the Phase 2a clinical trial for AVA-101 and the prospects of AVA-101. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs, each on behalf of a purported class of persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired our publicly traded securities between July 31, 2014 and June 15, 2015. It is possible that additional suits will be filed with respect to these same matters and also naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants.\nIn addition, in December 2015, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against us, our board of directors, underwriters of our January 13, 2015, follow-on public stock offering, and two of our institutional stockholders, in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo. The complaint alleges that, in connection with our follow-on stock offering, the defendants violated the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements and by allegedly omitting material information related to the Phase 2a clinical trial for AVA-101 and the prospects of AVA-101. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and rescissory damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. However, the outcomes of these lawsuits are necessarily uncertain, and we may not prevail. In addition, while we have various insurance policies related to the risks associated with our business, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies, there is no assurance that our insurance coverage, which contains a self-insured retention, will be sufficient or that our insurance carriers will cover all claims or litigation costs. Accordingly, we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these suits. At this time, we are not able to estimate the possible costs to us from these matters, as these lawsuits are currently at an early stage and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve these matters or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. Decisions adverse to our interests in these actions could subject us to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the uncertainty of the currently pending litigation could lead to more volatility in our stock price. If our stock price continues to experience volatility, we may be the subject of additional securities litigation in the future.\nThe current securities litigation and any future litigation of this type could result in diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Monitoring and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to focus fully on our business activities.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe successful completion of the Transaction;\n\u00b7\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our clinical trial and development programs;\n\u00b7\naddition or termination of clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments affecting our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u00b7\nnature and terms of stock-based compensation grants; and\n\u00b7\nderivative instruments recorded at fair value.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock in future financings, stockholders may experience immediate dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders would experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our common stock sold at such discount. In addition, as opportunities present themselves, we may enter into financing or similar arrangements in the future, including the issuance of debt securities, preferred stock or common stock. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our common stockholders would experience additional dilution and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and may be able to exert control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of February 29, 2016, our executive officers, directors and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, own approximately 49.3% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, such persons, acting together, may have the ability to control our management and affairs and substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction. These persons also may have the ability to control our management and business affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nthe authorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nthe limitation of the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u00b7\na staggered board of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe elimination of the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to accelerate the vesting of outstanding option grants upon certain transactions that result in a change of control; and\n\u00b7\nthe establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we become a large accelerated filer (in which case we will cease to be an emerging company as of the date we become a large accelerated filer, which, generally, would occur if, at the end of a fiscal year, among other things, the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year (in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of December 31 of such fiscal year), or if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three year period before that time (in which case we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately). Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC, and The NASDAQ Global Market to implement provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted additional rules and regulations in these areas, such as mandatory \u201csay on pay\u201d voting requirements that will apply to us when we cease to be an emerging growth company. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nThe rules and regulations applicable to public companies have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. To the extent these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas\nof our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited by the Internal Revenue Code.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future and we may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. As of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $79.4 million to offset future federal income. NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2026. As of December 31, 2015, we also had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of approximately $56.5 million to offset future state income. U.S. State NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2016. If over a rolling three-year period, the cumulative change in our ownership exceeds 50 percentage points (as determined under applicable Treasury regulations) under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), our ability to utilize our U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset future taxable income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced at least two ownership changes since inception and our utilization of NOL carryforwards will therefore be subject to annual limitation. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards may be further limited as a result of subsequent ownership changes. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Such limitations could result in the expiration of our carryforwards before they can be utilized and, if we are profitable, our future cash flows could be adversely affected due to our increased tax liability.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Transaction\nThe announcement and pendency of the Transaction could have an adverse effect on our stock price, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Transaction could disrupt our business in a number of ways, which may include the following, among others:\n\u00b7\ninvestors may react negatively to the prospects of the combined company\u2019s business, resulting in a decline in our stock price;\n\u00b7\nthird parties may seek to terminate and/or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Transaction, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise; and\n\u00b7\nthe attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the Transaction and related matters and may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations, including from other opportunities that might be beneficial to us.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect our stock price or harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure to complete the Transaction could negatively impact our stock price and/or our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCompletion of the Transaction is conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders of the issuance of the shares of our common stock as consideration, the absence of any law or order preventing the Transaction, receipt of all required government approvals, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties, and compliance with the covenants of the parties. These conditions are described in more detail in the Acquisition Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.\nThe required conditions to closing may not be satisfied in a timely manner, or at all, or, if permissible, waived. If the Transaction is not completed for these or any other reasons, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and will be subject to a number of risks and consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Annapurna a termination fee of up to $6.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement;\n\u00b7\nwe must pay the substantial fees and expenses we incurred related to the Transaction, such as legal and accounting fees, even if the Transaction is not completed;\n\u00b7\nthe price of our common stock may decline and remain volatile; and\n\u00b7\nwe may experience negative reactions to the termination of the Transaction from third parties and employees.\nFurthermore, any delay in the completion of the Transaction, or any uncertainty about its completion, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price, business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows.\nThere will be no adjustments to the number of shares of our common stock that will be issued upon the completion of the Transaction, and therefore if the market price of our common stock increases prior to the completion of the Transaction, the fair value of the purchase price for Annapurna will increase correspondingly.\nThe number of shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Transaction will not be adjusted in the event of any increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock before the closing of the Transaction. As a result, the market value of our shares, as reflected in the market price of our common stock, may be substantially higher at the time of the closing of the Transaction than the market value at the time our board of directors approved the Transaction and the Acquisition Agreement. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate due to, among other things, changes in our business, operations or prospects, market assessments of the likelihood of completion of the Transaction, the timing of the completion of the Transaction, investors\u2019 views of the prospects for the combined entity, general market and economic conditions and other factors.\nWhile the Transaction is pending, we will be subject to contractual limitations that could adversely affect our business.\nThe Acquisition Agreement restricts us from taking certain specified actions while the Transaction is pending without Annapurna\u2019s consent, including incurring or guaranteeing indebtedness, making capital expenditures in excess of $250,000, acquiring any material assets or selling, leasing or otherwise disposing of any assets or properties, and selling, transferring, licensing or otherwise disposing of any of our intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions in the ordinary course of business. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities that may arise and making other changes to our business prior to the closing of the Transaction or termination of the Acquisition Agreement.\nThe Acquisition Agreement restricts our ability to pursue certain alternatives to the Acquisition and requires us to pay a termination fee to Annapurna if we do.\nThe Acquisition Agreement contains non-solicitation provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to initiate, solicit or encourage or take any action to discuss or accept a competing third-party proposal. Although our board of directors is permitted to change its recommendation that stockholders approve the matters relating to the Transaction if it determines in good faith that these actions are reasonably likely to be required to comply with its fiduciary duties and certain other conditions, doing so in certain situations would require us to pay a reverse termination fee to Annapurna of $4.0 million. Furthermore, we will have to pay a reverse termination fee of $6.0 million (less the $4.0 million termination fee described above, if paid) if the agreement is terminated due to our board of directors making such change in recommendation and either (i) we consummate within twelve months of such termination an alternative transaction that was publicly announced or communicated in writing to our board of directors prior to such termination or (ii) we consummate within six months of such termination an alternative transaction that is first publicly announced or otherwise communicated in writing to our board of directors following such termination while an alternative transaction described in the foregoing clause (i) remains outstanding and not withdrawn.\nAdditionally, these non-solicitation provisions could discourage a potential acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our company from considering or proposing that acquisition, or might result in a potential acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire our company than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable to Annapurna in certain circumstances.\nWe have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the Transaction.\nWe have incurred and will incur additional substantial expenses in connection with the Transaction, whether or not the Transaction is completed. These costs include fees for financial advisors, attorneys and accountants, filing fees and financial printing costs. If the Transaction is not consummated, we will be responsible for our own expenses, which are not reimbursable in the event the Transaction does not occur. Upon completion of the Transaction, the amount of transaction costs, including the amount of Annapurna\u2019s transaction costs, will, in effect, reduce the cash reserves available for the combined company to pursue its plan of business.\nOur directors and officers may have interests in the Transaction that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally that may influence them to support or approve the Transaction.\nOur officers and directors may have interests in the Transaction that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders. For example, upon the closing of the Transaction, we will grant Mr. Cleveland options under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan to purchase 381,000 shares of our common stock with a per share exercise price equal to the closing sales price of our common stock on NASDAQ on the closing date. These differing or additional interests may influence our officers and directors to support or approve the Transaction.\nRisks Related to the Combined Company if the Transaction is Completed\nThe Transaction, if successfully completed, will transform Avalanche from a company developing product candidates for the treatment of eye diseases into a gene therapy company with a diverse pipeline of gene therapy product candidates. We may encounter challenges in implementing this transformation and the integration of Avalanche and Annapurna that could adversely impact the business and operations of the combined company.\nTo date, all of our development efforts have been focused on developing product candidates for the treatment of eye diseases. Annapurna\u2019s pipeline includes gene therapy product candidates designed to treat a range of diseases. The most advanced product candidate in Annapurna\u2019s pipeline is ANN-001, which is designed to deliver alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, or A1AT, in patients with A1AT, a rare genetic disorder which may result in serious respiratory disease in adults and, less commonly, liver disease at any age. Other product candidates in Annapurna\u2019s pipeline are designed to treat patients with hereditary angioedema, Friedreich\u2019s Ataxia and severe allergies. If the Transaction is consummated, we intend to continue to advance both our and Annapurna\u2019s current development programs. As a result, we will transform from a company focused solely on gene therapy treatments for eye diseases to a gene therapy company with a diverse pipeline of product candidates.\nThis transformation into a diversified gene therapy company poses risks relating to implementing a new business and operational strategy, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing development of product candidates for the treatment of eye diseases;\n\u00b7\ndemands on our management and our limited resources related to the increase in number and diversification of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in coordinating research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nthe establishment of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u00b7\nuncertainties in the business relationships with our collaborators and suppliers due to the Transaction and the transformation.\nAdditionally, various decisions regarding management restructuring, operational staffing and reporting systems following the Transaction have not yet been finalized, and there can be no guarantee that Avalanche and Annapurna will operate successfully as a combined company. Integration of the two companies and consolidation of their operations will require considerable time and attention from management, which could result in the diversion of management resources from other important matters. Moreover, if the Transaction is consummated, we expect that Drs. Salzman and Russo will be based in Annapurna\u2019s Philadelphia office and certain Annapurna operations will continue to be based in Annapurna\u2019s Paris office. Their location outside of our Menlo Park headquarters may make their integration into our organization more challenging.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage these or other risks and uncertainties relating to the combination of our and Annapurna\u2019s businesses, there will likely be adverse impacts on the business and operations of the combined company.\nAll of our and Annapurna\u2019s product candidates are still under preclinical development and may never advance to clinical testing or be successfully commercialized, which could materially and adverse impact the value of our common stock.\nAll of our and Annapurna\u2019s product candidates are still under preclinical development and may never advance to clinical testing or be successfully commercialized. The failure to enter clinical development for and ultimately successfully commercialize one or more of Annapurna\u2019s current product candidates will significantly diminish the anticipated benefits of the Transaction and may materially and adversely affect the business and prospects of the combined company. Consequently, we cannot assure you that our transformation into a diversified gene therapy company upon completion of the Transaction will be successful, and the Transaction could depress the value of our common stock.\nThe Transaction will result in changes to our board of directors that may affect the combined company\u2019s business strategy and operations.\nIf the Transaction is completed, our board of directors will expand to nine members, comprising our five current directors and four new directors. This newly composed board of directors of the combined company may effect business strategies and operating decisions with respect to the combined company that may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the Transaction.\nCurrent stockholders will have reduced ownership and voting interests after the Transaction.\nWe will issue to Annapurna\u2019s shareholders approximately 17.6 million shares of our common stock (inclusive of shares of our common stock underlying vested and unvested options, as calculated on a treasury method basis) as consideration in the Transaction. Upon completion of the Transaction, our current stockholders will own approximately 62.5% of the combined company and Annapurna shareholders will own approximately 37.5% of the combined company (calculated on a treasury method basis as of January 28, 2016). As a result, the ownership and voting interests in Avalanche of our current stockholders will be significantly reduced immediately following the Transaction. This reduction in ownership and voting interests will decrease the ability of our current stockholders to influence the election of directors and other matters. In addition, our current stockholders will experience dilution in their interest in our earnings per share.\nThe market price of our common stock following the completion of the Transaction is expected to be volatile and may drop following completion of the Transaction.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations following the completion of the Transaction. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies, including gene-therapy companies, have historically been particularity volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate following completion of the Transaction include:\n\u00b7\nour plans regarding further development of AVA-101 and any of the combined company\u2019s other product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of the combined company to obtain regulatory approvals for its product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals, including approval to begin clinical trials for ANN-001 in 2016;\n\u00b7\nthe results of any clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfailure of any of the combined company\u2019s product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u00b7\nfailure to maintain the combined company\u2019s existing third-party license and supply agreements;\n\u00b7\nfailure by the combined company or its licensors to prosecute, maintain or enforce its intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to the combined company\u2019s product candidates;\n\u00b7\nany inability to obtain adequate supply of the combined company\u2019s product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u00b7\nadverse regulatory authority decisions;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new products, services or technologies by its competitors;\n\u00b7\nfailure to meet or exceed the expectations of financial or industry analysts;\n\u00b7\nfailure to achieve the perceived benefits of the Transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by the combined company or its competitors;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u00b7\nsales of its common stock by the combined company or its stockholders in the future;\n\u00b7\ntrading volume of the combined company\u2019s common stock;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nadverse publicity relating to the gene therapy market generally, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with potential products of the combined company; and\n\u00b7\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in the combined company\u2019s financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the combined organization\u2019s profitability and reputation.", "PERMNO": 14790, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ADVM"}
