Risk Factors\nIn your evaluation of our Company and business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with information included elsewhere within this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as our ability to collect receivables, overall U.S. and global economic and industry conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters, climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business, financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in the price of our stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe depend on U.S. government agencies as our primary customer and, if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenues and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nWe generated either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government over 95% of our total revenues during each of the last three fiscal years from contracts with the U.S. government. Moreover, we generated over 60% of our total revenues during each of the last three fiscal years from the DoD, including 29% and 16% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016 from the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, respectively. We expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from work performed under U.S. government contracts. Our reputation and relationship with the U.S. government, and in particular with the agencies of the DoD, are key factors in maintaining and growing these revenues. Furthermore, each of these agencies has a number of subordinate agencies which have separate budgets and procurement functions and we may also be adversely affected if our reputation or relationships with these subordinate agencies are harmed. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation. Publicity that could harm our reputation might pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct, conflicts of interest, poor contract performance, deficiencies in services or other deliverables, information security breaches or other aspects of our business. If our reputation is negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our future revenues, cash flows, and financial results would be adversely affected.\nA decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, the failure to approve U.S. government budgets on a timely basis or delays in contract awards and other procurement activity may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues, cash flow and financial results.\nBecause we generate substantially all of our revenues from contracts with U.S. government agencies, our operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in budgetary priorities, as well as by delays in the government budget process, program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts. Current U.S. government spending levels for defense-related and other programs may not be sustained. Future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts. Such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of shifts in spending priorities from defense-related and other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds and the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nOn November 2, 2015, the President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the Budget Act). The Budget Act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the debt ceiling) until March 2017 and raises the sequestration caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the Budget Control Act) by $80 billion, split equally between defense and domestic spending, over the next two years ($50 billion in government fiscal year (GFY) 2016 and $30 billion in GFY 2017). Sequestration caps initially were put in place for GFY 2013, which resulted in $37 billion in across the board reduction to the defense budget authority. On December 18, 2015, Congress passed and the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which provides funding for the U.S. government for FY 2016, providing $1.1 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through September 2016. However, unless Congress and the Administration can reach a new agreement by the end of GFY 2017, the full effect of sequestration will once again take effect in GFY 2018. Further, unforeseen circumstances could cause requested spending to exceed the debt ceiling, which could result in the delay of the U.S. government's timely payment of our billings, resulting in delayed cash collection, and have significant consequences for our company, our employees, our suppliers and the defense industry.\nIn years when the U.S. government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, government operations typically are funded through one or more continuing resolutions that authorize agencies of the U.S. government to continue to operate, but do not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in contract awards due to lack of funding. Continuing resolutions have been used frequently in recent years, including GFY 2016, which operated under this funding mechanism from the October 1, 2015 start of the year until the full appropriations bill was passed on December 18, 2015.\nIf a continuing resolution is used to fund all or some U.S. government operations after GFY 2016, it may cause additional government contract awards to be delayed, canceled, or funded at lower levels and could adversely impact our operations, cash flows and financial results. Failure to complete its budget or to provide for a continuing resolution may result in a federal government shutdown, which could cause us to incur labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts or the delay or cancellation of key programs, and could adversely impact our operations, cash flows and financial results.\nThe U.S. government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities which may shift DoD budgetary priorities, reduce overall spending or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues. A significant decline in overall U.S. government spending, a significant shift in spending priorities, the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defense-related programs or significant budget-related delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects.\nOur failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties, including termination of our U.S. government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. government contracts and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. Some significant statutes and regulations that affect us include:\n\u2022\nthe FAR and agency supplements, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with certain contract awards;\n\u2022\nthe Procurement Integrity Act, which restricts access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information and limits our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials;\n\u2022\nthe Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial damages and civil penalties for submission of a false claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval; and\n\u2022\nthe U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which impose requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nMany of our U.S. government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers. OCI arises when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the U.S. government, impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. Existing OCI, and any OCI that may develop, could preclude our competition for or performance on a significant project or contract, which could limit our opportunities.\nThe U.S. government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time.\nOur industry continues to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies and recovery of costs, among other items. U.S. government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Legislation, regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform, mitigation of potential OCI\u2019s, deterrence of fraud, and environmental responsibility or sustainability could have an adverse effect on us. Moreover, shifts in the buying practices of U.S. government agencies (such as increased usage of fixed price contracts, multiple award contracts and small business set-aside contracts) could have adverse effects on government contractors, including us. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or contract renewals. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues, profitability and prospects.\nOur business is subject to reviews, audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash flows or growth prospects.\nThe Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and others routinely audit and review a contractor\u2019s performance on government contracts, indirect cost rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s compliance with government standards for its business systems, which are defined as the contractor\u2019s accounting, earned value management, estimating, materials management, property management and purchasing systems. A finding of significant control deficiencies in a contractor\u2019s business systems or a finding of noncompliance with CAS can result in decremented billing rates to U.S. government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and their remediation is accepted by the DCMA. The agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. As a result, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted which has increased the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome.\nGovernment audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds. Such adjustments can be applied retroactively, which could result in significant customer refunds. Receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an \u201capproved\u201d determination on our various business systems could significantly and adversely affect our business by, among other things, restricting our ability to bid on new contracts and, for those proposals under evaluation, diminishing our competitive position. A determination of noncompliance could also result in the U.S. government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including withholding of payments, suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny. Increased scrutiny could adversely impact our ability to perform on contracts, affect our ability to invoice for work performed, delay the receipt of timely payment on contracts, and weaken our ability to compete for new contracts with the U.S. government.\nThe indirect cost audits by the DCAA of our business remain open for fiscal 2011 and subsequent years. We have recorded contract revenues subsequent to and including fiscal 2011 based on an estimate of costs that we believe will be approved on final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or whether future adjustments will exceed our reserves for potential adjustments.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nWe have recorded reserves for estimated net amounts to be refunded to customers for potential adjustments for indirect cost audits and compliance with CAS for indemnification obligations owing to former Parent for periods prior to the spin-off date. Any additional amounts which may be determined to be owed for periods prior to the separation will be allocated to former Parent and us in proportions determined in accordance with the Distribution Agreement. Additional amounts that are allocated to us could have a material, adverse impact to our profitability and cash flows. For a more detailed discussion of the terms of the Distribution Agreement governing financial impacts of audits and reviews for periods prior to the spin-off, see Note 15 of the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements contained within this report.\nOur business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our profitability, cash position and growth prospects.\nWe are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to our contracts and operations. If a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions which could include the termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, the triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies. We may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals. Penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry. If we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation, our profitability, cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe U.S. government may terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at any time and, if we do not replace them, we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and may suffer a decline in revenues and profitability.\nMany of the U.S. government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor may extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years. Under our contracts, the U.S. government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience. Any decision by the U.S. government not to exercise contract options or to terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues, revenue growth and profitability.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts. If a government customer terminates a contract for default, we may be exposed to liability, including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and solutions from another source. Depending on the nature and value of the contract, a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation.\nWe face aggressive competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and may affect our future revenues, profitability and growth prospects.\nWe expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process as the U.S. government increasingly relies on IDIQ, GSA Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders. For contracts awarded to us, we also face the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win. Following contract award, we may encounter significant expense, delay, contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding. Any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues and/or profitability. In addition, multi-award contracts require that we make sustained post-award efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. As a result, we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multi-award contracts. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition, financial resources and larger technical staffs and with smaller, more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas. Additionally, we may compete with the U.S. government\u2019s own capabilities.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by both evolving customer needs and rapidly changing technology. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and solutions that address these changing needs and to provide the people and technology needed to deliver these services and solutions. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service, technology and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers. Our competitors may be able to provide customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide. They may have better technical qualifications, past contract experience, geographic presence, pricing power and qualified professional personnel. In addition, our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties which increases their ability to address customers\u2019 needs in a manner that we cannot duplicate. In recent years, certain U.S. government officials have encouraged large, sophisticated commercial technology companies to enter the U.S. government services market. Accordingly, we anticipate that larger or new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge which may adversely affect our ability to compete for new contracts.\nA failure to attract, train, retain and utilize skilled employees and our senior management team would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations.\nOur business relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Our continued success depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled engineering, technical and professional personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees. In addition, many U.S. government programs require contractors to have security clearances. Depending on the level of required clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand. Particularly in highly specialized areas, it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner, which may affect our growth in the current and future fiscal years. Although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to attract, effectively train and retain these employees. Any failure to do so could impair our ability to efficiently perform our contractual obligations, timely meet our customers\u2019 needs and ultimately win new business, all of which could adversely affect our future results.\nSalaries and related costs are a significant portion of the cost of providing our services and, accordingly, our ability to efficiently utilize our workforce impacts our profitability. If our employees are under-utilized, our profitability could suffer. The degree to which we are able to utilize our employees in a timely manner or at all is affected by a number of factors including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments, forecast demand for our services in order to maintain and deploy headcount that is aligned with demand, and our need to devote resources to training, business development, and other non-contract related activities. Additionally, if our employees are over-utilized, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and retention, which could, in turn, have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe that our success also depends on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and that team\u2019s ability to retain existing business and generate new business. Our senior management team is important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of retaining and obtaining customer contracts in our industry. Moreover, there is little redundancy or overlap of responsibilities in our corporate functions and loss of key personnel in critical functions could lead to lack of business continuity or disruptions in our operations, financial reporting or control processes until we are able to hire and train replacement personnel.\nWithin the past year, we completed a significant acquisition and may make other acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and divestitures in the future that involve numerous risks, which if realized, may adversely affect our business and our future results.\nIn May 2015, we acquired Scitor Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Scitor) for a total purchase price of $764 million, net of cash acquired. In connection with the acquisition, we amended our Credit Facility to incur approximately $670 million of additional debt and converted the Credit Facility from an unsecured facility to a facility secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we are required to maintain a certain ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (referred to as the Leverage Ratio). Further, under the terms of the Credit Facility, we are limited in our ability to pay dividends beyond our current regular dividend and repurchase shares of our stock above a certain Leverage Ratio, are required to make certain mandatory prepayments based on the cash flow of our business, and are subject to other operational limitations.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nOur Credit Facility also imposes limitations on our ability to make other acquisitions. Subject to those limitations, we may selectively pursue additional strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures. The Scitor acquisition and other acquisitions, investments and joint ventures pose many risks that could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial results, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may not retain key employees (including those with needed security clearances), customers and business partners of Scitor or those of an acquired business in the future;\n\u00b7\nwe may fail to successfully integrate Scitor or other future acquired businesses, such as failing to successfully implement IT and other control systems relating to the operations of Scitor or any other future acquired business;\n\u00b7\nwe may not generate sufficient earnings to meet the required Leverage Ratio under the Credit Facility, which would give lenders the right to, among other things, foreclose on our assets;\n\u00b7\neven if successful, the Scitor acquisition and any future acquisition could reduce our earnings per share or net income for a number of reasons, including the amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges, the inability to generate or sustain profits of the acquired business, adverse changes in unhedged interest rates on debt incurred to complete the acquisition or a failure to realize assumed future tax benefits estimated in connection with the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions normally require a significant investment of time and resources, which may disrupt our business and distract our management from other important responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nthe limitations on our ability to issue dividends beyond our current regular dividend and to repurchase our stock under the Credit Facility above a certain Leverage Ratio may restrict our capital deployment decisions in the future, which may have an adverse impact on our stock price;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of the Scitor acquisition or any future acquisitions and investments on our business and we may not realize anticipated revenue opportunities, cost savings, or other synergies or benefits, or acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\n\u00b7\nwe may assume known as well as unknown material liabilities that were not identified as part of our due diligence or for which we are unable to receive a purchase price adjustment or reimbursement through indemnification;\n\u00b7\nwe may assume legal or regulatory risks, particularly with respect to businesses that have immature business processes and compliance programs or that operate in markets in which we have previously had limited direct prior experience;\n\u00b7\nwe may be adversely impacted by developments in the U.S. government intelligence community budgets and other areas to which we had limited exposure prior to the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nwe may encounter performance problems with acquired technologies, capabilities and products, particularly with respect to those that are still in development when acquired;\n\u00b7\nacquired entities or joint ventures may not operate profitably, which could adversely affect our operating income or operating margins and we may be unable to recover investments in any such acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions, investments and joint ventures may require us to spend a significant amount of cash and incur a substantial amount of debt, with increased interest expense and amortization demands and mandatory prepayment requirements, or to issue capital stock, resulting in dilution of ownership; and\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to effectively influence the operations of our joint ventures or we may be exposed to certain liabilities if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations or fail to comply with legal requirements, laws and regulations.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nIf the Scitor acquisition or any other acquisitions, investments or joint ventures fail, perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason, including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions, our business and financial results would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may periodically divest businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification, guarantee or other financial arrangements, for a period of time following the transaction, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may not realize as revenues the entire amounts reflected in our backlog, which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects.\nAs of January 29, 2016, our total backlog was $7.2 billion, which included $1.9 billion in funded backlog. Due to the U.S. government\u2019s ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate, modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our non-U.S. government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances, we may realize less than expected or, in some cases, never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog. Our unfunded backlog, in particular, contains management\u2019s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues. If we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog, our expected future revenues, growth prospects and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs, time and resources.\nWe generate revenues under various types of contracts, which include cost-reimbursement, T&M and FFP contracts. Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or solutions provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost-reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profitability than FFP contracts.\nTo varying degrees, each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract. Our profitability is adversely affected when we incur costs on cost-reimbursement and T&M contracts that we cannot bill to our customers. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. Revenues derived from FFP contracts represented approximately 32% of our total revenues for fiscal 2016. When making proposals on FFP contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the associated projects, as well as assumptions regarding technical issues. In each case, our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during the performance of work could result, and in some instances has resulted, in reduced profits or in losses. More generally, any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of our contracts, including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control (such as performance failures of our subcontractors, natural disasters or other force majeure events) could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable.\nWe use estimates in recognizing revenues and, if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our contract revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. This method requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. Particularly due to the technical nature of the services being performed and the length of certain contracts, this estimation process is complex and involves significant judgment. Adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized immediately. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect future financial results.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nOur business and financial results could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats.\nAs a U.S. government contractor and a provider of IT services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies, we handle sensitive information which includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, personnel information, classified information, financial information and other confidential information concerning our business and employees and those of our customers (collectively referred to below as sensitive information). We are continuously exposed to cyber and other security threats, including computer viruses, attacks by hackers or physical break-ins. Any electronic or physical break-in or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of sensitive or other information stored or transmitted through our IT systems and networks. This could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems are becoming more sophisticated. These attempts include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others, and may be perpetrated by well-funded organized crime or state sponsored efforts. We seek to detect and investigate all security events and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. We continue to improve our threat protection, detection and mitigation policies, procedures and controls.\nIn addition, we work with other companies in the industry and government participants to share threat intelligence and promote increased awareness and enhanced protections against cybersecurity threats. However, because of the evolving nature of these security threats, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls have or will detect or prevent any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such incident. We may experience similar security threats to the IT systems that we develop, install or maintain under customer contracts, including customer contracts under which we may have access to or management responsibility for customer databases or networks that contain sensitive information relating to our customers, their employees or related third parties. Although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber and other security threats, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities.\nIn the event of unauthorized access to sensitive information that we are responsible for safeguarding, our customers and their employees or related third parties, if applicable, may seek to hold us liable for any costs or other damages associated with the unauthorized access as a breach of our contractual and other obligations. In addition, various federal or state agencies may bring legal action against us for violation of or noncompliance with regulatory requirements relating to any unauthorized access to sensitive information within our control. Any remediation costs, damages or other liabilities related to unauthorized access of sensitive information of ours or our customers caused by cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any unauthorized access caused by these security threats could adversely affect our reputation, ability to work on sensitive U.S. government contracts, business operations and financial results.\nInternal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and solutions to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAny internal disruption or failure in our IT network, software or hardware systems, communications equipment, utilities or other business equipment or services could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide the services required to be performed by us under customer contracts or bill our customers for work performed, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. We are also vulnerable to failures in these systems, equipment and other business services caused by third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks or other events, which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption. As a result, any internal or external disruption or failure in our IT network, software or hardware systems, communications equipment, utilities or other business equipment or services could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nCustomer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nMany of the systems and networks that we develop, install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. While we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions, if a system or network that we develop, install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats or other events, we may experience loss of revenue, remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination. Any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected.\nLegal disputes could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend, which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability, and could damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims described under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I of this report. We are also subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of other litigation or claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. The Department of Justice and other enforcement agencies of the U.S. government may bring claims or lawsuits against us in connection with our performance of government contracts or our billing or record-keeping relating to those contracts. The Department of Justice has considerably more resources at its disposal than we do, and can bring suspension and debarment proceedings against us that would prevent us from working for some or all U.S. government customers. In addition, certain statutes under which the Department of Justice may bring claims (like the False Claims Act) provide for treble damages and penalties on a per invoice basis against government contractors. These circumstances generally give the Department of Justice significantly more leverage in any legal dispute with us than if we were defending ourselves against claims brought by a commercial enterprise. Adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation could be costly to defend, and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Litigation and other claims, including those described under \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I of this report, are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements or any misconduct by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could harm our business and reputation.\nIn addition to government contract procurement laws and regulations, we are subject to numerous other federal, state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption, import/export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. Compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nMisconduct by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could harm our business. Such misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records, failure to comply with our policies and procedures or violations of applicable laws and regulations. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities, our precautions may not prevent all misconduct and, as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. Misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business and our future results.\nOur reputation may be harmed or other adverse consequences may be incurred by us relating to former Parent\u2019s CityTime contract, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects.\nIn connection with the resolution of certain investigations related to former Parent\u2019s CityTime contract, former Parent entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York and an administrative agreement with the Army on behalf of the U.S. government to confirm former Parent\u2019s continuing eligibility to enter into and perform contracts with the U.S. government. While both of these agreements have terminated, given that we have retained the name Science Applications International Corporation, which was the name of the company that was the prime contractor under the CityTime contract, we may suffer reputational harm as a result of being associated with the contract as well as with former Parent\u2019s deferred prosecution agreement and administrative agreement. This could make it more difficult to compete effectively and may adversely affect our future revenues and growth prospects.\nGoodwill and intangible assets represent a significant amount of our total assets and any impairment of these assets would negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn May 2015 we completed the acquisition of Scitor Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries for purchase consideration of $764 million. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets have increased significantly following completion of this acquisition. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results.\nWe depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors. If we are not able to maintain these relationships, or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer, our revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services, products and solutions provided by us and our teammates will help us to win and perform the contract. Our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us, or if the U.S. government terminates or reduces these other contractors\u2019 programs, does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract. Companies that do not have access to U.S. government contracts or experience with our customers may perform services as our subcontractor that we cannot otherwise provide ourselves, and that exposure could enhance such companies\u2019 prospect of securing a future position as a prime U.S. government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to win these contracts.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nFrom time to time, we have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of a subcontractor\u2019s personnel or the subcontractor\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law. Any financial stress of our subcontractors could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations, have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized. In addition, we have certain obligations to our former Parent to permit it to perform up to one hundred percent (100%) of task orders as a subcontractor to us under certain contracts that were novated to us in the spin-off transaction. Subcontractor performance deficiencies under subcontracts with us as the prime contractor, including performance by our former Parent, could lead to significant losses in future periods and could result in our termination for default as the prime contractor even though it was the subcontractor that failed to perform and not our personnel. A termination for default could eliminate a revenue source, expose us to liability, hurt our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders, especially if the customer is an agency of the U.S. government.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. We may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. If we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected. In addition, in connection with the performance of services, the U.S. government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under government-funded contracts and subcontracts, which may permit the U.S. government to disclose or license this information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us or our customers. Our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and solutions we provide. The expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur insurance may be insufficient to protect us from claims or losses.\nWe maintain insurance coverage with third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. However, not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance, and, for those risks we insure, the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred. If any of our third-party insurers fail, cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations could be disrupted. Our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant warranty and other liability claims or losses. Moreover, there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. If liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage, our business and prospects may be harmed. Regardless of the adequacy of our insurance coverage, any significant claim could have an adverse impact on our market reputation, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nWe could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our detection systems fail to operate as intended or our assessment reports prove to be inaccurate.\nWe have developed and sold tsunami buoys and related services that are designed to assist in the detection of tsunamis or large waves that may have catastrophic consequences to coastal communities. Our buoys have been deployed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and non-U.S. governments in other areas around the world. There are many factors, some of which are beyond our control, which could result in the failure of these buoys. We may develop other products or provide services for the detection of natural or manmade threats that could have catastrophic consequences if the threats are realized. In addition, we prepare reports for various government customers in the evaluation or assessment of the consequences of certain threats or natural disasters. The failure of our products and services to help detect the threats for which they were designed or the failure of our reports to accurately assess the consequences of certain threats could contribute to injury, death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability, professional liability, or other claims against us. Further, if our products, services or reports fail to, or are perceived to have failed to help detect or adequately assess a threat, the negative publicity from such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur services and operations sometimes involve using, handling or disposing of hazardous substances or dangerous materials, which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.\nSome of our services and operations involve the use, handling or disposal of hazardous substances or dangerous materials, including explosive, chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials. These activities generally subject us to extensive foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, which, among other things, require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances or dangerous materials. Furthermore, failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanctions, including fines, penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government or could cause us to incur costs to change, upgrade, remediate and/or close some of our operations or properties. Although we do not have extensive real estate holdings, our ownership and operation of real property also subjects us to environmental protection laws, some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases. If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to, these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nOur international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our U.S. business. Failure to comply with U.S. government laws and regulations applicable to international business such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. export control regulations could have an adverse impact on our business with the U.S. government and could expose us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties and may expose us to potentially significant contract losses. In addition, we provide services and solutions in support of U.S. government customers in countries with governments that may be or may become unstable or are in areas of active military or intelligence operations. Operating in such environments may increase the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life, or damage or destruction of property, or inability to meet our contractual obligations. Although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues, we do not know the impact that these regulatory, geopolitical and other factors may have on our business in the future and any of these factors could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to our Stock\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. These restrictions, which may also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors not endorsed by our current directors and management, include the following:\n\u2022\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may be amended by only two-thirds or more voting power of all of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. These supermajority voting requirements could impede our stockholders\u2019 ability to make changes to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\n\u2022\nOur certificate of incorporation contains certain supermajority voting provisions, which generally provide that mergers and certain other business combinations between a related person and us be approved by the holders of securities having at least 80% of our outstanding voting power, as well as by the holders of a majority of the voting power of such securities that are not owned by the related person.\n\u2022\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our stock are limited in their ability to take certain actions other than in connection with the annual stockholders\u2019 meeting or a special meeting called at the request of qualified stockholders as provided in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\n\u2022\nOur Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain restrictions on business combinations. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years, or among other things, our Board of Directors has approved the business combination or the transaction pursuant to which such person became a 15% holder prior to the time the person became a 15% holder.\nSCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\nWe have contracts with the U.S. government that are classified which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the U.S. government that are subject to security restrictions (classified programs), which preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes. We are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other programs and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business.\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our stock in the future.\nThe Board of Directors authorized and declared a quarterly cash dividend for each of the quarters since the spin-off from former Parent. The declaration of any future dividends and the establishment of the per share amount, record dates and payment dates for any future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors taking into account future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will declare any dividends in the future. In addition, our ability to declare and pay any future dividends may be restricted by the provisions of Delaware law and covenants in our Credit Facility. To the extent that expectations by market participants regarding the potential payment, or amount, of any dividend prove to be incorrect, the price of our common stock may be materially and negatively affected and investors that bought shares of our common stock based on those expectations may suffer a loss on their investment.\nForward-Looking Statement Risks\nYou may not be able to rely on forward-looking statements.\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management\u2019s belief and assumptions about the future in light of information currently available to our management. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d and similar words or phrases or the negative of these words or phrases. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those results anticipated by our forward-looking statements, which include, but are not limited to the risk factors discussed above.\nWe do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements or to conform these statements to actual results.", "PERMNO": 14141, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "SAIC"}
