{"cik": "1591877", "company": "Sizmek Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when considering an investment in our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into the following groups:\n\u00b7\nrisks related to our industry and the markets we serve,\n\u00b7\nrisks related specifically to our business and operations,\n\u00b7\nrisks related to our capital structure,\n\u00b7\nrisks concerning law, regulation and policy that affect our business, and\n\u00b7\nrisks related to our spin-off from DG.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and the Markets We Serve\nThe industry is in a state of rapid technological change and we may not be able to keep up with that pace.\nThe advertisement distribution and management industry is characterized by extremely rapid technological change, frequent new products and service introductions and evolving industry standards, and the online advertising industry has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history. The introduction of products with new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services, develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.\nAccordingly, you must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we will encounter in this new and rapidly evolving market. If we cannot, for technological or other reasons, enhance our existing products and services and develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions, industry standards or other customer requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nSeasonality makes forecasting difficult and can result in widely fluctuating quarterly results.\nHistorically, the industry has experienced the lowest sales in the first quarter and the highest sales in the fourth quarter, with the second quarter being slightly stronger than the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales tend to be the highest due to increased customer advertising volumes for the holiday selling season. In addition, product and service revenues are influenced by political advertising, which generally occurs every two years. We also have historically operated with little or no backlog, which, along with seasonality, increases the difficulty of predicting our operating results.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and competition may increase further as new participants enter the market and more established companies with greater resources seek to expand their market share.\nCompetition within the markets for media distribution is intense. We face formidable competition from other companies that provide solutions and services similar to ours. Currently, our primary competitors are DoubleClick (a subsidiary of Google), Atlas (a subsidiary of Facebook) and MediaPlex (a division of ValueClick). Atlas offers solutions and services similar to ours and competes directly with us. We expect that Atlas will have the benefit of substantial financial resources, though it is unclear whether such resources will be focused on agency side campaign management products and capabilities to support the needs of advertisers wanting to advertise across multiple publishers, which would increase its ability to compete with us.\nThere are other platform companies and demand side platform companies that offer advertisement services that could potentially expand their capabilities to include rich media, online video, verification and viewability in competition with us. Other competitors exist in niches in which we operate, such as rich media, online video, verification, viewability and social media.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully with all of our service offerings depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control, including: (i) the price, quality and performance of our products and those of our competitors; (ii) the timing and success of new product introductions; (iii) the emergence of new technologies; (iv) the number and nature of our competitors in a given market; (v) the protection of our intellectual property rights; and (vi) general market and economic conditions. In addition, the assertion of intellectual property rights by others may factor into our ability to compete successfully. The competitive environment could result in price reductions that could result in lower profits and loss of our market share.\nIn addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, and several of our competitors have combined or may combine in the future with larger companies with greater resources than ours. This growing trend of cooperative relationships and consolidation within our industry may create a great number of powerful and aggressive competitors that may engage in more extensive research and development, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and/or make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees and customers than we are able to. They may also adopt more aggressive pricing policies and may even provide services similar to ours at no additional cost by bundling them with their other product and service offerings. Any increase in the level of competition from these, or any other competitors, is likely to result in price reductions, reduced margins, loss of market share and a potential decline in our revenues. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. If we fail to withstand competitive pressures and compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nConsolidation of Internet advertising networks, web portals, Internet search engine sites and web publishers may impair our ability to serve advertisements and to collect campaign data and could lead to a loss of significant online customers.\nThe growing trend of consolidation of Internet advertising networks, web portals, Internet search engine sites and web publishers, and increasing industry presence of a small number of large companies, such as Google, Facebook and, most recently, Apple, with the announcement of its iAd platform for placing ads on Apple's applications, could harm our business. We are currently able to serve, track and manage advertisements for our customers on a variety of networks and websites. Concentration of advertising networks could substantially impair our ability to serve advertisements if these networks or websites decide not to permit us to serve, track or manage advertisements on their websites, if they develop ad placement systems that are incompatible with our ad serving systems or if they use their market power to force their customers to use certain vendors on their networks or websites. These networks or websites could also prohibit or limit our aggregation of advertising campaign data if they use technology that is not compatible with our technology. In addition, concentration of desirable advertising space in a small number of networks and websites could result in competitive pricing pressures and diminish the value of our advertising campaign databases, as the value of these databases depends to some degree on the continuous aggregation of data from advertising campaigns on a variety of different advertising networks and websites. Additionally, major publishers could terminate our ability to serve advertisements on their properties on short notice. If we are no longer able to serve, track and manage advertisements on a variety of networks and websites, our ability to service campaigns effectively and aggregate useful campaign data for our customers would be limited, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInternet security poses risks to our entire business.\nThe process of e-commerce aggregation by means of our hardware and software infrastructure involves the transmission and analysis of confidential and proprietary information of the advertiser, as well as our own confidential and proprietary information. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from other companies to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure Internet transmission of confidential information, such as credit and other proprietary information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect client transaction data. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause material interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to minimize problems caused by security breaches. To the extent that our activities or the activities of others involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may not prevent security breaches. Our failure to prevent these security breaches could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in the future.\nIn each of the last five years we have reported net losses, and we cannot guarantee that we will become profitable in the future. Even if we achieve profitability, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business, including our ability to raise additional funds.\nOur new MDX-NXT platform, which is in development, may not be available for general use as intended and may not operate as planned.\nWe are in the process of developing a new platform called the Sizmek MDX-NXT platform which is intended to replace our existing platform. Development of the MDX-NXT platform is ongoing and certain portions of the platform are operating currently. We expect the development to be substantially complete by the middle of 2016 at which time we will begin the transition of our customer traffic over to the new platform.\nThe development and implementation of a new platform is a large and complex undertaking. Substantial risks remain that the new platform will not operate as intended or may not be available for general use by the middle of 2016 as planned. Further, we may experience multiple computer bugs, service interruptions and unplanned downtime while developing and implementing the MDX NXT platform. If the new platform does not operate as intended it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business may be harmed if we are not able to protect our intellectual property rights from third-party challenges or if the intellectual property we use or business operations in which we engage infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe consider our patents, trademarks, copyrights, advertising and promotion design to be of value and important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other arrangements to protect our proprietary rights, and we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our distributors and customers and limit access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. These steps taken to protect our proprietary information may not prevent misappropriation of such information, and may not preclude competitors from developing confusingly similar brand names or promotional materials or developing products and services similar to ours. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries where our products are utilized do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. A failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe technology services sector within advertising and marketing contains a large and ever growing number of new and existing technology providers with potentially overlapping intellectual property claims. We cannot assure you that our intellectual property or business operations do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, and in the future, third parties could allege that we infringe on their proprietary rights. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation and diversion of management attention. If such claims are successful, we may not be able to obtain licenses necessary for the operation of our business, or, if obtainable, such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, either of which could prevent our ability to operate our business. Thus, any such claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on key personnel to manage the business effectively, and if we are unable to retain our key employees or hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nOur future success will depend, to a significant extent, upon the services of our executive team. Uncontrollable circumstances, such as the death or incapacity of any key executive officer, could have a serious impact on our business. Our future success will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, operations, information technology and marketing personnel. There is, and will continue to be, intense competition for personnel with experience in the markets applicable to our products and services. The inability to retain our key employees or to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSystem disruptions and security threats to our computer networks or phone systems could harm our business.\nThe performance and reliability of our computer network and phone systems infrastructure is critical to our operations. Any computer system error or failure, regardless of cause, could result in a substantial outage that materially disrupts our operations. In addition, we face threats to our computer systems from unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. We devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but our computer systems may still be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur use of \"open source\" software could subject our technology to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, or subject us to litigation, which could harm our business.\nOur technology incorporates or is distributed with software or data licensed from third parties, including some software that incorporates so-called \"open source\" software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use, and that we offer our services that incorporate the open source software for no cost. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners. We attempt to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to our software, but such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our solutions. In the future, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering some of our solutions, and these licenses may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Alternatively, we may be forced to re-engineer some of our solutions or discontinue use of portions of the functionality provided by our solutions. In addition, the terms of open source licenses may require us to provide our solutions that use open source software to others on unfavorable terms. If a third party that distributes open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contain the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDefects or errors in our solutions or failure to detect click-through fraud or other invalid clicks may impair our customers' ability to deliver against their advertising campaign goals, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe technology underlying our solutions, including our own proprietary technology and third-party technology provided by our vendors, may contain material defects or errors that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and cause significant harm to our reputation. These defects or errors, or other disruptions in service or other performance problems in our solutions, could result in the incomplete or inaccurate delivery of advertisements, including the inability of an advertisement format to render within a specific placement, in the wrong geographical location or in a context that the advertiser finds inappropriate or otherwise undesirable for its brand. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks and other invalid clicks on advertisements delivered by us from a variety of potential sources. Invalid clicks are clicks that are not intended by the user to link to the underlying content, or when a software program, known as a bot, spider, or crawler, intentionally simulates user activity causing impressions, ad engagements or clicks to be counted as real users.\nIf we experience any of the defects, errors or other problems described above, our business, brand and reputation could suffer and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new business could be harmed. If fraudulent clicks are not detected, the data that our solutions provide to our customers will be inaccurate and the affected advertisers may lose confidence in our solutions to deliver a return on their investment. In addition, customers whose advertisements were placed in an incomplete or inaccurate manner or undesirable context could refuse to pay for such advertisements, demand refunds or future credits or initiate litigation against us. Our advertisers could become dissatisfied with our solutions and may choose to do business with our competitors or reduce their spending on Internet advertising. Any of the consequences described above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew advertisement blocking technologies could limit or block the delivery or display of advertisements by our solutions, which could undermine the viability of our business.\nAdvertisement blocking technologies, such as \"filter\" software programs, that can limit or block the delivery or display of advertisements delivered through our solutions are currently available for Internet users and are continuing to be developed. If these technologies become widespread, the commercial viability of the current Internet advertisement model may be undermined. As a result, ad-blocking technology could, in the future, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMore individuals are using non-personal computer devices to access the Internet, and browser companies may change some of their underlying functionality. Our solutions developed for these devices and browsers may not be widely deployed.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers (\"PCs\"), including mobile devices, game consoles and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. Many of these devices do not accept the cookies we currently use to target audiences and measure campaign performance and require a new approach. If we are unable to deliver our solutions and services to a substantial number of alternative device users or if we are slow to develop solutions and technologies that are more compatible with non-PC communications devices, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, some of the more popular browsers in use today have indicated that in the future, they may not accept or support the cookies we currently use to target audiences and measure campaign performance. Furthermore, the ability to provide attribution, tracking a user's activity through multiple ad, search, or site interactions across multiple devices, requires the development of a single Cross Device ID. If we are unable to develop or license this type of technology, our services may be insufficient to meet the needs of our customers in the future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProblems with content delivery services, bandwidth providers, data centers or other third parties could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business relies significantly on third-party vendors, such as content delivery services, bandwidth providers and data centers. We have entered into an agreements with providers of content delivery services to assist us in serving advertisements. If our content delivery service providers, or other third-party vendors, fail to provide their services or if their services are no longer available to us for any reason and we are not immediately able to find replacement providers, our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, any disruption in network access or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business operations. If our service is disrupted, we may lose revenues directly related to the impressions that we failed to serve and we may be obligated to compensate clients for their loss. Our reputation may also suffer in the event of a disruption. Any financial or other difficulties our providers face may negatively impact our business, and we are unable to predict the nature and extent of any such impact. We exercise very little control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We license technologies from third-parties to facilitate aspects of our data center and connectivity operations including, among others, Internet traffic management services. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for such elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services could negatively impact our customer relationships and adversely affect our brand reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and expose us to liabilities to third parties.\nOur data centers are vulnerable to natural disasters, terrorism and system failures that could significantly harm our business operations and lead to client dissatisfaction.\nIn delivering our solutions, we are dependent on the operation of our data centers, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, war, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our system, and similar events. In particular, two of our data centers, in Tokyo, Japan and Los Angeles, California, are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes and others are located in areas with a high risk of terrorist attacks, such as New York City, New York. Our insurance policies have limited coverage in such cases and may not fully compensate us for any loss. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a provider's decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Any damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service could reduce our revenues and profits, and our brand reputation could be damaged if customers believe our system is unreliable, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may enter into, or seek to enter into, business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, expose us to unanticipated liabilities, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nWe have a history of completing business acquisitions. Over the last three calendar years, we have completed five acquisitions, and we may make business acquisitions in the future. Any such acquisitions would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in such acquisitions, including:\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u00b7\nthe potential disruption of our business;\n\u00b7\nthe inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our product and service offerings;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated liabilities associated with an acquisition including (i) technology, intellectual property and infringement issues, (ii) employment, retirement or severance related claims, and (iii) claims by or amounts owed to vendors or customers;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, with respect to accounting matters and otherwise;\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired companies; and\n\u00b7\nthe impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management and operational structure.\nAny acquired businesses and product lines may not be successfully integrated with our operations, personnel or technologies. Any inability to successfully integrate the operations, personnel and technologies associated with an acquired business and/or product line may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating internationally.\nInternational operations are important to our future operations, growth and prospects. We have operations in numerous foreign countries and may continue to expand our operations internationally. Our international operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which services are provided. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions, and can change significantly over time. In order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or marketing arrangements with local operators, partners or agents. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products. Some of the risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:\n\u00b7\nchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles in some countries;\n\u00b7\nlegal and regulatory restrictions;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nchallenges to our transfer pricing arrangements;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability and export restrictions;\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7\nhigher costs associated with doing business internationally.\nAny one or more of these factors could negatively impact our international operations and thus adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to our location in Israel and conditions in Israel could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and challenges that specifically relate to our Israeli operations. The majority of our research and development activities and a large portion of our accounting functions are performed in Herzliya, Israel. In total, about 22% of our workforce is located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel could directly affect our business. Since the State of Israel was established in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Several countries, principally in the Middle East, restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell our products to companies in these countries. Any hostilities involving Israel, acts of terrorism, or significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel, could adversely affect our operations, accounting functions and research and development activities and cause our revenues to decrease.\nIn addition, our business insurance may not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Israeli operations may be disrupted by the obligations of personnel to perform military service.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 264 employees based in Israel. Our employees in Israel may be called upon to perform up to 36 days (and in some cases more) of annual military reserve duty until they reach the age of 45 (and in some cases, up to 49), and in emergency circumstances, could be called to active duty. In response to increased tension and hostilities, since September 2000 there have been occasional call-ups of military reservists, and it is possible that there will be additional call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of our employees related to military service or the absence for extended periods of one or more of our key employees for military service. Such disruption could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMarket conditions or weak financial performance in our operations may make it difficult to obtain financing needed to make acquisitions necessary to grow our business or protect our existing lines of business.\nWe have grown primarily through acquisition over the past several years. If we are unable to find sources of capital on favorable terms due to market conditions or weak financial performance in our operations, we may lose opportunities to expand our business through additional acquisitions, or to protect against erosion of revenue and margins in our existing businesses. If our stock price becomes too weak or depressed, we could have difficulty using our stock as currency in acquisitions, or be forced to enter into dilutive transactions using our stock to consummate acquisitions necessary to our business strategy.\nRisks Related to our Capital Structure\nA portion of our assets is reflected as goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet, which may be subject to further impairment should our market capitalization fall substantially below the book value of our shareholders' equity or our actual or expected future cash flows fall sufficiently below our forecasts.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets were created in the acquisitions we completed over the past several years. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in future periods, and/or our market capitalization declines sufficiently relative to the value at and around December 31, 2015, we may be required to take another goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charge that would result in a reduction to our operating results in the period in which we take the charge.\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights and preferences superior to those applicable to our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision for the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, with each series containing such rights and preferences as the board of directors may determine from time to time, without prior notice to, or approval of, stockholders. Among others, such rights and preferences might include the rights to dividends, superior voting rights, liquidation preferences and rights to convert into common stock. The rights and preferences of any such series of preferred stock, if issued, may be superior to the rights and preferences applicable to our common stock and might result in a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Law, Regulation and Policy Affecting our Business\nUncertainty regarding a variety of United States and foreign laws may expose us to liability and adversely affect our ability to offer our solutions and services.\nThe laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their customers and users are currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Claims have been threatened and filed under both United States and foreign law for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy and other claims, including for data protection violations, tort, unlawful activity, copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the advertisements posted or the content generated by our customers. From time to time, we have received notices from individuals who do not want to be exposed to advertisements delivered by us on behalf of our customers. If one of these complaints results in liability to us, it could be costly, encourage similar lawsuits, distract management and harm our reputation and possibly our business.\nThere is also uncertainty regarding the application to us of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain advertisers' businesses, including, for example, distribution of pharmaceuticals, adult content, financial services, alcohol, marijuana or firearms. Existing or new legislation could expose us to substantial liability, restrict our ability to deliver services to our customers and post ads for various industries, limit our ability to grow and cause us to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations.\nFurthermore, it has been reported in the press that both the United States and some regional regulatory bodies, including in the EU and Brazil, are considering material and far reaching changes to regulations governing user tracking, measurement and profiling, as well as the definitions of Personally Identifiable Information. Such regulatory changes could have the effect of causing us to spend significantly more money to segregate data elements, to exit the measurement, tracking, and optimization business in specific regions, or even block us entirely from providing services in specific regions.\nAny of the items described above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrivacy concerns could lead to legislative and other limitations on our ability to collect or process user level data from Internet users, including limitations on our use of various tracking technologies such as cookies or conversion tags and user profiling, which are crucial to our ability to provide our solutions and services to our customers.\nOur ability to conduct targeted advertising campaigns and compile data that we use to execute campaign strategies for our customers depends, in part, on the use of \"cookies,\" \"conversion tags\" and other tracking technologies to track users, their devices and their online behavior, which allows us to create user profiles to deliver more relevant advertisements to users and to measure an advertising campaign's effectiveness. A cookie is a small file of information stored on a user's computer that allows us to recognize that user's browser when we serve advertisements. Our conversion tags are pieces of code placed on specific pages of websites that record a specific action such as the completion of an online form or the viewing on an ecommerce website. As a general matter we do not collect personally identifiable information on users other than cookie IDs and IP addresses, which we use anonymously and do not associate with other personally identifiable information. Occasionally at the request and on behalf of a customer, Sizmek may collect personal information supplied voluntarily by consumers through their interaction with data collection fields in the body of advertisements or on websites (such as name, email, etc.). This personal information is provided directly to the customer on whose behalf the information was collected, or the customer's service providers, and is processed by us only to the extent and as long as is necessary to provide the advertising services for which the personal information was collected. In certain services requested by our clients, our platform may utilize IP addresses for geo-targeting, click-fraud detection and for use in analytics. In terms of data retention, logs with raw user data are saved for 13 months as required by Interactive Advertising Bureau policy.\nGovernment authorities inside the United States concerned with the privacy of Internet users have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies, conversion tags or user profiling. Bills aimed at regulating the collection and use of personal data from Internet users are currently pending in U.S. Congress and many state legislatures. Attempts to regulate spyware may be drafted in such a way as to include technology, like cookies and conversion tags, in the definition of spyware, thereby creating restrictions on our ability to use them. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce have conducted hearings regarding user profiling, the collection of non-personally identifiable information and online privacy.\nOur foreign operations may also be adversely affected by regulatory action outside the United States. For example, the European Union has adopted a directive addressing data privacy that limits the collection, disclosure and use of information regarding European Internet users. In addition, the European Union has enacted an electronic communications directive that imposes certain restrictions on the use of cookies and conversion tags and also places restrictions on the sending of unsolicited communications.\nInternet users may also directly limit or eliminate the placement of cookies on their computers by using third party software that blocks cookies, or by disabling or restricting the cookie functions of their Internet browser software. Internet browser software upgrades may also result in limitations on the use of cookies or conversion tags. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 11 browser has the Do Not Track signal turned on by default and Firefox has publicly talked about turning on the 3rd party cookie blocking feature by default, in both cases impacting our ability to deliver and measure more targeted advertising. Technologies like the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project may limit collection of cookie and conversion tag information. The owners of mobile device operating systems place significant restrictions on the use of tracking technologies as well as privacy-enabling technologies, such as our opt-out cookie. Controls by the mobile device operating system owners could limit or eliminate our ability to collect Internet user information. Individuals have also brought class action suits against companies related to the use of cookies and several companies, including companies in the Internet advertising industry, have had claims brought against them before the Federal Trade Commission regarding the collection and use of Internet user information. We may be subject to such suits in the future, which could limit or eliminate our ability to collect such information.\nIf our ability to use tracking technologies such as cookies or conversion tags or to build user profiles is substantially restricted due to the foregoing, or for any other reason, we would have to generate and use other technology or methods that allow the gathering of user profile data in order to provide our services to our customers. This change in technology or methods could require significant reengineering time and resources, and may not be complete in time to avoid negative consequences to our business. In addition, alternative technology or methods might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If the use of tracking technologies such as cookies and conversion tags are prohibited and we are not able to efficiently and cost effectively create new technology, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, any compromise of our security that results in the release of Internet users' and/or our customers' data could seriously limit the adoption of our solutions and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand, expose us to liability and subject us to reporting obligations under various federal and state laws, which could have an adverse effect on our business. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase, as the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers (including personal information) and the number of countries where we operate increases, and we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny perception of our practices or products as an invasion of privacy, whether or not such practices or products are consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability.\nTo the extent that we collect and store information derived from the activities of website visitors and their devices on behalf of particular clients, our compliance with privacy laws, regulations and industry codes and our reputation among the public body of website visitors depend in part on our clients' adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with visitors' expectations. We contractually require our website publisher clients to notify visitors to their websites about our services (i.e., that we place cookies and collect and share certain non-identifying data for purposes of targeting advertisements), and further require that they link to pages where visitors can opt-out of the collection or targeting. We rely on representations made to us by clients that they will comply with all applicable laws including all relevant privacy and data protection regulations. We make reasonable efforts to enforce contractual notice requirements but do not fully audit our clients' compliance with our recommended disclosures or their adherence to privacy laws and regulations, nor do we contractually require them to seek explicit consent to the placement of cookies which may be required in certain countries. If our clients fail to adhere to our contracts in this regard, or a court or governmental agency determines that we have not adequately, accurately or completely contractually required our clients to do so, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may be required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions in the future, which may decrease sales, and we may be subject to liability for sales and use taxes and related interest and penalties on prior sales.\nA successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services, or that we have failed to do so where required in the past, could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and decrease our ability to compete for future sales. Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we presently believe sales and use taxes are not due. We reserve estimated sales and use taxes in our financial statements but we cannot be certain that we have made sufficient reserves to cover all taxes that might be assessed.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nWe are responsible for all pre-closing liabilities and contingencies of DG.\nBecause DG contributed all of its cash and substantially all of its working capital to us as part of the Spin-Off, we have assumed and are responsible for all pre-closing liabilities and any loss contingencies of DG and its television business prior to the Merger of DG with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Extreme Reach. Under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements entered into in connection with the Spin-Off, we have agreed to indemnify DG and its affiliates (including Extreme Reach following the Merger) from all such liabilities and loss contingencies.", "PERMNO": 83131, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SZMK"}
