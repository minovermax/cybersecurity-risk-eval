RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks described below, with all of the other information we include in this report, and the additional information in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\" or the \"Commission\"). These risks may result in material harm to our business, our financial condition, and results of our operations. In this eventuality, the market price of our common stock may decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nWe are dependent on the commercial success of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR.\nOur financial performance, including our ability to replace revenue and income lost to generic and other competition as well as to grow our business, depends heavily on the commercial success of our products. A substantial amount of our resources are focused on maintaining and/or expanding the revenue generated by our approved products in the U.S., Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR. If any of our major products were to become subject to problems, such as changes in prescription growth rates, unexpected side effects, loss of intellectual property protection, supply chain or product supply shortages, regulatory proceedings, changes in labeling, publicity adversely affecting doctor or patient confidence in our product, material product liability litigation, pressure from new or existing competitive products, or adverse changes in coverage under managed care programs, the adverse impact on our revenue and profit could be significant. In addition, our revenue and profit could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new products.\nOur ability to generate significant product revenue from sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR in the near term will depend on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nDefend our patents, intellectual property and products from competition, both branded and generic;\n\u2022\nMaintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nProduce, through a validated process, sufficiently large quantities of our products to meet demand;\n\u2022\nContinue to maintain a wide variety of internal sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, sufficient to sustain and grow revenue;\n\u2022\nContinue to maintain and grow widespread acceptance of our products from physicians, health care payors, patients, pharmacists and the medical community;\n\u2022\nProperly price and obtain adequate reimbursement coverage of these products by governmental authorities, private health insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nMaintain compliance with ongoing FDA labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, safety and other post-market requirements;\n\u2022\nObtain approval from the FDA to expand the labeling of our approved products, for additional indications;\n\u2022\nAdequately protect against and effectively respond to any claims by holders of patents and other IP rights alleging that our products infringe their rights; and\n\u2022\nAdequately protect against and effectively respond to any unanticipated adverse effects or unfavorable publicity that develops with respect to our products, as well as respond to the emergence of new or existing competitive products, which may be proven to be more clinically effective and cost-effective.\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. We will need to continue investing substantial financial and management resources to maintain our commercial sales and marketing infrastructure and to recruit and train qualified marketing, sales and other personnel.\nSales of Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR may slow for a variety of reasons, including competing products or safety issues. Any increase in sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR will be dependent on several factors, including our ability to educate physicians, to increase physician awareness and physician acceptance of the benefits and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products.\nOur ability to increase market acceptance of any of our products or to gain market acceptance of approved product candidates among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nAcceptable evidence of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nRelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nPrevalence, nature, and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nAvailability of alternative treatments, including branded and generic products; and\n\u2022\nPricing and cost effectiveness.\nFurther, Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR are subject to continual review by the FDA. We cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or reported safety issues will not arise. With the use of any marketed drug by a wider patient population, serious AEs may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to be related to the drug itself. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or to cease marketing of our approved products; cause us to modify how we market our approved products; subject us to substantial liabilities; and adversely affect our revenues and financial condition. In the event of a withdrawal of either Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR from the market, our revenues would decline significantly, and our business would be seriously harmed and could fail.\nIn addition, we have expressed certain long term revenue expectations. If we are not successful in broadening and/or maintaining the current commercial acceptance of either Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR, such that we cannot achieve those revenue expectations with respect to Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, this could result in a material adverse impact on our anticipated revenue, earnings and liquidity.\nIf other versions of extended or controlled release oxcarbazepine or topiramate are approved and successfully commercialized, our business could be materially harmed.\nThird parties have and in the future may receive approval to manufacture and market their own versions of extended release oxcarbazepine or topiramate in the U.S. For example, Upsher-Smith launched Qudexy XR (extended release topiramate) and a branded generic version of Qudexy XR in in 2014. Upsher Smith also entered into settlement with a generic company to launch a generic to Qudexy XR in 2020, and a separate settlement with another generic company to enter the market at a date that is unknown to us. Entry of new generic products could adversely impact the sales or prescriptions for Trokendi XR, or could result in an earlier than anticipated entry of generics to compete with Trokendi XR. We have the right to defend our products against third parties who may infringe or are infringing our patents.\nIn addition, we are aware of companies who are marketing modified-release oxcarbazepine products outside of the U.S., such as Apydan, which was developed by Desitin Arzneimittel GmbH and which requires twice-daily administration. If companies with modified-release oxcarbazepine products outside of the U.S. pursue or obtain approval of their products within the U.S., such competing products may limit the potential success of Oxtellar XR in the U.S. Our business and growth prospects could be materially impaired.\nAccordingly, if any third party is successful in obtaining approval to manufacture and market its own version of extended release oxcarbazepine or topiramate in the U.S., we may not be able to prospectively realize revenues from Oxtellar XR or Trokendi XR.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to payment or reimbursement policies which, if not favorable for our products or product candidates, could hinder or prevent our commercial success.\nOur business is operating in an ever more challenging environment, with significant pressures by federal and state governments, insurers and other payors on the pricing of our products, affecting on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement for our products. The U.S. federal and state governments and payors are under intense pressure to control healthcare spending even more tightly than in the past. These pressures are further compounded by consolidation among distributors, retailers, private insurers, managed care organizations and other private payors, resulting in an increase their negotiating power, particularly with respect to our products. In addition, these pressures are augmented by significant controversies and intense publicity about pricing for pharmaceuticals, which are viewed by some as excessive, as well as government investigations and legal proceedings regarding pharmaceutical pricing practices.\nOur ability or our collaborators' ability to successfully commercialize our products, including Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR, and our product candidates, including SPN-812, will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payors. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that drug products be approved for marketing by the FDA. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs, in some instances, by limiting coverage, by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, or by encouraging the use of lower-cost generic products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any of the products that we develop and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Moreover, that level of reimbursement may change over time, as a result of decisions made by payors. Reduced or partial payment, or reduced reimbursement coverage, could make our products or product candidates, including Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, less attractive to patients and prescribing physicians. We also may be required to sell our products or product candidates at a significant discount, which would adversely affect our ability to realize an appropriate return on our investment in our products or product candidates or to maintain profitability.\nWe expect that private insurers and managed care organizations will consider the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of our products or product candidates, including Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, in determining whether to approve reimbursement for such products or product candidates, and to what extent they will provide reimbursement. Moreover, they will consider the efficacy and cost effectiveness of comparable or competitive products, including generic products, in making reimbursement decisions for our products. Because each third-party payor individually approves payment or reimbursement, obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process, requiring us to provide scientific or clinical support for the use of each of our products or product candidates separately to each third-party payor. In some cases, it could take months or years before a particular private insurer or managed care organization reviews a particular product. We may ultimately be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage. In addition, our competitors may have more extensive existing business relationships with third-party payors that could have an impact on the coverage for our products.\nOur business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of our products or product candidates from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. Our products and product candidates may not be considered cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products or product candidates on a profitable basis. Our business would also be adversely affected if private insurers, managed care organizations, the Medicare program or other reimbursing bodies or payors limit the indications for which our products or product candidates will be reimbursed.\nIn some foreign jurisdictions, particularly Canada and Europe, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 6 to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or to obtain pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products or product candidates, if approved, to other available therapies. If reimbursement for our products or product candidates is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed, and could be unprofitable.\nIn addition, many managed care organizations negotiate the reimbursement price of products through the use of formularies, which establish reimbursement levels. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to sharply reduced usage in the managed care organization's patient population. If our products or product candidates are not included within an adequate number of managed care formularies or reimbursed at adequate levels, or if those policies increasingly favor generic products, our market share and gross margins could be negatively affected. This would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and financial condition.\nWe expect these challenges to continue and potentially to intensify in 2020 and following years, as political pressures mount, and healthcare payors, including government-controlled health authorities, insurance companies and managed care organizations, step up initiatives to reduce the overall cost of healthcare, restrict access to higher-priced new medicines, increase the use of generic products and to impose overall price cuts. Such pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, as well as on our reputation.\nWe depend on wholesalers and distributors for retail distribution of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR. If we lose any of our significant wholesalers or distributors, our business could be harmed.\nThe majority of our sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR are made to wholesalers and distributors who, in turn, sell our products to pharmacies, hospitals and other customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, three wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation, each individually accounted for more than 30% of our total revenue in 2019, and collectively accounted for more than 90% of our total revenue in 2019. The loss of any of these wholesale pharmaceutical distributors' accounts, or a material reduction in their purchases, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nIn addition, these wholesale customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. This distribution network has undergone, and may continue to undergo, significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market. Consolidation of drug wholesalers has increased. This may result in increased competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical products. We cannot assure you that we can manage these pricing pressures, or that wholesaler purchases will not fluctuate unexpectedly from period to period.\nOur sales of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR can be greatly affected by the inventory levels our respective wholesalers and distributors carry. We monitor wholesaler and distributor inventory of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR using a combination of methods. Pursuant to distribution service agreements with our three largest wholesale customers, we receive product inventory reports. For other wholesalers where we do not receive inventory reports, our estimates of wholesaler inventories may differ significantly from actual inventory levels. Significant differences between actual and estimated inventory levels may result in excessive production, resulting in our holding substantial quantities of unsold inventory, or alternatively inadequate supplies of product in distribution channels, resulting in inability to support sales at the retail level. These changes may cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and in some cases may cause our operating results for a particular quarter to be below our expectations, the expectations of securities analysts and/or investors.\nAt times, wholesalers and distributors may increase inventory levels in response to anticipated price increases, resulting in greater wholesaler purchases prior to the anticipated price increase, and reduced wholesaler purchases in later quarters. This may cause substantial fluctuations in our results of operations from period to period. If our financial results are below expectations for a particular period, the market price of our common stock may drop significantly.\nWe may not be able to effectively market and sell our product candidates, if approved, in the U.S.\nWe plan on building our sales and marketing capabilities in the U.S. to commercialize our product candidates, if approved. We will build such capabilities by investing significant amounts of financial and management resources. Furthermore, the cost of establishing and maintaining marketing and sales capabilities may not be economically justifiable, in light of the revenues generated by any of our product candidates.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales and marketing capabilities for our product candidates; if we are unable to do so in a timely manner, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenues from our product candidates to be profitable.\nFinal marketing approval of any of our product candidates, or approval of additional indications for existing products by the FDA or by other regulatory authorities may be delayed, limited, or denied, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nWe are dependent on obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates and approval for additional indications for existing products. Our business depends on the successful clinical development; i.e., successful completion of clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the U.S. until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign jurisdiction, from the requisite authority. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years, is dependent upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product, and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. We cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates. We cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenues from these product candidates.\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate or deny a prior approval supplement (1) for many reasons. For example, the FDA:\n\u2022\nCould reject or delay the marketing application for an NCE;\n\u2022\nCould determine that we cannot rely on Section 505(b)(2) for any approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nCould determine that the information provided by us was inadequate, contained clinical deficiencies, or otherwise failed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific indication;\n\u2022\nMay not find the data from bioequivalence studies and/or clinical trials sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, or to obtain marketing approval in the U.S., including any findings that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates do not outweigh their safety risks;\n\u2022\nMay disagree with our trial design or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies, bioequivalence studies and/or clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our trials; the outcome and measurement scale used in the trials; or the clinical protocols whether with or without a special protocol assessment process;\n\u2022\nMay determine that we have identified the wrong reference listed drug or drugs, or that approval of our Section 505(b)(2) application of our product candidate is blocked by patent or non-patent exclusivity of the reference listed drug or drugs;\n\u2022\nMay identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for the supply of raw materials, including the API or formulated product used in our product candidates, wherein those deficiencies may result in interruption in the ability to supply product;\n\u2022\nMay approve our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials;\n\u2022\nMay change its approval policies or adopt new regulations;\n\u2022\nMay not approve the labeling claims that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates, or may approve them with warnings and precautions that could limit the acceptance of our product candidates and their commercial success; or\n\u2022\nMay not approve the addition of new indications to the label of our existing products.\n_______________________\n(1) Changes that have a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on product quality, identify strength, purity or potency (i.e., major change) require submission of a \"prior approval supplement\" and approval by FDA prior to distribution of the drug product made using the change.\nNotwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Sections 505(b)(1) and 505(b)(2), over the last few years some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA's interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) application that we submit. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates would eliminate our ability to generate revenues for that candidate. Any failure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable could reduce our potential revenues.\nIf we fail to produce our products and product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or fail to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates, or be required to withdraw our products from the market.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our products or for the commercial production of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations at commercial scale in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party CMOs in various countries for the supply of API for our products and product candidates, including drug substance for our preclinical research and clinical trials. For Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, we currently rely on single source suppliers for raw materials, including API, as well as single source suppliers to produce and package final dosage forms. With respect to product candidates, we currently rely on Bachem Americas, Inc. and Bachem AG (collectively Bachem), a company based in Switzerland, as the sole supplier and manufacturer for viloxazine hydrochloride raw material, the API in SPN-812.\nThere is a risk that supplies of our products or product candidates may be significantly delayed by or may become unavailable as a result of manufacturing, equipment, process, or business-related issues affecting our suppliers. Any future curtailment in the availability of raw materials could result in production or other delays, with consequent adverse business effects. In addition, because regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products, changes in raw material suppliers may result in production delays or higher raw material costs. Accordingly, as it relates to SPN-812, for example, we may encounter additional manufacturing and supply-chain risks due to the regulatory and political structure of Switzerland, or as a result of the international relationship between Switzerland and the U.S.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Pharmaceutical companies often encounter difficulties in manufacturing, particularly in scaling up production of their products. These problems can adversely affect production costs and yields, quality control, stability of the product and quality assurance testing, as well as compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations. If we are unable to demonstrate stability in accordance with commercial requirements, or if our manufacturers were to encounter difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us, our ability to obtain or maintain FDA approval and to market our products and product candidates, respectively, would be jeopardized. In addition, any delay or interruption in producing clinical trial supplies could delay or prohibit the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with conducting our clinical trials and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials, at significant additional expense, or to terminate a trial.\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products need to comply with cGMP requirements and other requirements as enforced by the FDA, including electronic tracking and submission. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products and product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA and similar foreign regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any of our products or product candidates is compromised due to failure to adhere to applicable laws, or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidate, or to successfully commercialize such products. We may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay in clinical development, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, entail higher costs, or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, if we fail to obtain the required commercial quantities on a timely basis from our suppliers and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be unable to meet demand for our approved products, or may not be able to sell our products profitably.\nIf we do not obtain marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may suffer.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, three years of marketing exclusivity may be granted for the approval of new and sNDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) applications, for, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration, strengths, or for a new use of an existing drug. If the clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, the FDA may grant exclusivity for the product, sometimes referred to as clinical investigation exclusivity. This prevents the FDA from approving an application under Section 505(b)(2) for the same conditions of use for new clinical investigations prior to the expiration of three years from the date of approval. Such exclusivity, however, would not prevent the approval of another application if the applicant submits a full NDA, and has conducted its own adequate, well-controlled clinical trials, demonstrating safety and efficacy. It would not prevent approval of a generic product or Section 505(b)(2) product that did not incorporate the exclusivity-protected changes of the approved drug product.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, newly-approved drugs and indications may also benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE. This would be the case if the FDA had not previously approved any other drug containing the same API, or active moiety, which is the molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance. Although protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments will not prevent the submission or approval of another full NDA, such an NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.\nWhile the FDA granted a three year marketing exclusivity period for Oxtellar XR, it did not grant a similar marketing exclusivity period for Trokendi XR.\nIn November 2019, we submitted the NDA for SPN-812 to the FDA. We expect SPN-812, if approved, to have a five year market exclusivity, given its NCE status in the U.S. If we are unable to obtain marketing exclusivity for our subsequent product candidates, then our competitors may obtain approval for competing products more easily than if we had such marketing exclusivity. In such an event, our future revenues could be reduced, possibly materially.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with any of our products or product candidates, the sales of those products or product candidates would be adversely affected.\nOnce an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \"listed drug\" which can be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. FDCA, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use or labeling, as our product or product candidate and that the generic product is bioequivalent to our product. Bioequivalence implies that a product is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our product or product candidate. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market. Companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at significantly lower prices. Thus, regardless of the regulatory approval pathway, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product, through both price and volume erosion. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents would adversely, materially, and permanently impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows from those products. In this eventuality, it would substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our products and product candidates.\nIf our competitors develop or market alternatives for treatment of our target indications, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense product-driven competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our products and product candidates. These include large pharmaceutical companies, smaller pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. The availability of new products or the approval of new indications for existing products may limit the demand for and the price we are able to charge for any of our products. We may be unable to differentiate our products from competitive offerings.\nIn addition to competition for our currently marketed products, we anticipate that we will face intense competition when our pipeline product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities, and we begin their commercialization process. In particular, we are aware of several companies that have various product candidates under development to treat ADHD. These may compete with our SPN-812 product candidate. These companies include Sunovion, Ironshore/Highland and Otsuka.\nNew developments, including the development of other drug technologies, may render our products or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. As a result, our products and product candidates may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in connection with their development, or we realize revenues from their commercialization. Moreover, many competitors have substantially greater:\n\u2022\nCapital resources;\n\u2022\nResearch and development resources and experience, including personnel and technology;\n\u2022\nDrug development, clinical trial and regulatory resources and experience, including personnel and technology;\n\u2022\nSales and marketing resources and experience;\n\u2022\nManufacturing and distribution resources and experience;\n\u2022\nName recognition; and\n\u2022\nResources, experience and expertise in prosecution and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to, or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit or block us from developing or commercializing our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, have faster onset to action, better tolerated, subject to fewer or less severe side effects, more widely prescribed or accepted, or less costly than ours. They may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively with the products of our competitors, or if such competitors are successful in developing products that compete with any of our approved product candidates, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even higher level of resources being concentrated at competitors. Competition may intensify as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies, and as a result of greater availability of capital for investment.\nOur products and our product candidates may be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market. We may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements.\nEven though U.S. regulatory approval has been obtained for Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on their indicated uses, or may impose restrictions on marketing, or may impose requirements for costly post-approval studies. For example, both Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR were approved on the basis of post-approval commitments, including the development of additional age-appropriate formulations of the drugs, and the conduct of post-approval clinical studies in accordance with timelines laid out in the approval letters. The post-approval commitments required the creation of new drug product formulations, which we have not been able to accomplish. Despite significant efforts, in certain cases we have been unable to meet the FDA's timelines. Refer to Part I, Item 1 - Post-approval Regulatory Requirements for more information. To date, the only consequence of our failure to meet our PREA commitment deadlines has been a notation on FDA websites, making the status of PREA publicly known.\nWe are also required to conduct an additional post-approval study with respect to Trokendi XR for the treatment of prophylaxis of migraine. If we do not meet our post-marketing commitments, and are unable to show good cause for our inability to adhere to the timetables laid out in the approval letters, the FDA could take enforcement action against us, including withdrawal of approval. While we believe that we can show good cause for our inability to meet the timelines for our post-approval study requirements, the FDA may disagree. Refer to Part I, Item 1 - Post-approval Regulatory Requirements for more information.\nOur products, product candidates and our collaborators' approved products are subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations. If we, our collaborators, or a regulatory authority discovers previously unknown problems with a product, including side effects that are unanticipated in severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product or on the manufacturer, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we or our collaborators, or our products, product candidates, or our collaborators' products, or the manufacturing facilities for our products, product candidates or our collaborators' products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory authority may:\n\u2022\nIssue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nImpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nSuspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nSuspend any ongoing bioequivalence and/or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nRefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nImpose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements, or suspend production for a sustained period of time; or\n\u2022\nSeize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nIn addition, our product labeling, advertising, and promotion of our approved products are subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product's approved labeling. Notwithstanding, physicians may nevertheless prescribe products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, which is known as \"off label use\". The FDA and other authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have promoted off-label use may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we are found to have promoted off-label use, we may be enjoined from such off-label promotion and become subject to significant liability. This could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and revenues.\nFurther, the FDA's policies may prospectively change. Additional government regulations may be enacted that could affect our products or prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements, or to adopt new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we have obtained, adversely affecting our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe depend on collaborators to work with us to develop, manufacture and commercialize their and our products and product candidates.\nWe have a license agreement with United Therapeutics Corporation to use one of our proprietary technologies in an oral formulation of treprostinil diethanolamine, or treprostinil, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, and other indications. United Therapeutics Corporation launched Orenitram (treprostinil) in 2014, which triggered payment of a milestone payment to us of $2.0 million. In the third quarter of 2014, we received a cash payment of $30.0 million from HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P.'s (HC Royalty), for the purchase of certain of our rights under our license agreement with United Therapeutics Corporation related to the commercialization of Orenitram. Ownership of the royalty rights will return to us if/when a certain cumulative threshold payment to HC Royalty is reached. We are entitled to receive milestones and royalties for use of this formulation in indications other than arterial hypertension. If we materially breach any of our obligations under the license agreement, we could lose the right to receive any future royalty payments thereunder, which could be financially significant to us.\nWe intend to rely on third-party collaborators to market and commercialize our products and product candidates outside the U.S. We utilize strategic partners outside the U.S., where appropriate, to assist in the commercialization of our products and product candidates. We currently possess limited resources, and may not be successful in establishing collaborations or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. We also face competition in our search for collaborators and licensing partners. By entering into strategic collaborations or similar arrangements, we rely on third parties to financially support their local operations, including support required for development, commercialization, sales, marketing and regulatory activities, as well as expertise in each of those subject areas.\nOur future collaboration agreements may limit the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties. Much of the potential revenues from these future collaborations may consist of contingent payments, such as payments for achieving certain development milestones, and royalties payable on product sales. The milestones and royalty revenues that we may receive under these collaborations will depend upon our collaborators' ability to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell new products. Future collaboration partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products, product candidates or technologies because they, among other things, may:\n\u2022\nChange the focus of their development and commercialization efforts, or may have insufficient resources to effectively develop our product candidates.\n\u2022\nPharmaceutical and biotechnology companies historically have re-evaluated their development and commercialization priorities following mergers and consolidations, which have been common in recent years. The ability of some of our product candidates to reach their potential could be limited if our future collaborators fail to apply sufficient development or commercialization efforts related to those product candidates;\n\u2022\nDecide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise, limited cash resources, or in the belief that other internal drug development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining marketing approval, or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u2022\nDevelop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the product candidates that are the subject of their collaboration with us;\n\u2022\nNot have necessary and sufficient resources to develop the product candidate through clinical development, marketing approval and commercialization;\n\u2022\nFail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nAre unable to obtain the necessary marketing approvals; or\n\u2022\nBreach or terminate their arrangement with us.\nIf collaboration partners fail to develop or fail to effectively commercialize our products for any of these reasons, we may not be able to replace the collaboration partner with another partner to develop and commercialize the product under the terms of the collaboration, if at all. Further, even if we are able to replace the collaboration partner, we may not be able to do so on commercially favorable terms. As a result, the development and commercialization of the affected product or product candidate could be delayed, impaired, or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue development and commercialization of the product candidate on our own. Failure of our third-party collaborators to successfully market and commercialize our products or product candidates within and outside the U.S. could materially diminish our revenues and harm our results of operations.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the U.S., we or our collaborators may not receive approval to commercialize our product candidates outside of the U.S.\nTo market any product outside of the U.S., we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other regulatory jurisdictions regarding safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions, and can involve product testing and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the U.S. The time required to obtain approval in other jurisdictions might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the U.S., as well as other risks. For example, legislation analogous to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA in the U.S., which relates to the ability of an NDA applicant to use published data not developed by such applicant, may not exist in other countries. In territories where data are not freely available, we may not have the ability to commercialize our products without first negotiating with third parties to obtain their permission to refer to their clinical data in our regulatory applications. This process could require the expenditure of significant additional funds and time.\nIn addition, regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another. A failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory processes in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in other jurisdictions, or any delay or setback in obtaining such approvals, could have the same adverse effects as detailed above regarding FDA approval. As described above, such effects include the risks that any of our product candidates may not be approved for all requested indications, which could limit the uses of our product candidates, and could have an adverse effect on their commercial potential or could require costly post-marketing studies.\nWe have in-licensed or acquired a portion of our intellectual property necessary to develop certain of our product candidates. If we fail to comply with our obligations under any of these arrangements, we could lose such licenses or intellectual property rights.\nWe are a party to and rely on several arrangements with third parties. These arrangements give us rights to IP that are necessary for the development of certain of our product candidates. In addition, we may enter into similar arrangements in the future for other product candidates. Our current arrangements impose various development, financial and other obligations on us. If we materially breach these obligations, or if third parties fail to adequately perform their respective obligations, these exclusive arrangements could be terminated, which could result in our inability to develop, manufacture, market and sell products that are covered by such IP.\nOur failure to successfully develop and market our product candidates would impair our ability to grow.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to develop and market additional product candidates. We may spend substantial resources and several years completing the development of a particular current or future internal product candidate, during which process we can experience failure at any stage, and for many reasons. The product candidates to which we allocate our resources, even if approved, may not be commercially successful. In addition, because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technologies to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select, discover and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and approved products, and to manage our spending as expenses related to undertaking clinical trials can be substantial.\nWe may be unable to acquire product candidates or products.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license, or acquiring a product candidate or an approved product, is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license, the product candidate, or approved product. We have limited resources, including financial resources, to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies, and to integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote significant resources to potential acquisitions or to in-licensing opportunities wherein those transactions are never consummated, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nExposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nDisruption of our business, and diversion of our management's time and attention, to develop acquired products or technologies;\n\u2022\nIncur substantial debt, or dilutive issuances of securities, or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nIncur higher than expected acquisition, integration, and operating costs;\n\u2022\nExperience difficulty in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nImpair relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses, due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022\nUnable to retain and/or motivate key employees of any acquired businesses.\nWe rely on and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for certain of our critical activities, including clinical research of our product candidates, manufacture of our compounds and product candidates beyond Phase II clinical trials, and the manufacture of our commercial products.\nWe rely on outsourcing arrangements for some of our critical activities, including manufacturing, preclinical and clinical research, data collection and analysis, and electronic submission of regulatory filings. We may have limited control over third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will perform their obligations in an effective, competent and timely manner. Our reliance on third parties, including third-party Clinical Research Organizations (CROs) and CMOs, entails risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nNon-compliance by third parties with regulatory and quality control standards;\n\u2022\nSanctions imposed by regulatory authorities if compounds supplied or manufactured by a third party supplier or manufacturer fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nPossible breach of the agreements by the CROs or CMOs because of factors beyond our control, insolvency or other financial difficulties of any of these third parties; labor unrest; natural disasters; or other factors adversely affecting their ability to conduct their business; and\n\u2022\nTermination or non-renewal of an agreement by a third party, at a time that is inconvenient for us, and for reasons not entirely under our control.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our products or product candidates beyond Phase II clinical trials, nor do we have plans in the foreseeable future to develop our own manufacturing operations to support Phase III clinical trials or support commercial production. We currently depend on third-party CMOs for all of our required raw materials and drug substances for our preclinical research and clinical trials. For Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, we currently rely on single source suppliers for raw materials, including API, and rely on third-party manufacturers for the production and packaging of final commercial products. If any of these vendors are unable to perform their obligations to us, including due to violations of the FDA's requirements, our ability to meet regulatory requirements, projected timelines, and necessary quality standards for the development or commercialization of products would be adversely affected. Further, if we were required to change vendors, it could result in substantial delays in our regulatory approval efforts, significantly increase our costs, and delay generation of revenues. Accordingly, the loss of any of our current or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and business prospects.\nOur clinical trials for our product candidates may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy or other requirements, which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval.\nWe may be unable to sufficiently demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in obtaining regulatory approval. We must demonstrate, with substantial evidence gathered in well-controlled studies and to the satisfaction of the relevant regulatory authorities, that each product candidate is safe and effective for use in the target indication. We may be required to conduct additional studies or trials to adequately demonstrate safety and efficacy, which could prevent or significantly delay our receipt of regulatory approval, increase clinical costs, and ultimately delay or otherwise impair the commercialization of that product candidate.\nAny product candidate that we in-license or acquire may require additional development prior to commercial sale, including formulation development, extensive clinical testing, and approval by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical to pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, the results from the trials that we have completed for our product candidates may not be replicated in future trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced development, even after promising results in earlier trials. If our product candidates are not shown to be safe and effective, these clinical development programs might be terminated.\nDelays or failures in the completion of clinical development of our product candidates would increase our costs, delay, or limit our ability to generate revenues.\nDelays or failures in the completion of clinical trials for our product candidates could significantly raise our product development costs. We do not know whether current or planned trials will be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical development can be delayed or halted for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nDifficulties in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial, or in complying with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or term of a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nDifficulties obtaining Investigational Research Board (IRB) or ethics committee approval to conduct a trial at a prospective site;\n\u2022\nDelays in reaching or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective trial sites and investigators, the contractual terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly from site to site;\n\u2022\nInsufficient or inadequate supply of or quantity of a product candidate for use in trials;\n\u2022\nChallenges recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials, for any and all reasons, including competition from other programs for the treatment of similar conditions;\n\u2022\nSevere or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nDifficulty retaining patients who have enrolled in a clinical trial, but who may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy, or personal issues;\n\u2022\nTemporary cessation of clinical trials (clinical holds); or\n\u2022\nDelays due to ambiguous or negative interim results in clinical trials.\nClinical trials may be suspended or terminated by us; or at a trial site by the site's Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or ethics committee overseeing the clinical trial; or by the FDA; or by other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nFailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial protocols;\n\u2022\nObservations during inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities which ultimately result in the imposition of a delay or clinical hold;\n\u2022\nUnforeseen safety issues; or\n\u2022\nLack of adequate funding to continue the trial.\nFailure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the trial protocols may result in the inability to use the trial data to support product approval. Changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs or ethics committees for reexamination, which may adversely impact the cost, timing and/or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nIn addition, many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we experience delays in completion, or if we terminate any of our clinical trials, our ability to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates may be materially harmed, and our commercial prospects and ability to generate product revenues diminished.\nOur products and product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other characteristics that limit their commercial potential, delay, or prevent their regulatory approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt development. This could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, and result in potential product liability claims. Undesirable side effects caused by any of our products could cause regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently halt product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nImmediate release oxcarbazepine and topiramate products, which use the same APIs (Active Product Ingredient) as Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, are known to cause various side effects, including but not limited to dizziness, paresthesia, headaches, cognitive deficiencies such as memory loss and speech impediment, digestive problems, somnolence, double vision, gingival enlargement, nausea, weight gain, oral malformation birth defects, visual field defects, infants small for gestational age, and fatigue. The use of Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR may cause similar side effects as compared to their reference products, or may cause additional or different side effects.\nProducts that were or are currently on the market and use the same API as our product candidates, including SPN-812, SPN-810 (drug products), SPN-817 (dietary supplements), and SPN-604, were known to cause various side effects, including but not limited to drowsiness, depression, hyperactivity, euphoria, extrapyramidal reactions, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, sleep difficulties, agitation, exacerbation of anxiety, sleepiness, mouth dryness, tachycardia, constipation and urinary difficulties. The labels for those products also included precautions and warnings about; among other things; tardive dyskinesia; neuroleptic malignant syndrome; elevation of prolactin levels; convulsive events in patients that are treated for or have a prior history of epilepsy; inhibition of hepatic metabolism of certain drugs; risk of suicide before antidepressant clinical improvement; need for monitoring patients with cardiac, hepatic or renal insufficiency; or patients at risk for angle-closure glaucoma. The use of SPN-812, SPN-810, SPN-817 and SPN-604 may cause similar side effects as compared to these reference products, or may cause additional or different side effects.\nIf our products cause side effects, or if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by our products or product candidates, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nRegulatory authorities may withdraw approval of the product candidate or otherwise require us to take the approved product off the market;\n\u2022\nRegulatory authorities may require additional warnings, or a narrowing of the indication on the product label;\n\u2022\nWe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the proper use of the medication and the risks of side effects, for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nWe may be required to modify the product in some way;\n\u2022\nRegulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional clinical trials, or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance, to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product;\n\u2022\nSales of approved products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nWe could be sued and be held liable for harm caused to patients; or\n\u2022\nOur reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining the commercial success of our products and product candidates, and could substantially increase commercialization costs.\nWe may not obtain or maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including market exclusivity.\nRegulatory authorities in the United States may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the U.S. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research, and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. In addition, if a drug receives its first FDA approval in an indication for which it has orphan drug designation, that drug is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity. This implies that the FDA may not approve any other firm's application for the same drug for that same indication for a period of seven years. Exceptions are limited, such as showing clinical superiority over the drug with orphan drug exclusivity.\nAlthough we have been granted FDA orphan drug designation for SPN-817 for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome, and we intend to expand our designation for alternative uses where applicable, we may not receive the benefits associated with orphan drug designation. This may result from a failure to maintain orphan drug status, or it may result from a competing product reaching the market with an orphan designation for the same disease indication. Under U.S. rules for orphan drugs, if such a competing product reaches the market before ours does, the competing product could potentially obtain a scope of market exclusivity that limits or precludes our product from being sold in the U.S. for seven years. Even if we obtain exclusivity, the FDA could subsequently approve an alternative drug for the same condition, if the FDA concludes that the second to reach the market is clinically superior in that it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a competitor may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which our orphan product has exclusivity, or may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.\nIn August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) was enacted. FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA's pre-existing regulatory interpretation to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period, regardless of showing clinical superiority.\nThe FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act, including the FDARA amendment, its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future. It is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products or product candidates.\nThe U.S., certain states, and certain foreign governments have shown significant, increased interest in pursuing healthcare reform and changes to the healthcare delivery system. Government-adopted reform measures could adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the U.S. or internationally, adversely impacting the level of reimbursement available from governmental agencies and/or commercial third-party payors. The continuing efforts of third-party payors, including U.S. federal and state agencies, foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations, employers, and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce healthcare costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices at launch or to increase prices once launched. These initiatives could adversely impact our ability to generate revenues, to achieve profitability, or to and maintain profitability. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the healthcare system in ways that could adversely affect our ability to profitably sell any approved product. Some of these proposed reforms would result in reduced reimbursement rates for our products, which would adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results.\nIn March 2010, then President Obama signed into law a comprehensive change to the U.S. healthcare system, known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. These laws and their regulations, which we refer to collectively as the HealthCare Reform Law, have far reaching consequences for pharmaceutical companies like us. Possible revisions to the HealthCare Reform Law are the subject of ongoing legislative debates and litigation.\nThe HealthCare Reform Law has continued to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and has increased the industry's regulatory burden and operating costs. Among the provisions of the HealthCare Reform Law of importance to our products and product candidates are the following:\n\u2022\nAn annual, nondeductible fee payable to the U.S. federal government, by any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs or biologic agents. This fee is based on each company's market share of prior year total sales of branded products to certain federal healthcare programs;\n\u2022\nAn increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022\nRebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u2022\nA Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer a substantial point-of-sale discount off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nExtension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nExpansion of the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs in certain states;\n\u2022\nExpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nA requirement to annually report the amount of drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u2022\nA Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities for, and to conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nOther legislative changes have been adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, it will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken.\nThe FDA statutes, regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. Future regulatory changes could make it more difficult for us to maintain or attain approval to develop and commercialize our products and technologies.\nThe FDA has enhanced its post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, or to require compliance with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. Further, the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act expanded drug supply chain reporting requirements and strengthened the FDA's response to drug shortages. The FDA's exercise of its authority could result in delays, or could increase costs during product development, and regulatory review. It could also result in increased costs to assure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements, and could result in potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of any approved product.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The Trump Administration and U.S. Congress have attempted, and will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders as well as other directives designed to delay, circumvent or loosen the implementation of certain provisions mandated by the Affordable Care Act that would otherwise impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), which included a provision that repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. This is commonly referred to as the \"individual mandate.\" Additionally, in January 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including: the so-called \"Cadillac\" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans; the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share; and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. In addition, in December 2018, a Texas Federal District Court struck down the entire Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional, holding that following the elimination of the tax penalty under the Affordable Care Act, the remaining individual mandate portion of the Affordable Care Act could not be justified as a proper and legitimate use of Congress' taxing power. Because the Court deemed the individual mandate as inseverable from the rest of the Affordable Care Act, the entire Affordable\nCare Act was rendered unconstitutional. This case will be appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and could ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nCongress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. It is difficult to predict the extent to which any of these changes to the Affordable Care Act, or additional changes, if made, may impact our business or any financial condition.\nThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three years to five years. In 2019, the Trump Administration put forth a proposal to eliminate certain rebates pharmaceutical companies pay insurance companies under Medicare. The proposal would allow pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate rebates as long as the savings are passed directly to consumers at the pharmacy. More recently, there have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring: more transparency to drug pricing; reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare; review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs; and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.\nSeveral of the Democratic presidential candidates running in the 2020 election are proposing a single-payer national health insurance system, often dubbed \"Medicare for All\". \"Medicare for All\" would likely establish a single public or quasi-public agency that organizes healthcare financing, but healthcare delivery would remain private. While expanding Medicare would increase the demand for prescription drugs, there is a likelihood that Medicare will be required to negotiate drug prices with manufactures, which could adversely affect our future prospects.\nCertain U.S. states have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, and restrictions on access to certain products. Marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products, and which suppliers, will be included in their prescription drug formularies. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors, or other similar restrictions, could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Alternatively, these could prevent us from being able to commercialize our products, or to generate an acceptable return on our investment.\nThe availability of generic products may also substantially increase pricing pressures on, and reduce reimbursement for our future products. We expect to experience continued pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our products, due to the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, their increasing leverage in pricing negotiations, and additional legislative changes.\nThe Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) became law in 2013. DQSA creates the requirement for companies to trace, verify and identify all products through the entire supply chain, from manufacturer to dispenser.\nIn 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) was signed into law. The Cures Act was designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorized increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The law also amended the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Cures Act established the NIH Innovation Fund, to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigations and research. It also charged the NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.\nIn August 2017, President Trump signed FDARA into law. FDARA reauthorized the various user fees to facilitate the FDA's review and oversight relating to prescription drugs, generic drugs, medical devices and biosimilars. The legislation also included several policy riders that will impact an array of issues within the FDA's authority, including, among others, pediatric study requirements, orphan drug exclusivity, and the approval process for generic drugs. With amendments to the FDCA and the PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act sought to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorized the existing priority review voucher program through 2020, for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases; created a new priority review voucher program for drug applications, which are determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revised the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; required the FDA to evaluate the potential use of \"real world evidence\" to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provided a new \"limited population\" approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorized the FDA to designate a drug as a \"regenerative advanced therapy,\" thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.\nOn September 19, 2019, the U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a plan to lower the cost of prescription drugs by allowing the federal government to negotiate prices annually for the most expensive drugs on the market. On December 6, 2019, House Republican leaders released a bipartisan alternative to Speaker Pelosi\u2019s plan. On December 12, 2019, the House passed H.R.3. known as the Lower Drug Costs Now Act and sent it to the Senate for consideration. Any prescription drug pricing legislation that is ultimately adopted may affect the success of our products, product candidates, and profitability.\nFuture healthcare reforms in the U.S. and in other countries could limit the prices that can be charged for our products and product candidates, or may otherwise limit our commercial opportunities.\nImplementation of any change in healthcare laws could cause us to incur significant compliance expenses or could subject us to substantial penalties and fines if our business is found to violate these requirements.\nThe assessment of the financial impact of the HealthCare Reform Law on our business is on-going. There can be no assurance that our business will not be materially harmed by future implementation of or changes to the HealthCare Reform Law. If we are not in full compliance with the HealthCare Reform Law, we could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties. We could receive adverse publicity.\nThe HealthCare Reform Law includes various provisions designed to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. These include increasing funding for enforcement efforts, and lowering the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal healthcare fraud statute, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge or specific intent to violate the statute.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, both civil and criminal, damages, fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of the HealthCare Reform Law, its underlying regulations, or other laws impacted by its implementation is made more complex by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts. Their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against these assertions, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties. Our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs a supplier of pharmaceuticals, certain U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to patients' rights to privacy, fraud and abuse protection, are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to allegations of healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Regulations include the:\n\u2022\nFederal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for an item or service, or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation. Further, the government may assert that a claim, including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below. On October 19, 2019, additional Anti-Kickback regulations were proposed which, if adopted, would create new and change existing safe harbors. Safe harbors protect certain arrangements from prosecution, if each of the elements of the safe harbor is satisfied;\n\u2022\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things: individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. This may apply to entities like us, which provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u2022\nFederal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nFederal physician payment transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments, and to report other transfers of value, physician ownership and investment interests;\n\u2022\nFederal price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on our commercial products;\n\u2022\nFDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use, and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and\n\u2022\nState law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback laws, physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws, and false claims laws which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to: research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements; claims for items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines, and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances. Many of these state laws differ from one another in significant ways, and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above, or in violation of any governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, and could impair our financial results.\nAlthough compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products and product candidates.\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products and product candidates, wherein those regulations or guidelines could affect the use of our products. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations, and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care provider and patient communities. Recommendations from government agencies or these other groups or organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of concomitant therapies. Recommendations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of our products, or the use of competitive or alternative products which are subsequently followed by patients and health care providers, could result in decreased use of our products.\nWe could be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time consuming, distracting, and ultimately unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. For example, we were involved in several matters related to Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letters that we received in connection with our products and our collaborators' products. In connection with an ANDA (Abbreviated New Drug Application), a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter notifies the FDA that one or more patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book is alleged to be invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the competitive ANDA product.\nIn any infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or enforceable, or the court may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue, on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, or interpreted narrowly, and could put our patent application at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the USPTO (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications, or the patents of our collaborators. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology, or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us, or offer terms at all. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail. Even if successful, litigation may result in substantial costs, and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our collaborators, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as they are protected in the U.S.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nIn addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceeding or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, or perceive that the presence or continuation of these cases creates a level of uncertainty regarding our ability to increase or sustain products sales, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that our product candidates will not be subject to the same risks.\nLimitations on our patent rights relating to our products and product candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nTo a significant degree, our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for: our proprietary technologies; for both our products and product candidates; to preserve our trade secrets; to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights; and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. To that end, we seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our products and product candidates. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary positions by, among other things, filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad (including Europe, Canada and certain other countries when appropriate) relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business.\nThe strength of patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves complex legal and scientific questions, and can have uncertain results. Patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time until they are published. Publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months, or more. As a result, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive inventions covered by our patents and pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. In addition, we cannot be certain that our patent applications will be granted; that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property; or that such patents will not be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.\nWe also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, with our collaborators, and with our consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us.\nIt is possible that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees and consultants that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies. We could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Further, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or could be independently discovered by our competitors. Any failure to adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent, or in the same manner as the U.S.. Therefore, we may encounter problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it could be costly and time consuming to defend such a suit. An unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our approved products and our product candidates, and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing product candidates. As the pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our collaborators' approved products, or our product candidates, may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. There may be issued patents of third parties that we are currently unaware of, and that may be infringed by our collaborators' approved products, or Oxtellar XR, or Trokendi XR. These patents could prevent us from being able to maximize revenue generated by our products, or our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents. Our collaborators' approved products, our products, or our product candidates may infringe those issued patents.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties alleging that our collaborators' approved products, our products, or product candidates infringe their intellectual property rights. If one of our collaborators' approved products, our products, or our product candidates is found to infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, we or our collaborators could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages. In such an event, we could be prevented from commercializing the applicable approved products or product candidates, unless we obtain a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction, or other equitable relief, which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our approved products prior to a trial. Such a trial may not occur for several years.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. If a third party claims that we or our collaborators infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nInfringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate, and which may divert our management's attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nSubstantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue infringes on or violates the third party's rights. If the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages, and pay the patent owner's legal fees;\n\u2022\nCourt rulings prohibiting us from selling our products or product candidates, unless the third party licenses its rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022\nIf a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees or grant cross-licenses to our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nRedesigning our products or product candidates, so they do not infringe. This may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies. Our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or in lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case, causing damage to our business.\nWe face potential litigation and product liability exposures. If successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and the amount of damages claimed in litigation against the pharmaceutical industry has increased. While we strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest standards, we nevertheless remain exposed to litigation risk. We could be sued by many different parties, including, for example, consumers, healthcare providers, or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products and product candidates. Lawsuits or investigations that we may become involved in could be very expensive. These claims may be highly damaging to our reputation, even if the underlying claims are without merit, thereby adversely affecting our business.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials, and the commercial sale of any of our products expose us to the risk of product liability claims. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nDecreased demand for a commercial product;\n\u2022\nImpairment of our business reputation and exposure to adverse publicity;\n\u2022\nWithdrawal of bioequivalence and/or clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nInitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\nCosts related to litigation;\n\u2022\nDistraction of management's attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nSubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nLoss of revenues; and\n\u2022\nOur inability to commercialize products for which we are obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials is limited to $15 million per claim, and $15 million in the aggregate. Insurance covers bodily injury and property damage arising from our clinical trials, subject to industry-standard terms, conditions and exclusions. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits for drugs that had unanticipated side effects. In the future, potential inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, or at all, to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent, or inhibit, the development and commercialization of the pharmaceutical products we develop.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our legal claims, or other losses that we may incur in the future.\nWe seek to minimize any losses we may incur through various insurance contracts from third-party insurance carriers. However, our insurance coverage is subject to large individual claim deductibles, individual claim and aggregate policy limits, and other terms and conditions. We cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient to cover our losses. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us, or available at all. Any such losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. As such, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed trade secrets, or disclosed other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs, and be a distraction to management.\nAs we continue to increase the size of our organization, we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nOur personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support future growth. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in significant degree, on our ability to effectively manage our recent and any future growth. In 2019, we increased employee headcount from 448 employees to 464 employees. Revenues in 2019 were $392.8 million, compared to $408.9 million in 2018. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we:\n\u2022\nManage regulatory approvals and clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\nManage our internal development efforts effectively and in a cost effective manner, while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors, collaborators and other third parties;\n\u2022\nCommercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nImprove our operational, financial and management controls, financial reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022\nAttract, retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented employees, with the requisite skills and experience.\nThis growth could place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure, and may require our management to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, or to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. This may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure; give rise to operational mistakes; loss of business opportunities; loss of employees; and reduced productivity.\nWe may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In addition, our growth will cause us to comply with an increasing number of regulations and statutory requirements. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected; our ability to generate or increase our revenues could be impaired; and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\nWe face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of key executives is critical to our success. Our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance.\nWe are highly dependent upon skilled personnel in key parts of our organization, and we invest heavily in recruiting, training and retaining qualified individuals, which includes significant efforts to enhance the diversity of our workforce. The loss of the service of key members of our organization, including senior members of our scientific and management teams, high-quality researchers, development specialists, and skilled personnel, could delay or prevent the achievement of major business objectives. Our future growth will demand talented employees and leaders, yet the market for such talent has become increasingly competitive. In addition, our ability to hire qualified personnel also depends on our flexibility to reward superior performance, and to pay competitive compensation.\nWe may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management, scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. If we are not able to attract and motivate key personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that may significantly impede the achievement of our objectives.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employees and members of our management team could hinder our strategic planning and business execution. In addition, our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and for other key management roles, or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the development, regulatory, commercial and financial expertise of our management, particularly Jack A. Khattar, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Khattar has an employment agreement. Other members of the senior management team have executive retention agreements, but these agreements do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. If we lose key members of our management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely fashion, if at all. We cannot be certain that future management transitions will not disrupt our operations, or will not generate concern among employees and those with whom we do business.\nIn addition to competition for personnel, our corporate offices are located in the greater Washington D.C. metropolitan area, an area that is characterized by a high cost of living. As such, we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our Company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts. As a result, despite significant efforts on our part, we may be unable to attract and retain qualified individuals in sufficient numbers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may enter into significant, complex and unusual transactions, which may require us to engage outside consultants and financial professionals in order to comply with complex accounting and reporting requirements.\nFrom time to time, the Company may be presented with, and may choose to enter into, significant, complex and unusual business or financial transactions, either to raise capital or in the context of entering into a business arrangement with a third party. These transactions may entail complex accounting or financial reporting requirements, with which we may not be familiar. Accordingly, we may need to hire additional personnel, or retain the services of outside accounting, financial reporting, and legal experts, to guide both the transaction and to assist management in becoming compliant with the attendant financial reporting requirements. Acquiring such additional resources could increase our legal and financial compliance costs, divert management's attention from other matters, and/or make certain activities more time consuming.\nGiven the complexity of such transactions, there is inherent risk regarding compliance with financial reporting requirements. Because the relevant regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretation, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time, as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, and as the market gains familiarity with these requirements. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters, and on-going financial reporting requirements.\nIf our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and accounting standards differ from the intentions of regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur operations rely on sophisticated information technology, systems and infrastructure, a disruption of which could harm our operations.\nWe may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In addition, we rely on various information technology, and systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to manage our technology platform and operations.\nThese systems provide critical data and services for internal and external users, including procurement, inventory management, transaction processing, financial, commercial and operational data, human resources management, legal and tax compliance, financial reporting and other information necessary to operate and manage our business. These systems are complex, and are frequently updated as technology improves. This includes software and hardware that is licensed, leased or purchased from third parties. If our information technology, equipment or systems fail to function properly due to internal errors or defects, implementation or integration issues, catastrophic events or power outages, we may experience a material disruption in our ability to manage our business operations. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Any failure to manage, expand, or update our information technology infrastructure, or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure, could harm our business.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we or our vendors collect and store sensitive data in our or their data centers and on our networks, including: intellectual property; proprietary business information; proprietary information of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and personally identifiable information of our employees and patients in our clinical trials. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we procure from third parties, or through open source solutions, may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment which is increasingly hostile to information security, and to the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of information critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Despite our efforts to improve our information security controls, it is possible that the security controls we have implemented to safeguard personal data and our networks, train our employees and vendors on data security, and implement security requirements and other practices, we may not prevent the compromise of our networks or the improper disclosure of data that we or our vendors store and manage. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors, and vendors. If we, our vendors, or other third parties with whom we do business experience significant data security breaches, or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions. Improper disclosure could also harm our reputation, create risks for customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal information. This could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nWe recently completed a move to our new headquarters and we may face disruption and additional costs as we complete the move-in process.\nWe have entered into a lease to relocate our corporate headquarters in 2019. In connection with the relocation, we incurred additional expenses, including those related to moving and costs to leave our existing facilities, tenant improvements and associated expenses not covered by the landlord, as well as furniture and equipment purchases for the new corporate headquarters. As we complete the move-in process, the relocation could result in additional business disruption, and could have a negative impact on our operating results. In addition, we may incur charges related to exiting our current lease if we are not able to exit or release on favorable terms.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations. This can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur activities and the activities conducted by our third-party manufacturers and suppliers involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to federal, state, city and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures we use for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials, and may interrupt our business operations, including our commercialization, research and development efforts. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations, we have no direct control over our third-party manufacturers, and therefore cannot guarantee that this is the case. We can eliminate the risk of accidental contamination, or that such safety procedures will prevent injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages. Such liability could exceed our resources.\nWe do not currently maintain biological or hazardous materials insurance coverage. While we have implemented processes and procedures to ensure that the suppliers we use are complying with all applicable regulations, there can be no assurances that such suppliers in all instances will comply with such processes and procedures, or otherwise comply with applicable regulations. Noncompliance could result in our marketing and distribution of contaminated, defective or dangerous products, which could subject us to liabilities. This could result in the imposition by governmental authorities of procedures or penalties that could restrict or eliminate our ability to sell products. Any or all of these effects could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions in our agreement with Shire, or its successor, impose restrictive covenants on us, which could limit our ability to operate effectively in the future.\nIn 2005, we purchased substantially all of the assets of Shire Laboratories Inc., the predecessor of Supernus Pharmaceuticals. Under the purchase agreement, we agreed to refrain perpetually from engaging in any research, formulation development, analytical testing, manufacture, technology assessment, or oral bioavailability screening that relate to five specific drug compounds (i.e., amphetamine, carbamazepine, guanfacine, lanthanum and mesalamine), and any derivative thereof. Although these various restrictions and covenants on us do not currently impact our products, product candidates or business, they could in the future limit or delay our ability to take advantage of business opportunities that may relate to such compounds.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nAlthough we have been profitable from operations since the fourth quarter of 2014, there is no assurance that we will continue to generate net income in the future. We may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\nIn recent years, we have focused primarily on developing our current products and product candidates, with the goal of commercializing these products and supporting regulatory approval for our product candidates. We have financed our operations through revenue generated from operations and various transactions including the following:\n\u2022\nThe completion of our $52.3 million initial public offering in May 2012;\n\u2022\nThe completion of our follow-on $49.9 million equity offering in November 2012;\n\u2022\nThe completion of our $90.0 million private placement offering of 7.50% Convertible Senior Secured Notes (2019 Notes) in May 2013;\n\u2022\nThe $30.0 million monetization of certain future royalty streams in 2014, under our existing license for Orenitram; and\n\u2022\nThe completion of our $402.5 million private placement of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes (2023 Notes) in March 2018.\nOur ability to remain profitable depends upon our ability to generate the same or increasing levels of revenue from sales of our products, Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, while simultaneously funding the requisite research expenditures to gain FDA approval for our product candidates. Since 2013, the first year in which we generated revenue from our first commercial products, we have demonstrated the ability to become and remain profitable. Future revenues will highly depend on our ability to maintain or grow demand for our products and defend against potential generic competition, and successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had retained earnings of approximately $199.5 million. However, prior to 2018, we had incurred significant operating losses since inception through 2014, substantially as a consequence of costs incurred in connection with our development programs, expenses associated with launching our products, and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect our research and development costs to continue to be substantial and to increase with respect to our product candidates, as we advance those product candidates through preclinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up and other pre-approval activities. We expect our selling, general and administrative costs to continue to increase as we continue to support the ongoing commercialization of our products, and to further increase in anticipation of launching our product candidates.\nWhile we anticipate maintaining profitability in 2020 and beyond, we cannot be certain that we will do so. Any potential future losses, if and when they occur, could have an adverse impact on our stockholders' equity and working capital.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year, as a result of revenue generated from approved products, our license agreements, the amount and timing of development milestones, and product revenue received under our collaboration license agreements.\nOur net earnings and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe level of market acceptance for any approved product candidate, underlying demand for that product and wholesalers' buying patterns;\n\u2022\nVariations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n\u2022\nThe success of our product development and clinical trial activities through all phases of clinical development;\n\u2022\nOur execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar commercial arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nAny delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development;\n\u2022\nThe timing of any regulatory approvals, if received, of additional indications for our existing products;\n\u2022\nPotential side effects of our products and our future products that could delay or prevent commercialization, cause an approved drug to be taken off the market, or result in litigation;\n\u2022\nAny intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain an effective sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u2022\nOur dependency on third-party manufacturers to supply or manufacture our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nCompetition from existing products, new products, or potential generics to our products or to competitive products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nRegulatory developments affecting our products and product candidates; and\n\u2022\nChanges in reimbursement environment and regulatory changes.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization or business development efforts.\nDeveloping or acquiring product candidates, conducting clinical trials, establishing manufacturing relationships and marketing drugs are expensive and uncertain processes.\nIn addition, unforeseen circumstances may arise, or our strategic imperatives could change, causing us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, requiring us to raise additional funds. We have no committed external sources of funds.\nThe amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully support our products in the marketplace and the rate of increase in the level of sales in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nThe rate of progress, clinical success, and cost of our trials and other product development programs for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nThe costs and timing of in-licensing product candidates or acquiring other complementary companies;\n\u2022\nThe timing of any regulatory approvals of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nThe actions of our competitors and their success in selling competitive product offerings, including generics; and\n\u2022\nThe status, terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangement.\nAdditional financing may not be available in the amount we require or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs, our commercialization efforts or strategic initiatives.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited, or may expire prior to utilization.\nOur ability to utilize our U.S. federal and state net operating losses or U.S. federal tax credits is currently limited, and may be limited further, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The limitations apply if an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, occurs. Generally, an ownership change occurs when certain shareholders change their aggregate ownership position by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage in a testing period, which is typically three years, or since the last ownership change. We are already subject to Section 382 limitations due to cumulative ownership changes that, as of November 15, 2013, totaled more than 50%. As of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10.8 million and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $4.2 million. Future changes in stock ownership may also trigger an additional ownership change and, consequently, another Section 382 or Section 383 limitation.\nAny limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards before utilization, which would reduce our gross deferred income tax assets. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to reduce U.S. federal and state income tax may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future cash tax liability to us.\nComplying with increased financial reporting and securities laws reporting requirements has increased our costs and requires additional management resources. We may fail to meet these obligations.\nWe face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company. Compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ, for example, has resulted in significant initial cost to us as well as ongoing increases in our legal, audit and financial reporting costs. As of the beginning of 2017, we transitioned from \"accelerated filer\" to \"large accelerated filer\" status, which led to further increases in our legal, audit, NASDAQ listing fees and financial compliance costs. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Our board of directors, management and outside advisors need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and require us to incur substantial and increasing costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nAs a public company, we are subject to Section 404 of SOX relating to internal controls over financial reporting. We have and expect to continue to incur significant expense and to devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with Section 404. We currently do not have an internal audit group. We have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. We expect that we will have to compete in the market place for qualified accounting and financial staff and we may have difficulties identifying and attracting qualified persons.\nImplementing any necessary changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training for our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify or replace our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate consolidated financial statements or other reports on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. We cannot give assurance that our internal controls over financial reporting will prove to be effective.\nWe may identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which might cause stockholders to lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which in turn would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and adequate disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. These are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing conducted by us in connection with Section 404(a) of SOX, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm in connection with Section 404(b) of SOX, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. These may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or may identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any material weaknesses in our internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis. Our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. The annual independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls is very expensive, and could detect problems that our management's assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nWe are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we will file with the SEC is properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We are also continuing to improve our internal controls over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses.\nOur acquisition strategy entails numerous risks. Our ability to complete future acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates. If suitable candidates are identified, we may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for their acquisition or, if necessary, to finance those acquisitions. We anticipate competition for attractive candidates from other parties, some of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. Whether or not any particular acquisition is successfully completed, each of these activities is expensive and time consuming and would likely require our management to spend considerable time and effort to complete, which would detract from our management's ability to run our current business. Although we may spend considerable funds and efforts to pursue acquisitions, we may not be able to complete them.\nAcquisitions could result in the occurrence of one or more of the following events:\n\u2022\nDilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u2022\nIncurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nIncreased amortization of expenses related to intangible assets;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies\n\u2022\nDiversion of management's attention from our other business activities; and\n\u2022\nAssumption of debt and liabilities of the target company\nWe may have difficulties integrating acquisitions.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to complete acquisitions that we believe are necessary to complement our growth strategy on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, if we do successfully integrate the operations of any companies that we have acquired or subsequently acquire, we may not achieve the potential benefits of such acquisitions. Even if we are able to consummate an acquisition, the transaction would present many risks, including, among others: failing to achieve anticipated revenues, profits, benefits or cost savings; difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies, services or products; difficulty in coordinating, establishing or expanding sales, distribution and marketing functions, as necessary; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; being exposed to unanticipated or contingent liabilities from the acquired company, or incurring the impairment of goodwill; the loss of key employees or distribution partners; and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls, policies and procedures over the systems, products and processes of the acquired company. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by management, or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do, there could be a material, adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Stock\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock, which would impair our ability to raise future capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities convertible into our common stock to fund acquisitions, finance operations or for other purposes. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding 52,533,348 shares of common stock, of which approximately 1,959,294 shares are restricted securities that may be sold in accordance with the resale restrictions under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), or pursuant to a resale registration statement. Also, as of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding options to purchase 4,606,559 shares of common stock that, if exercised, would result in these additional shares becoming available for sale. Approximately 6% of these shares and options are held by senior management of the Company. We have also registered all common stock subject to options outstanding or reserved for issuance under our 2005 Stock Plan, 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. An aggregate of 1,972,307 and 54,081 shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, respectively.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock. Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price for our common stock historically has been volatile. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in stock market prices for the U.S. stock market;\n\u2022\nThe commercial performance of Oxtellar XR, Trokendi XR, or any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nSubstitution of our products in favor of generic versions of our products or competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nStatus of patent infringement law suits, if applicable;\n\u2022\nThe filing of ANDAs by generic companies seeking approval to market generic versions of our products;\n\u2022\nPlans for, progress in, and results from clinical trials of our product candidates generally;\n\u2022\nFDA or international regulatory actions, including actions on regulatory applications for any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nMarket conditions and regulatory changes in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022\nVariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nLitigation or public concern about the safety of our products and/or potential products;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nDeviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nSales or purchases of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\nChanges in third-party coverage and reimbursement policies for our products and/or product candidates; and\n\u2022\nDiscussion by us of our stock price in the financial or scientific press or online investor communities.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in these \"Risk Factors\" could have a dramatic, material and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention, which could hurt our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If securities or industry analysts presently covering our business do not continue such coverage, or if additional securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our Company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control, which could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes, serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time. This staggered board structure prevents stockholders from replacing the entire board at a single stockholders' meeting;\n\u2022\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock. The ability to authorize preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us;\n\u2022\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors, or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. Furthermore, stockholders may only remove a member of our board of directors for cause. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect such acquiror's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company;\n\u2022\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions outside of a stockholders' meeting;\n\u2022\nSpecial meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to call a special meeting; and\n\u2022\nA supermajority (75%) of the voting power of outstanding shares of our capital stock is required to amend, repeal or adopt any provision inconsistent with certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and to amend our by-laws, which make it more difficult to change the provisions described above.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law, could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors.\nWe may not be able to maintain an active public market for our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our common stock will allow us to maintain an active trading market on the NASDAQ Global Market or a similar market or how liquid that market might be. If an active public market is not sustained, it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to the investor, or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, or may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products, product candidates or technologies by using our shares of common stock as consideration.\nTo the extent outstanding stock options are exercised, there will be dilution to new investors.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had issued options to purchase 4,606,559 shares of common stock outstanding, with exercise prices ranging from $2.56 to $58.15 per share and a weighted average exercise price of $23.05 per share. Upon the vesting of each of these options, the holder may exercise his or her options, which would result in dilution to investors.\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes.\nWe incurred $402.5 million of additional indebtedness as a result of the sale of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (2023 Notes). We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n\u2022\nIncreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nLimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nRequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nLimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\nDiluting the economic interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the 2023 Notes, notwithstanding the convertible hedge and warrant transactions; and\n\u2022\nPlacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the 2023 Notes.\nThe issuance or sale of shares of our common stock, or rights to acquire shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and the 2023 Notes.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock to finance our operations or fund acquisitions, or for other purposes. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, 4,606,559 shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, 1,972,307 shares were reserved for future issuance under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and 54,081 shares were reserved for future issuance under our 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nThe indenture for the 2023 Notes will not restrict our ability to issue additional equity securities in the future. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or issue rights to acquire shares of our common stock, if any of our existing stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock, or if the market perceives that such issuances or sales may occur, then the trading price of our common stock, and, accordingly, the 2023 Notes, may significantly decrease. In addition, our issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing common stockholders, including noteholders who have received shares of our common stock upon conversion of their 2023 Notes.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the 2023 Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the 2023 Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nNoteholders may require us to repurchase their 2023 Notes following a fundamental change, at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we must satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the 2023 Notes, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law and/or regulatory authorities may restrict our ability to repurchase the 2023 Notes, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase 2023 Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and under the 2023 Notes.\nProvisions in the indenture could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the 2023 Notes and the indenture could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2023 Notes for cash, and we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate of the 2023 Notes. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2023 Notes and the indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us, or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us, to remove incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common shares may view as favorable.\nThe accounting method for the 2023 Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nThe accounting method for reflecting the 2023 Notes on our balance sheet, accruing interest expense for the Notes, and reflecting the underlying shares of our common stock in our reported diluted earnings per share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition.\nUnder applicable accounting principles, we record the initial liability carrying amount of the 2023 Notes at the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have a conversion feature, and is valued using our cost of capital for straight, unconvertible debt. We reflect the difference between the net proceeds from this offering and the initial carrying amount as a debt discount for accounting purposes, with the debt discount being amortized as interest expense over the term of the notes. As a result of this amortization, the interest expense that we recognize for the 2023 Notes for accounting purposes will be greater than the cash interest payments we will pay on the 2023 Notes. This will result in lower reported net income. The lower reported income resulting from this accounting treatment could depress the trading price of our common stock and the 2023 Notes.\nIn addition, because we intend to settle conversions of the 2023 Notes by paying the conversion value in cash, up to the principal amount being converted and any excess in shares, we are eligible to use the treasury stock method to reflect the shares underlying the 2023 Notes in our diluted earnings per share. In order to continue to apply the treasury stock method, we will need to consider on a quarterly basis our ability and intent to settle conversions by paying the conversion value in cash up to the principal amount being converted.\nUnder the treasury method, if the conversion value of the 2023 Notes exceeds their principal amount for a reporting period, then we will calculate our diluted earnings per share assuming that all the 2023 Notes were converted and that we issue shares of our common stock to settle the excess. However, if reflecting the 2023 Notes in diluted earnings per share in this manner is anti-dilutive, or if the conversion value of the 2023 Notes does not exceed their principal amount for a reporting period, then the shares underlying the 2023 Notes will not be reflected in our diluted earnings per share.\nIf accounting standards change in the future or we determine that we are no longer able or intend to settle the conversion value in cash up to the principal amount being converted, and we, therefore, are no longer permitted to use the treasury stock method, then our diluted earnings per share may decline.\nFurthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the notes are satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their 2023 Notes. This could materially reduce our reported working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions may affect the value of the notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2023 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that will initially underlie the 2023 Notes sold. We also entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge positions with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions, we believe that the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates entered into various cash-settled, over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and/or purchased shares of our common stock concurrently. In addition, we expect that the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates will modify their hedge positions with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions from time to time, and are likely to do so during any observation period (as defined in the indenture) for the 2023 Notes, by purchasing and/or selling shares of our common stock and/or other securities of ours, including the 2023 Notes, in privately negotiated transactions and/or open-market transactions, or by entering into and/or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock.\nThe effect, if any, of these activities on the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2023 Notes will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could, however, adversely affect the market price of our common stock and/or the trading price of the 2023 Notes and, consequently, adversely affect noteholders' ability to convert the 2023 Notes and/or affect the value of the consideration that you receive upon conversion of the 2023 Notes. In addition, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or to discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.\nThe hedge counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that they might default in the fulfillment of their obligations under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral.\nGlobal economic conditions have from time to time resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its various affiliates, as well as by Bear Stearns. If a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that hedge counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated with the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any hedge counterparty.\nConversion of the 2023 Notes or exercise of the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including noteholders who have previously converted their 2023 Notes.\nAt our election, we may settle 2023 Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. Furthermore, the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions are expected to be settled on a net-share basis. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the 2023 Notes, or the exercise of some or all of such warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the 2023 Notes, or such exercise of the warrants, could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2023 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2023 Notes could depress the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13410, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "SUPN"}
