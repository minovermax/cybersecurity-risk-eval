{"cik": "820313", "company": "AMPHENOL CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business, operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIf actions taken by management to limit, monitor or control enterprise risk exposures are not successful, the Company\u2019s business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock and debt securities could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks related to our global operations\nNon-U.S. markets form a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s business and as a result, the Company is more exposed to political, economic, military and other risks in countries outside the United States.\nDuring 2019, non-U.S. markets constituted approximately 69% of the Company\u2019s net sales, with China constituting approximately 28% of the Company\u2019s net sales. The Company employs approximately 90% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company\u2019s customers are located throughout the world and the Company has many manufacturing, administrative and sales facilities outside the United States. As a result, our financial results and our operations, including our ability to manufacture, assemble and test, design, develop or sell products, and the demand for our products, may be adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control. Because the Company has extensive non-U.S. operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the United States, it is exposed to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including:\n\u25cf instability in political or economic conditions, including but not limited to inflation, recession or slowing growth, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements, our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions, foreign currency exchange restrictions and devaluations, restrictive governmental controls on the movement and repatriation of earnings and capital, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u25cf intergovernmental conflicts or actions, including but not limited to armed conflict, trade wars and acts of terrorism or war; and\n\u25cf interruptions to the Company\u2019s business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions or cybersecurity incidents, inventory excesses, natural disasters or other disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or explosions.\nInternational trade disputes may result in increased tariffs, trade barriers and other protectionist measures that could increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce consumer demand or impede or slow the\nmovement of our goods across borders. Increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in some markets.\nChanges in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. In recent years, there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, in particular trade policies and tariffs affecting China. Some of these trade policies have been or are in the process of being renegotiated, including the U.S.\u2019s trading relationship with China. Changes to current policies by the U.S. or other governments could affect our business, including potentially through increased import tariffs and other influences on U.S. trade relations with China and other countries. The imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets, and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing. In addition, other countries may change their own policies on business and foreign investment in companies in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As a result of these dynamics, we cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.\u2019s trading relationships.\nIn addition to changes in U.S. trade policy, a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the United States and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, such as:\n\u25cf a global or regional economic slowdown in any of the Company\u2019s market segments;\n\u25cf postponement of spending, in response to tighter credit, financial market volatility and other factors;\n\u25cf effects of significant changes in economic, monetary and fiscal policies in the United States and abroad including significant income tax changes, currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures;\n\u25cf rapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation;\n\u25cf changes in government policies and regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which the Company currently operates;\n\u25cf industrial policies in various countries that favor domestic industries over multinationals or that restrict foreign companies altogether;\n\u25cf difficulties protecting intellectual property;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf credit risks and other challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, along with lower than expected investment returns and performance related to the Company\u2019s benefit plans;\n\u25cf the impact of each of the foregoing on outsourcing and procurement arrangements; and\n\u25cf continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration and tax and trade policies in the United States and abroad, including as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to withdraw from the European Union, otherwise known as \u201cBrexit\u201d.\nWe have significant international sales and operations and face risks related to health epidemics such as the coronavirus.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the country. This has affected our manufacturing facilities in China as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers\u2019 contract manufacturers. The extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, the coronavirus may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn\nthat could affect demand for our end customers\u2019 products. As a result, at the time of this filing, it is impossible to predict the overall impact of the coronavirus on our business and financial results.\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors or any other business partners.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees and agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws.\nWe have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing our directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements. Violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures. In addition, any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company\u2019s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways, including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold (thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency), cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company\u2019s worldwide operations, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has at times experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels.\nThe Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third party suppliers to secure these materials. Volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the Company pays for such materials. In addition, the Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn limited instances we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks related to our end markets\nThe Company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications and broadband communications.\nApproximately 44% of the Company\u2019s 2019 net sales came from sales to the communications industry, including information technology and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications, with 13% of the Company\u2019s 2019 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change. These markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. Furthermore, there has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical, quality, delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry. The Company\u2019s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 4% and 8% of the Company\u2019s 2019 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets, respectively. Demand for the Company\u2019s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, the Company\u2019s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the communications industry, the financial condition of operators and their access to financing, competition, technological developments, new legislation and regulation of operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease.\nChanges in defense expenditures may reduce the Company\u2019s sales.\nApproximately 12% of the Company\u2019s 2019 net sales came from sales to the military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs. The Company\u2019s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A significant decline in U.S. or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. U.S. and foreign government expenditures are also subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products.\nThe Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth.\nThe Company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25% of 2019 net sales. The Company\u2019s long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, manufacture and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. In the ordinary course of business, the Company continually develops or creates new product line concepts. If the Company fails, or is significantly delayed, in introducing new product line concepts or if the Company\u2019s new products are not met with market acceptance, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business.\nThe Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium- to small-sized companies. In addition, rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to acquisitions\nThe Company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses.\nThe Company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including nine in 2019. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy. From time to time, the Company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform as expected. The Company has also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business, including but not limited to: managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; maintaining and increasing the customer base; or retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors. In some cases, the Company may pursue indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of an acquired business for pre-acquisition liabilities, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants or for other reasons provided for in the relevant acquisition agreement. To the extent we pursue indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of any acquired business, such seller or sellers may successfully contest such claims, such seller or sellers may not have the financial capacity to compensate us for such claims or such claims may otherwise be difficult or impractical to enforce. Although we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of past or future acquisitions and investments, we cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, benefits and growth prospects will be achieved.\nThe Company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges.\nAt December 31, 2019, the total assets of the Company were $10,815.5 million, which included $4,867.1 million of goodwill (the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired) and $442.0 million of other intangible assets, net. The Company performs annual evaluations (or more frequently, if necessary) for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company\u2019s businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.\nRisks related to our liquidity and capital resources\nThe Company\u2019s credit agreements contain certain covenants, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Credit Agreement, as amended and restated effective January 15, 2019, among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and a syndicate of financial institutions (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), which also backstops the Company\u2019s U.S. commercial paper program (\u201cU.S. Commercial Paper Program\u201d) and Euro commercial paper program, contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the Company\u2019s operations, the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company\u2019s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the Company\u2019s credit facilities, the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the Company\u2019s other indebtedness and the Company not having sufficient assets to repay the Revolving Credit Facility and such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro commercial paper program of nil, $160.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.\nThe Company relies on the capital markets, and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions. If general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly, it could impact the Company\u2019s ability to access the\ncapital markets. While the Company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties, the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past. Market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments, acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases. As such, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, while the Company has not encountered any such issues to date, if the credit rating agencies that rate the Company\u2019s debt were to downgrade the Company\u2019s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the Company\u2019s performance, it would likely increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing and access capital markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. The Company monitors its mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, as well as its mix of short-term and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $400 million, or 11%, of the Company\u2019s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings. A 10% change in the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or floating interest rates at December 31, 2019 would not have a material effect on the Company\u2019s interest expense. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2020, although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on, and the market price for, our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion and details on this development.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 89% of the Company\u2019s outstanding borrowings were based on fixed rates and primarily related to the following unsecured Senior Notes:\nLegal and regulatory risks\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the U.S. government, including laws and regulations governing performance of U.S. government contracts, the use and treatment of U.S. government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products. We may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the U.S. government or its suppliers (both directly and indirectly), or become subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations. As a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations, we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions. For example, in August 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company\u2019s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government, as noted herein in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, Export Administration Regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the False Claims Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations and regulations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FCPA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the U.S. government without prior written notice, either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the U.S. government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the U.S. government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. We are also prohibited from assigning prime U.S. government contracts without the prior consent of the U.S. government contracting officer. Furthermore, the U.S. government periodically audits our governmental contract costs, which could result in fines, penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts. Any such fines, penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to governmental export and import controls.\nCertain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign sanctions and embargoes. These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current U.S. administration, especially in light of recent trade tensions with China. For example, in 2019, the U.S. government added certain of the Company\u2019s customers based in China to its \u201cEntity List\u201d, which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers. Although such restrictions did not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, the U.S. government has the power to place even greater restrictions on these and other customers, and such restrictions could prohibit the Company from selling products to such customers. If we were to fail to comply with these restrictions or applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for us, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nCybersecurity incidents on our information technology systems could disrupt business operations, resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations.\nCybersecurity threats continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. The Company has been a target of various cybersecurity attacks, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, but the impact of such attacks has not been material. Cybersecurity threats to the Company could lead to unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third party service providers. Cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations and the misappropriation, destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary technological information. Cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees, suppliers or third party service providers. Despite the Company\u2019s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures or other catastrophic events, any of which could include reputational damage, loss of our intellectual property, litigation with third parties and/or governmental investigations, among other things, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in May 2018, and the state of California\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective January 1, 2020, impose significant new requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect, process and transfer personal data by enhancing consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for non-compliance. The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with the GDPR, CCPA or other existing or proposed information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nChanges in fiscal and tax policies, audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company is also subject to tax examinations by various tax authorities and in addition, new examinations could be initiated by tax authorities. As the Company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world, the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur. The Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations.\nAny future changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting standards for income taxes and/or other tax guidance, including related interpretations, could materially impact the Company\u2019s current, non-current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, and consequently, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company relies on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain countries outside the U.S. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in national or international laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\nThe Company is subject to customer claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings.\nThe Company is currently engaged in, or subject to, various customer claims, litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future. Such matters expose the Company to risks that could be material, including but not limited to, risks related to employment disputes, tax controversies, government investigations, intellectual property infringement, compliance with environmental laws, unfair sales practices, product safety and liability, and product warranty and other contract-related claims. These matters may subject the Company to lawsuits, product recalls, government investigations and criminal liability, including claims for compensatory, punitive or consequential damages, and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expenses. These matters could also damage our reputation, harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand. While the Company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings, the policies may not respond in all cases and the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities. Any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company operates in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health, safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we manufacture and/or sell our products. Certain operations of the Company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. While the Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, the Company and its operations may be subject to liabilities, regardless of fault, for investigative and/or remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the Company\u2019s former or current properties, either owned or leased. Such liabilities could result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters. We cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise at any of our jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages and/or modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm, any of which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 84769, "SIC": 3678, "TIC": "APH"}
