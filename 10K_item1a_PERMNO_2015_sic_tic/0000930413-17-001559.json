{"cik": "795212", "company": "TRANS WORLD ENTERTAINMENT CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of certain factors, which could affect the financial results of the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by the availability of new products.\nThe Company\u2019s business is affected by the release of \u201chit\u201d music and video titles, which can create fluctuations in sales. It is not possible to determine the timing of these fluctuations or the future availability of hit titles. The Company is dependent upon the major music and movie producers to continue to produce hit products. To the extent that new hit releases are not available, or not available at prices attractive to consumers, or, if manufacturers fail to introduce or delay the introduction of new products, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by the continued declines in the physical video and music industries.\nPhysical media sales have suffered from the shift of content to digital distribution, streaming and online retailers (e.g., Amazon) that offer entertainment products at discounted prices and collectively have gained a larger share of the market. Physical video and music represent approximately 50% of sales and have been impacted by new distribution channels, including digital distribution, streaming and internet fulfillment. As a result, the Company has had negative comparable store sales for all periods presented.\nIf we cannot successfully diversify our product mix and implement our business strategy our growth and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nOur future results will depend, among other things, on our success in implementing our business strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our business strategy or that the strategy will be successful in sustaining acceptable levels of sales growth and profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may suffer if the Company does not accurately predict consumer acceptance of new products or distribution technologies or adapt to a shift to multichannel experience.\nThe entertainment industry is characterized by changing technology, evolving format standards, and new and enhanced product introductions. These characteristics require the Company to respond quickly to technological changes and understand the impact of these changes on customers\u2019 preferences. If the Company is unable to participate in new product or distribution technologies, its results of operations may suffer. Specifically, CD and DVD formats have experienced a continuous decline as digital forms of music and video content have become more prevalent. If the Company does not timely adapt to these changing technologies or sufficiently focus on the other categories, operating results could significantly suffer.\nIn addition, multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving with the increasing use of computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in stores and online and the increased use of social media as a means of interacting with our customers and enhancing their shopping experiences. If we are unable to adapt to the growth of multichannel retailing, and keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors, customer experience could be negatively affected, resulting in a loss of customer confidence and satisfaction, and lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nIncreased competition from existing retailers, including internet retailers, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company competes with a wide variety of entertainment retailers, including deep-discount retailers, mass merchandisers, consumer electronics outlets, internet retailers and independent operators, some of whom have greater financial and other resources than the Company and frequently sell their product at discounted prices or with added value.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s success depends on our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers. The retail business is highly competitive. In the past, the Company has been able to compete successfully by differentiating our customer shopping experience, by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, convenience, customer service and marketing efforts. Customer perceptions regarding our stores, our in-stock position and deep assortment of product are also factors in our ability to compete. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross profit and expenses. If we fail to continue to positively differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping malls in which many of our stores are located; any decrease in consumer traffic in those malls could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn order to generate customer traffic we depend heavily on locating many of our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls. Sales at these stores are derived from the volume of traffic in those malls. Our stores benefit from the ability of a mall\u2019s other tenants to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations. Our sales volume and mall traffic generally may be adversely affected by, among other things, economic downturns in a particular area, competition from ecommerce retailers, non-mall retailers and other malls, increases in gasoline prices, fluctuations in exchange rates in border or tourism-oriented locations and the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the malls in which we are located. An uncertain economic outlook could curtail new shopping mall development, decrease shopping mall traffic, reduce the number of hours that shopping mall operators keep their shopping malls open or force them to cease operations entirely. A reduction in mall traffic as a result of these or any other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business is influenced by general economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. General economic conditions impacting discretionary consumer spending include, among others, wages and employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. A downturn in the economy affects specialty retailers disproportionately, as consumers may prioritize reductions in discretionary spending, which could have a direct impact on purchases of our merchandise and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, reduced consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.\nDisruption of global capital and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources.\nDistress in the financial markets has in the past and can in the future result in extreme volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facility, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our credit facility is subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we were to borrow against our senior credit facility, a significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced declines and we may continue to experience fluctuation in our level of sales, results from operations and operating cash flow.\nA variety of factors has historically affected, and will continue to affect, our comparable stores sales results and profit margins. These factors include general regional and national economic conditions; competition; actions taken by our competitors; consumer trends and preferences; new product introductions and changes in our product mix; timing and effectiveness of promotional events and weather. The Company\u2019s comparable store sales may decline further than they did in fiscal 2016. Also, they may vary from quarter to quarter as our business is highly seasonal in nature. Our highest sales and operating income historically occur during the fourth fiscal quarter, which is due in part to the holiday selling season. The fourth quarter generated approximately 34% of our total annual pro forma revenue for fiscal 2016 (as discussed in Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report). Any decrease in our fourth quarter sales, whether due to a slow holiday selling season, unseasonable weather conditions, economic conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year. There is no assurance that we will achieve positive levels of sales and earnings growth, and any decline in our future growth or performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to open new stores or renew existing leases in profitable stores may limit our earnings.\nHistorically, the Company\u2019s growth has come from adding stores. The Company opens new stores if it finds desirable locations and is able to negotiate suitable lease terms for profitability. A lack of new store growth may impact the Company\u2019s ability to increase sales and earnings. During 2016, the Company opened 14 new stores and remodeled 11 under a new format and closed 29 stores with expiring leases. Likewise, the Company regularly renews leases at existing locations if those stores are profitable. Failure to renew these leases may impact the Company\u2019s earnings. See Item 2: Properties, for timing of lease expirations.\nA change in one or more of the Company\u2019s vendors\u2019 policies or the Company\u2019s relationship with those vendors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on its vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, the Company could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s purchases come from ten major suppliers. As is standard in its industry, the Company does not maintain long-term contracts with its suppliers but instead makes purchases on an order-by-order basis. If the Company fails to maintain customary trade terms or enjoy positive vendor relations, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIf the Company\u2019s vendors fail to provide marketing and merchandising support at historical levels, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe manufacturers of entertainment products have typically provided retailers with significant marketing and merchandising support for their products. As part of this support, the Company receives cooperative advertising and other allowances from these vendors. These allowances enable the Company to actively promote and merchandise the products it sells at its stores and on its websites. If the Company\u2019s vendors fail to provide this support at historical levels, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nParties with whom the Company does business may be subject to insolvency risks or may otherwise become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations to the Company.\nThe Company is a party to contracts, transactions and business relationships with various third parties, including vendors, suppliers, service providers and lenders, pursuant to which such third parties have performance, payment and other obligations to the Company. In some cases, the Company depends upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, including with respect to store and distribution center locations, merchandise, advertising, software development and support, logistics, other agreements for goods and services in order to operate the Company\u2019s business in the ordinary course, extensions of credit, credit card accounts and related receivables, and other vital matters. Economic,\nindustry and market conditions could result in increased risks to the Company associated with the potential financial distress or insolvency of such third parties. If any of these third parties were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, the rights and benefits of the Company in relation to its contracts, transactions and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or otherwise impaired. The Company cannot make any assurances that it would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as the Company\u2019s existing contracts, transactions or business relationships, if at all. Any inability on the part of the Company to do so could negatively affect the Company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nBreach of data security could harm our business and standing with our customers.\nThe protection of our customer, employee and business data is critical to us. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of all such data, including confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means, including deceiving our employees or third-party service providers. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. We have implemented and regularly review and update our control systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of customer payment card or personal information or employee personal or confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, harm our business and have an adverse impact upon our net sales and profitability. As the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the credit card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our retail operations.\nOur hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage, theft or intrusion that could harm our business.\nOur success, in particular our ability to successfully manage inventory levels and process customer transactions, largely depends upon the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory at the store level and aggregate daily sales information, communicate customer information and process purchasing card transactions, process shipments of goods and report financial information.\nAny failure of our computer hardware or software systems that causes an interruption in our operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales and profitability. Additionally, if any data intrusion, security breach, misappropriation or theft were to occur, we could incur significant costs in responding to such event, including responding to any resulting claims, litigation or investigations, which could harm our operating results.\nOur inability or failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or any claimed infringement by us of third party intellectual rights, could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, including proprietary software, are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could cause a decline in our revenue. In addition, any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us could be time-consuming to address, result in costly litigation, cause product delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or result in our loss of ownership or use of the intellectual property.\nLoss of key personnel or the inability to attract, train and retain qualified employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company believes that its future prospects depend, to a significant extent, on the services of its executive officers. Our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel. The loss of the services of certain of the Company\u2019s executive officers and other key management personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nIn addition to our executive officers, the Company\u2019s business is dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain a large number of qualified team members. Many of those team members are employed in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, health care costs and changing demographics. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members, our operations, customer service levels and support functions could suffer. Those factors, together with increased wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our workforce (none of which is represented by unions) could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. Examples of possible legislative changes impacting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer\u2019s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining units are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, health care mandates, and changes in overtime regulations\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ Global Market, as well as applicable employment laws. Additional legal and regulatory requirements increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in damage to our reputation, financial condition and market price of our stock.\nWe could be materially and adversely affected if our distribution center is disrupted.\nWe operate a distribution center in Albany, New York. We ship approximately 78% of our fye segment merchandise inventory through our distribution center. If our distribution center is destroyed or disrupted for any reason, including weather, fire, labor, or other issues we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes to reopen or replace the center.\nWe maintain business interruption insurance to protect us from the costs relating to matters such as a shutdown, but our insurance may not be sufficient, or the insurance proceeds may not be timely paid to us, in the event of a shutdown.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock.\nThe Robert J. Higgins TWMC Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) owns approximately 39.5% of the outstanding Common Stock. Therefore, the trustees have significant influence and control over the outcome of any vote of the Company\u2019s Shareholders.\nThe Robert J. Higgins TWMC Trust owns approximately 39.5% of the outstanding Common Stock and there are no limitations on the Trust acquiring shares in the future. Accordingly, the trustees have significant influence over the election of our directors, the appointment of new management and the approval of actions requiring shareholder approval, such as adopting amendments to our articles of incorporation and approving mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. Such concentration of ownership and substantial voting influence may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, even if a change of control is in the best interest of all shareholders. There may be instances in which the interest of the Trust may conflict or be perceived as being in conflict with the interest of a holder of our securities or the interest of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced and could continue to experience volatility and could decline, resulting in a substantial loss on your investment.\nOur stock price has experienced, and could continue to experience in the future, substantial volatility as a result of many factors, including global economic conditions, broad market fluctuations and public perception of the prospects for music and the home video industry. Changes in our comparable store net sales could also affect the price of our Common Stock. Failure to meet market expectations, particularly with respect to comparable store sales, net revenues, operating margins and earnings per share, would likely result in a decline in the market price of our stock.\nIn addition, an active trading market for our Common Stock may not be sustained, which could affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares and could depress the market price of their shares. The stock market has been highly volatile. For example, the closing price of our Common Stock at quarter ends has fluctuated between $1.65 and $4.00 from January 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017. Investors in our Common Stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nThe declaration of dividend payments or the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program may not continue.\nOur dividend policy and share repurchase program may be affected by, among other items, business conditions, changes in our business strategy, our views on potential future capital requirements, the terms of our debt instruments, legal risks, changes in federal income tax law and challenges to our business model. Our dividend policy may change from time to time and we may or may not continue to declare discretionary dividend payments. The Company\u2019s amended credit facility contains certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends or share repurchases, including limiting the amount of dividends to $5.0 million annually and not allowing borrowings under the amended facility for the six months before or six months after the dividend payment or repurchase of shares.\nAdditionally, although we have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, we are not obligated to make any purchases under the program and we may discontinue it at any time.\nThe failure to maintain a minimum closing share price of $1.00 per share of our Common Stock could result in the delisting of our shares on the NASDAQ Global Market, which would harm the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nIn order to retain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Market we are required by NASDAQ to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. Our stock price is currently above $1.00 and has been since October 6, 2009. However, in the event that our stock did close below the minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for any 30 consecutive business days, we would regain compliance if our Common Stock closed at or above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive days during the 180 days immediately following failure to maintain the minimum bid price. If we are unable to do so, our stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market, transferred to a listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or delisted from the NASDAQ markets altogether. The failure to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Global Market could harm the liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of etailz\nThe integration of etailz, Inc. with existing operations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn October 17, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of etailz Inc. (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d). The acquisition of a business and its integration with existing operations involves a number of financial, managerial and operational challenges that take significant management time and attention. In addition, we have incurred significant expenses and fees in connection with the Acquisition and may incur additional expenses post-closing. Our overall profitability would be adversely affected if our time and expenses associated with businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such acquisition.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we are expanding into a new market in which we have limited operating experience.\nWe have limited experience as a reseller on third-party ecommerce marketplaces. Our entry into this new line of business may subject us to additional risks and uncertainties. If etailz is not successful, it may not produce substantial revenue or profit and our operating results could be adversely affected.\netailz revenue is dependent upon maintaining etailz\u2019s relationship with Amazon and failure to do so, or any restrictions on our ability to offer products on the Amazon Marketplace, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\netailz generates substantially all of its revenue through the Amazon Marketplace. Therefore, we depend in large part on our relationship with Amazon for the continued growth of the etailz segment. In particular, we depend on our ability to offer products on the Amazon Marketplace. We also depend on Amazon for the timely delivery of products to customers. Any adverse change in our relationship with Amazon, including restrictions on the ability to offer products or termination of the relationship, could adversely affect the continued growth of our etailz segment and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties in fully integrating etailz into our business and may not fully achieve, or achieve within a reasonable time frame, expected strategic objectives and other expected benefits of the Acquisition.\nThe success of the acquisition of etailz will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities on a standalone basis and from the integration of etailz with our existing business. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in the integration of etailz with our own business, including distracting management from day-to-day operations and potential incompatibility of corporate cultures, and costs and delays in implementing systems and procedures. In addition, the process of integrating the operations of etailz could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel or vendor partners. Any one or all of these factors may increase our operating costs or lower our anticipated financial performance. Our failure to fully integrate etailz could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 10514, "SIC": 5735, "TIC": "KSPN"}
