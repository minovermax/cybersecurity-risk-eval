RISK FACTORS\nWe are substantially dependent upon CNH Industrial, our primary supplier of equipment and parts inventory.\nThe majority of our business involves the distribution and after-market parts and servicing of equipment manufactured by CNH Industrial. In fiscal 2016, CNH Industrial supplied approximately 71% of the new equipment sold in our Agriculture segment, 67% of the new equipment sold in our Construction segment, and 78% of the new equipment sold in our International segment, and supplied a significant portion of our parts inventory. Our financial performance and future success is highly dependent on the overall reputation and success of CNH Industrial in the agricultural and construction equipment manufacturing industries, including its ability to maintain its competitive position in product innovation, product quality, and product pricing. In the event that CNH Industrial decided to sell, or reduce its commitment to, its equipment manufacturing segments or if CNH Industrial would change its distribution system to our detriment, this would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, CNH Industrial provides to us the following:\n\u2022\nFloorplan payable financing for the purchase of a substantial portion of our equipment inventory.\n\u2022\nA significant percentage of the financing used by our customers to purchase CNH equipment from us.\n\u2022\nIncentive programs and discount programs from time to time that enable us to price our products more competitively.\n\u2022\nPromotional and marketing activities on national, regional and local levels.\nCNH Industrial may limit or decrease the availability of financing, warranty reimbursements, discounts and rebates, or other marketing incentives. Our financial performance will depend on CNH Industrial\u2019s continued commitment to these programs which enable us to effectively compete in the market.\nCNH Industrial may change or terminate our dealer agreements.\nWe have entered into dealer agreements with CNH Industrial under which we sell CNH Industrial\u2019s branded agricultural and construction equipment, along with after-market parts and repair services. Subject to applicable state statutes that may govern the dealer-manufacturer legal relationship, CNH Industrial may terminate our dealer agreements immediately\nin certain circumstances and, in some cases, for any reason 90 days following written notice. If CNH Industrial were to terminate all or any of its dealer agreements with us, our business would be severely harmed.\nFurthermore, CNH Industrial may unilaterally change its operating practices under the terms of its agreements with us to, among other things, change our sales and service areas, limit our product offerings, and change pricing or delivery terms. If CNH Industrial were to change the terms of our dealer agreements or its operating practices in a manner that adversely affects us, our business would be harmed.\nCNH has recently proposed a new format of its dealer agreement, to be applicable to all North American dealers. We have not commenced our negotiations with CNH in response to the proposed new agreement. We anticipate this process to commence within the next few weeks and be concluded in our second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOur dealer agreements with CNH Industrial impose obligations and restrictions on us.\nUnder our dealer agreements with CNH Industrial, we are obligated to actively promote the sale of CNH Industrial equipment within our designated geographic areas of responsibility, fulfill the warranty obligations of CNH Industrial, maintain adequate facilities and workforce to service the needs of our customers, maintain sufficient parts inventory to service the needs of our customers, maintain inventory in proportion to the sales potential in each sales and service geographic area of responsibility, maintain adequate working capital, and maintain stores only in authorized locations.\nConsent of CNH Industrial is required for fundamental changes in our ownership, governance or business structure, including the acquisition by another party of 20% or more of our outstanding stock. This requirement may have the effect of discouraging a sale or other change in control of the company, including transactions that our stockholders might deem to be in their best interests.\nThe acquisition of additional CNH Industrial geographic areas of responsibility and store locations in our Agriculture, Construction and International segments requires the consent of CNH Industrial under our dealer agreements. We can give no assurance that CNH Industrial will consent to any of the acquisitions of dealerships that we may desire to make in the future.\nOur agricultural equipment sales are affected by numerous market factors outside of our control.\nCyclicality is a common feature in farmers\u2019 capital expenditures. Increased capital investments typically occur during boom cycles spurred by high farm profits and increased farm wealth driven by increased farmland values. Farmers\u2019 capital expenditures are also affected by borrowing costs, with expenditures accelerated by low interest rates.\nNet farm income is subject to numerous external factors such as commodity prices, input costs, production yields, animal diseases and crop pests, currency valuation effects on exports of crop commodities, federal crop insurance and subsidy programs, and limits on agricultural exports/imports. Net farm income also impacts farmland values, which causes overall farm wealth to increase or decrease, impacting farmers\u2019 sentiment to make investments in equipment. The nature of the agricultural equipment industry is such that a downturn in demand can occur suddenly, resulting in negative impact on dealers including declining revenues, reduced profit margins, excess equipment inventories, and increased interest expenses. These downturns may be prolonged and during these periods our revenues and profitability could be harmed.\nOur construction equipment sales are affected by numerous market factors outside of our control.\nOur construction equipment customers primarily operate in the mining, natural resource development, construction, transportation, manufacturing, industrial processing and utilities industries, which industries generally are capital intensive and cyclical in nature. Many of our construction equipment customers are directly and indirectly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices in the agriculture, forestry, metals and minerals, petroleum and natural gas industries. The recent significant drop in the price of oil, as well as the price declines of other natural resource commodities, may cause reduced activity in these sectors, which will result in decreased demand for our products and services by our customers operating in these industries.\nConstruction contractors' demand for our construction equipment and services is affected by economic conditions at both a global and a local level. Economic conditions that negatively affect the construction industry, such as the tightening of credit standards which affect the ability of consumers to obtain financing, could reduce our customers' demand for our construction equipment. The construction industry in many of our geographical areas has experienced periodic, and sometimes prolonged, economic down cycles, which negatively impacts sales of construction equipment in those markets. During these downturns our revenues and profitability could be harmed.\nOur customers\u2019 ability to obtain affordable financing is an important factor in their purchasing decisions, and directly affects our business.\nThe ability to obtain affordable financing is an important part of a customer's decision to purchase agricultural or construction equipment. Tight credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets have the potential to adversely affect available credit for our customers. As net farm income has decreased in recent years, the borrowing capacity of our farmer customers may have also decreased. Moreover, in a tighter credit environment, agricultural lenders may discourage their farmer customers from making non-essential capital expenditures.\nInterest rate increases may make equipment purchases less affordable for customers and, as a result, our revenue and profitability may decrease as we manage excess inventory and reduce prices for equipment. Conversely, any decrease in interest rates may positively affect a customer's decision to purchase agricultural or construction equipment. We are unable to anticipate the timing and impact of interest rate adjustments.\nChanges in tax incentives may reduce demand for agricultural and construction equipment and cause our revenue to decline.\nOur customers in the agriculture and construction segments have benefited in recent years from Internal Revenue Code Section 168(k) accelerated depreciation, known as \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d, and enhanced Internal Revenue Code Section 179 expensing rules. Our customers may reduce their purchases from us if there are tax law changes reducing these benefits.\nChanges in governmental policies may reduce demand for agricultural and construction equipment and cause our revenue to decline.\nChanges in governmental agricultural policy could adversely affect sales of agricultural equipment. Government programs and subsidies that reduce economic volatility and enhance farm income positively influence farmers' demand for agricultural equipment. To the extent that future funding or farm programs available to individual farmers are reduced, these changes could reduce demand for agricultural equipment and we could experience a decline in revenue. Changes in government spending on infrastructure projects could adversely affect the demand for construction equipment and we could experience a decline in revenue.\nOur sales and profit margins may also be negatively affected by the final Tier IVB Final clean diesel emissions standards, which are now in effect. Tier IV refers to a generation of federal air emissions standards established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) that apply to new diesel engines used in off-road equipment. To satisfy these standards, manufacturers must introduce new cleaner diesel engines which will increase the manufacturing costs of the equipment. To the extent that our suppliers pass on these additional costs to its dealers, as expected, we will pay more for our equipment inventory. We may not be able to pass on these price increases to our customers and maintain our desired margins.\nOur financial performance is affected by general industry-wide supply levels of inventory, over which we have no control.\nOver-production by one or more manufacturers, or a sudden reduction in demand, can dramatically disrupt the market and cause downward pressure on our equipment profit margins. Short-term lease programs in the agriculture industry and rental companies in the construction industry have expanded significantly in North America in recent years. When this equipment comes off lease or rental fleet is sold, there may be a significant increase in the availability of late-model used equipment, which can worsen the over-supply condition and put added pressure on our equipment sales and margins, and have an adverse effect on residual values for our rental equipment and used equipment.\nWe believe that our industry is currently experiencing an oversupply of inventory, which has negatively affected our financial results, particularly our equipment gross profit margin. The oversupply of equipment in our industry may continue to cause downward pressure on our equipment margins, decrease our inventory turnover, increase our inventory financing costs, and cause us to write-down the carrying value of particular categories of aged equipment to reflect then-current market values. We cannot predict how long the current industry oversupply of equipment will persist, or how it may impact our operating results.\nOur financial performance is dependent on our ability to effectively manage new and used equipment and parts inventories.\nOur agricultural and construction equipment dealership network requires substantial inventories of equipment and parts to be maintained at each store to facilitate sales to customers on a timely basis. Our equipment inventory has traditionally represented 50% or more of our total assets. We need to maintain a proper balance of new and used equipment to assure satisfactory inventory turnover and to minimize floorplan financing costs.\nOur purchases of new equipment and parts are based in large part on projected demand. Our equipment orders from CNH Industrial typically must be slotted months in advance of actual delivery. If actual sales are materially less than our forecasts, we would experience an over-supply of new equipment inventory. An over-supply of new equipment inventory will generally cause downward pressure on our product sale prices and margins, decrease our inventory turns, and increase our floorplan financing expenses.\nOur used equipment is generally acquired as \u201ctrade-ins\u201d from customers in connection with equipment sales. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, each item of our used equipment inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. In a down market, our used equipment may not have the value that we attributed to it at the time of the trade and periodic adjustments to those values would be required in accordance with the lower of cost or market accounting principles. The amount of these write-downs of inventory are included in our cost of goods sold, and reduce our operating income. Our estimates of market value for our used equipment may prove to be inaccurate, given the potential for sudden change in market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Changes from our normal retail marketing channel to more aggressive marketing channels for specific pieces or categories of equipment inventory, particularly as equipment inventory ages, will generally cause a modification to our estimate of market value, which may result in a write-down of this inventory's carrying value. Reductions to our inventory's carrying value may result in a lower profit margin than previously expected. Further, pricing for and sales of used equipment can be significantly affected by the limited market for certain equipment.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks.\nWe are currently operating dealership locations in Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine, and also engage in export business to other countries. In fiscal 2016, total International segment revenues were 11.8% of our consolidated total revenue. As of January 31, 2016, total International segment assets were 10.5% of our consolidated total assets.\nOur operations in international markets subject us to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory environments and economic conditions present in the countries in which we operate. Risks inherent in our international operations include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in implementing our business model in foreign markets;\n\u2022\ncosts and diversion of domestic management attention related to oversight of international operations;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining import licenses;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of tax regulations, foreign laws and regulations which may be burdensome;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. laws that apply to the international operations of U.S. companies which may be difficult and costly to implement and monitor and which, if violated, may result in substantial financial and reputation harm;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed may adversely affect the results of our operations, the value of our foreign assets and liabilities and our cash flows;\n\u2022\npolitical or economic changes or instability.\nThese factors, in addition to others that we have not anticipated, may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current political and economic instability in Ukraine could create short-term and long-term disruption in our Ukrainian operations. The current instability is causing liquidity problems for certain of our customers which may result in credit losses on our outstanding receivable balances or cause our customers to delay or reduce their purchases of our products and services. Such reduced purchasing by our customers is causing our inventory levels to be higher than expected, contributing to increased carrying costs and reducing our return on assets. In addition, the current instability may affect our ability to secure new, or to continue existing, working capital loans at desired levels or cause such indebtedness to become more expensive. A reduction in borrowing capacity, absent associated reductions in inventory, could require us to make additional capital contributions to our Ukraine operations. Continued political and economic instability could also cause the Ukrainian government to impose additional currency exchange controls or to otherwise restrict our ability to recover and repatriate our investment in our Ukrainian subsidiary. The stabilization of Ukraine\u2019s economy and political structure will depend in large part on the assistance of the international community, which assistance cannot be assured. Absent this stabilization, our ability to profitably transact business in Ukraine could be adversely affected. Our operations in Ukraine are subject to the risks of further devaluation of the local currency, increased interest rates, and increased inflation.\nFloorplan financing for our equipment inventory may not be available on favorable terms, which would adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nWe generally purchase our equipment with the assistance of floorplan payable financing programs through CNH Industrial Capital and other credit facilities. In the event that our available financing sources are insufficient to satisfy our future requirements, we would be required to obtain financing from other sources. We may not be able to obtain this additional or alternative financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. To the extent that this financing cannot be obtained or obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our growth and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur level of indebtedness could limit our financial and operational flexibility.\nAs of January 31, 2016, our indebtedness included floorplan payable financing, long-term debt, and senior convertible notes. In addition, we have obligations under our lease agreements for our store locations and corporate headquarters.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes.\nWe expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations, debt service and capital expenditures. However, our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.\nThe credit agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain corporate and financial transactions, and require us to satisfy financial covenants.\nThe credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur more debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u2022\ntransfer and sell assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nissue equity instruments.\nOur credit facilities with CNH Industrial Capital and DLL Finance require us to satisfy a net leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio on an ongoing basis, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under our Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, in the event that excess availability plus eligible cash collateral is less than 15% of the total facility of $350.0 million, we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1. Our ability to borrow under these credit agreements depends upon compliance with these financial covenants.\nOur failure to satisfy any covenant, absent a waiver or amendment, would cause us to be in default under our credit facilities and would enable our lenders to accelerate payment of the outstanding indebtedness. Moreover, an event of default accompanied by a demand for accelerated payment under any of our credit facilities would also constitute a default under our Senior Convertible Notes. Each of our credit agreements include cross-default provisions which state that certain types of defaults under any other indebtedness agreement will also constitute a default under that credit agreement. If an event of default occurred, and the lender demanded accelerated payment, we may not be able to satisfy such a pay-off request, whether through internal funds or a new financing.\nOur variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.\nA substantial portion of our borrowings, including the credit facilities with CNH Industrial Capital, Wells Fargo and DLL Finance, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As such, our results of operations are sensitive to movements in interest rates. There are many economic factors outside our control that have in the past and may, in the future, impact rates of interest including publicly announced indices that underlie the interest obligations related to a certain portion of our debt. Factors that impact interest rates include governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in\nunemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Such increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment industries are highly seasonal, which can cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment businesses are highly seasonal, which causes our quarterly results to fluctuate during the year. Farmers generally purchase agricultural equipment and service work in preparation for, or in conjunction with, the spring planting and fall harvesting seasons. Construction equipment customers\u2019 purchases of equipment and service work, as well as rental of equipment, are also seasonal in our stores located in colder climates where construction work slows significantly in the winter months. In addition, the fourth quarter typically is a significant period for equipment sales in the U.S. because of our customers\u2019 year-end tax planning considerations, the timing of dealer incentives and the increase in availability of farmers\u2019 funds from completed harvests and construction customers' funds from completed projects. Also, numerous external factors such as credit markets, commodity prices, weather conditions, and other circumstances may disrupt normal purchasing practices and customers\u2019 sentiment, further contributing to the seasonal fluctuations.\nWeather conditions may negatively impact the agricultural and construction equipment markets and affect our financial results.\nWeather conditions, particularly severe floods and droughts, can have a significant adverse effect on regional agricultural and construction markets. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by adverse weather conditions.\nOur rental operations subject us to risks including increased maintenance costs if our rental fleet ages, increased costs of new replacement equipment we use in our fleet, and losses upon disposition of rental fleet units.\nOur rental fleet margins are materially impacted by utilization of fleet assets, which is seasonal and can fluctuate materially due to weather and economic factors. If our rental equipment ages, the costs of maintaining that equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. The cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs.\nWe include in operating income the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of rental equipment sold. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket prices for like new equipment;\n\u2022\nwear and tear on the equipment;\n\u2022\ntime of year that the equipment is sold;\n\u2022\nthe supply of used equipment on the market; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAny significant decline in the selling prices for used rental equipment, or increased costs resulting from our rental operations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and cash flow.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment distribution and rental industries are highly competitive and fragmented, with large numbers of companies operating on a regional or local basis. Historically, our competitors have competed aggressively on the basis of pricing or inventory availability, resulting in decreased margins on our sales to the extent we choose to match our competitors' pricing. To the extent we choose not to match or remain within a reasonable competitive distance from our competitors' pricing, we may lose sales volume. In addition, to the extent CNH Industrial's competitors (such as Deere, Caterpillar, and AGCO) provide their dealers with more innovative or higher quality products, better customer financing, or have more effective marketing programs, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf our acquisition plans are unsuccessful, we may not achieve our planned long-term revenue growth.\nOur ability to grow through the acquisition of additional CNH Industrial geographic areas of responsibility and store locations or other businesses will be dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable values, our\nability to compete effectively for available acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions. We may not successfully identify suitable targets, or if we do, we may not be able to close the transactions, or if we close the transactions, they may not be profitable. In addition, CNH Industrial's consent is required for the acquisition of any CNH Industrial dealership, and the consent of our lenders may be required for certain acquisitions. CNH Industrial typically evaluates management, dealer concentration, and performance and capitalization of a prospective acquirer in determining whether to consent to the sale of a CNH Industrial dealership. There can be no assurance that CNH Industrial or our lenders will consent to any or all acquisitions of dealerships that we may propose to acquire.\nOur acquisitions may not be successful.\nThere are risks associated with acquisitions of new dealerships. These risks include incurring significantly higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses; failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships; disrupting our ongoing business; diluting the effectiveness of our management; failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies; and impairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions also will have a significant impact on our financial position and capital needs, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.\nWe are exposed to customer credit risks.\nWe extend credit to our customers for parts and service work, and also for some equipment sales in our international operations. If we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. Delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions.\nOur business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees, including the managers of our domestic stores and our country managers in our International operations. The failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees will harm us.\nOur outstanding Senior Convertible Notes may cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may negatively affect our financial position and liquidity.\nOn April 24, 2012, we issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Senior Convertible Notes due May 2019 (the \"Senior Convertible Notes\") pursuant to an indenture between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \"Indenture\"). The Senior Convertible Notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holders under certain conditions. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of converted notes and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, for any conversion obligation in excess thereof. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the Senior Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe Indenture provides for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, cross acceleration to certain other indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries. In the case of an event of default, all outstanding Senior Convertible Notes may become due and payable immediately without further action or notice.\nIf we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy conversion obligations under the Senior Convertible Notes, our existing stockholders will experience dilution of their holdings of our stock. Repayment of the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash and, if applicable, satisfaction of our conversion obligations in cash may have a significant negative effect on our available capital resources and liquidity which may require us to borrow additional amounts pursuant to terms that are not favorable to us.\nIn addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Senior Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance of the Senior Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nSelling and renting agricultural and construction equipment, selling parts, and providing repair services subject us to liability risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nProducts sold, rented or serviced by us may expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of such products. Our product liability insurance may not be adequate to cover product liability claims. Such insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms. An uninsured or partially insured claim for which indemnification is not provided could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made against us or against CNH Industrial or any of our other suppliers, our business may be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to its effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are required to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and any remedial actions or their impact on our operations. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nAny disruption to or failure of our information systems may negatively affect our ability to monitor and control our operations.\nOur business processes, including marketing of equipment and support services, inventory and logistics, and finance largely depend upon the integrity of our information systems. Any disruptions to our information systems or the failure of such systems to operate as expected may adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm our business and financial results.\nOur policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, NASDAQ, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, privacy, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements.", "PERMNO": 92471, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "TITN"}
