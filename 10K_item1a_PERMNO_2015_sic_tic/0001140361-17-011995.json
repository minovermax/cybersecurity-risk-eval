We provide for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial condition and results of operations. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount recorded in our allowance for loan losses. In addition, we might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to repay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. Furthermore, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios. Downturns in the national economy and the local economies of the areas in which our loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions resulting in increased charge-off amounts and the need for additional loan loss allowances in future periods. In addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our primary regulators, the FDIC and the NCCoB, as part of their examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of the\nFDIC and/or the NCCoB after a review of the information available at the time of their examination. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to $6.5 million and $6.3 million, or 1.08% and 1.09% of total loans outstanding and 646.64% and 246.82% of nonperforming loans, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would decrease our earnings. In addition, at December 31, 2016, we had 84 loan relationships with outstanding balances that exceeded $1 million, all of which were performing according to their original terms. The deterioration of one or more of these loan relationships could result in a significant increase in our nonperforming loans and our provision for loan losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur commercial lending activities exposed us to losses in recent recessionary periods and our continued emphasis on commercial lending may expose us to future lending risks.\nOur emphasis on commercial mortgage, commercial construction and commercial land development loans exposed us to losses as the recent economic recession has adversely affected many businesses and developers in our market area. We are continuing to emphasize our commercial mortgage and commercial and industrial lending activities. At December 31, 2016, 31.9% of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties.\nAt December 31, 2016, our loan portfolio included $241.1 million, or 39.9% of total loans, of commercial mortgage loans, $27.8 million, or 4.6% of total loans, of commercial construction and land development loans, and $23.8 million, or 3.9% of total loans, of commercial and industrial loans. Commercial mortgage loans, commercial construction and land development loans and commercial and industrial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers, and in the case of commercial construction and land development loans, the successful completion and sale of the project. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Commercial and industrial loans also expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower\u2019s business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. In addition, since such loans generally entail greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable credit losses associated with the growth of such loans. Also, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan.\nA slowing or declining of national and local economic conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and in our primary market area. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, monetary supply, consumer confidence and spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and the strength of the economy in the United States generally and in our primary market area in particular. In recent years, the national economy has experienced recessionary conditions that have resulted in general economic downturns, with rising unemployment levels, declines in real estate values and an erosion in consumer confidence. Over the course of the past two years, the tourism industry in the Asheville metropolitan area has largely recovered, which positively impacted the economy in a number of our local markets, such as Buncombe and Henderson Counties, that directly benefit from this industry. The overall unemployment rate for December 2016 in the Asheville metropolitan area was the lowest of all metropolitan areas in North Carolina at 4.0% compared to 4.2% in December 2015, 4.0% in December\n2014, 5.0% in December 2013 and its recessionary high of 10.2% in February 2010. Buncombe County had the lowest county unemployment rate in North Carolina for December 2016 at 3.7%. Madison County and Transylvania County, which are located in our market area, continued to experience unemployment rates that exceeded the national unemployment rates. As of December 2016, the unemployment rate for Henderson County was 4.1%, Madison County was 4.8%, McDowell County was 4.6%, and Transylvania County was 4.9%, while the national and state unemployment rates were 4.7% and 5.1%, respectively. In addition, our primary market area is recovering from a softening of the local real estate market, that included reductions in local property values and declines in the local manufacturing industry, which employs many of our borrowers. While economic conditions and real estate in our primary market areas have improved since the end of the economic recession, economic growth has been slow and uneven, unemployment remains relatively high and concerns still exist over the federal deficit, government spending and economic risks. Future economic downturns, elevated levels of unemployment, declines in the values of real estate, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms. Deterioration in local economic conditions could also drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our allowance for loan and lease losses, which could necessitate increasing our provision for loans losses and reduce our earnings. Additionally, the demand for our products and services could be reduced, which would adversely impact our liquidity and the level of revenues we generate.\nDeclines in real estate values may cause us to incur losses in our portfolio of foreclosed real estate.\nOur portfolio of foreclosed real estate includes parcels of unimproved land, land with completed structures and land with structures in various stages of completion. We may have to incur additional costs to complete certain parcels of our foreclosed properties in order to market and sell the parcels, which may not fully recover upon the sale of the parcel thereby causing us to incur additional losses. In addition, although real estate values in our primary market areas have generally shown signs of improvement, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. If our local markets experience declines in the values of real estate, we may have to recognize further write-downs on our foreclosed real estate or incur losses when we sell our foreclosed real estate.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy.\nNearly all of our loans are secured by real estate or made to businesses in our primary market area, which consists of Buncombe, Madison, McDowell, Henderson and Transylvania Counties in North Carolina and the surrounding areas. This concentration makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets, such as the one that we experienced beginning in the latter half of 2007. Adverse conditions in the local economy such as inflation, unemployment, recession or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could impact our net interest income. Decreases in local real estate values could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure.\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our profits and investment securities values.\nOur net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our interest rate spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our borrowings. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our interest rate spread to expand or contract. Our liabilities are shorter in duration than our assets, so they will adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs will rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets,\ncausing our interest rate spread to contract until the yield catches up. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve\u201d-or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates-will also reduce our interest rate spread. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities are shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we will experience pressure on our interest rate spread as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. In addition, our mortgage banking income is sensitive to changes in interest rates. During periods of rising and relatively higher interest rates, mortgage originations for purchased homes can decline considerably and refinanced mortgage activity can severely decrease. During periods of falling and relatively lower interest rates, the opposite effects can occur.\nOur business strategy includes moderate growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOver the long term, we expect to experience growth in our assets, our deposits and the scale of our operations, whether through organic growth or acquisitions. However, achieving our growth targets requires us to successfully execute our business strategies. Our business strategies include continuing to diversify our loan portfolio by increasing our commercial and industrial lending activities and introducing new and competitive deposit products. Our ability to successfully grow will also depend on the continued availability of loan opportunities that meet our stringent underwriting standards. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to achieve our business plan, and our business and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could restrict our activities, have an adverse impact on our operations, and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies. The Company is subject to FRB regulation, and our Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by our primary federal regulator, the FDIC, and by our primary state regulator, the NCCoB. Also, as a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank must comply with applicable regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Board and the FHLB. Our Bank\u2019s activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable to our lending, deposit, and other activities. A sufficient claim against us under these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRegulation by these agencies is intended primarily for the protection of our depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of our shareholders. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. The Dodd-Frank Act and other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including, among other things, subjecting us to increased capital requirements, liquidity and risk management requirements, creating additional costs, limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could also result in heightened regulatory scrutiny and in sanctions by regulatory agencies (such as a memorandum of understanding, a written supervisory agreement or a cease and desist order), civil money penalties and/or reputation damage. Any of these consequences could restrict our ability to expand our business or could require us to raise additional capital or sell assets on terms that are not advantageous to us or our shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, such violations may occur despite our best efforts.\nThe final Basel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nIn July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by Basel III and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. This rule substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The requirements in the rule began to phase in on January 1, 2015 for the Company and the Bank. The requirements in the rule will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019.\nThe final rule includes certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to us:\n\u2022\na new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;\n\u2022\na Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from the former 4.0% requirement);\n\u2022\na total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% (unchanged from the former requirement); and\n\u2022\na leverage ratio of 4.0% (also unchanged from the former requirement).\nUnder the rule, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, common equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of instruments that previously qualified as Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital; except that the rule permits bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 Capital (but not in common equity Tier 1 capital), subject to certain restrictions. Accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) is presumptively included in common equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We elected to opt out from the inclusion of AOCI in common equity Tier 1 capital.\nIn addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. As of January 1, 2017, we are required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 1.25%, increasing by that amount 0.625% each successive year until 2019.\nIn general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in common equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.\nIn addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back our shares.\nThe federal banking agencies are implementing new liquidity standards that, while not directly applicable to us, could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business lines by forcing us to seek new sources of liquidity for them, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nIn 2014, the federal banking agencies adopted a \u201cliquidity coverage ratio\u201d requirement for bank holding companies with $250 billion or more in total assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposures and their subsidiary depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The requirement calls for sufficient \u201chigh quality liquid assets\u201d to meet liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. In 2016, the agencies proposed a net stable funding ratio for these institutions, which imposes a similar requirement over a one-year period. Neither the liquidity coverage standard nor the net stable funding standard apply directly to us, but the substance of the standards - adequate liquidity over 30-day and one-year periods - may influence the regulators\u2019 assessments of our liquidity. We could be required to reduce our holdings of illiquid assets which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The United States regulators have not yet proposed a net stable funding ratio requirement.\nIncreased and/or special FDIC assessments will hurt our earnings.\nThe recent economic recession caused a high level of bank failures, which dramatically increased FDIC resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the balance of the deposit insurance fund. As a result, the FDIC significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance. If such increases in the base assessment rate occur in the future, our deposit insurance costs may increase thereby negatively impacting our earnings.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nAlthough we consider ourselves competitive in our primary market area of Buncombe, Madison, McDowell, Henderson and Transylvania Counties in North Carolina and the surrounding areas, we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area.\nOur operational or security systems may experience an interruption or breach in security, including as a result of cyber-attacks.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could result in failures or disruptions in our client relationship management, deposit, loan, and other systems and also the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information. While we have systems, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe primary sources of our Bank\u2019s funds are client deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters, which could be exacerbated by potential climate change, and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include FHLB advances, sales of securities and loans, and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, as well as out-of-market time deposits. While we believe that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if we continue to grow and experience increasing loan demand. We may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets should such sources not be adequate.\nWe are exposed to a need for additional capital resources for the future and these capital resources may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments or to strengthen our capital position. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control and our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, our current shareholders\u2019 interests could be diluted.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits, the related income generated from those deposits and, in the event of branch sales or closures, losses from the sales of premises. The loss of these revenue streams, the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, we may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner, or rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected because we are exposed to conditions or assumptions different from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, included in this document, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that are considered \u201ccritical\u201d by us because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, such events or assumptions could have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe are exposed to the possibility of technology failure and a disruption in our operations may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our computer systems and the technology of outside service providers. Our daily operations depend on the operational effectiveness of their technology. We rely on our systems to accurately track and record our assets and liabilities. If our computer systems or outside technology sources become unreliable, fail, or experience a breach of security, our ability to maintain accurate financial records may be impaired, which could materially affect our business operations and financial condition. In addition, a disruption in our operations resulting from failure of transportation and telecommunication systems, loss of power, interruption of other utilities, natural disaster, fire, global climate changes, computer hacking or viruses, failure of technology, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity or other events outside of our control could have an adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and/or on our business. Our business recovery plan may not be adequate and may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations or substantial losses. The increased number of cyber attacks during the past few years has further heightened our attention to this risk. As such, we are in the process of implementing additional security software and assigning persons to monitor and assist with the mitigation of this ever increasing risk.\nNegative public opinion surrounding our company and the financial institutions industry generally could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion surrounding our company and the financial institutions industry generally, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and cybersecurity incidents, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (which we refer to as the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d) and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. Loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d may be protected from liability to a borrower for failing to make the necessary determinations. We have aligned our underwriting standards with the Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage rules and requirements issued by the CFPB. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers\u2019 ability to repay in accordance with CFPB standards, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve Board requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our Bank if the Bank experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.", "PERMNO": 13036, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "ASBB"}
