RISK FACTORS\nWhen evaluating our company, the following risks should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report. If we are unable to mitigate and/or are exposed to any of the following risks in the future, then there could be a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to economic, credit, business, and regulatory factors affecting the truckload industry that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe truckload industry is highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nEconomic conditions that decrease shipping demand or increase the supply of available tractors and trailers can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization, thereby decreasing asset productivity. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the US economy is weakened. During such times, we may a experience a reduction in overall freight levels and freight patterns may change as supply chains are redesigned, resulting an imbalance between our capacity and our customers\u2019 freight demands.\nWe cannot predict future economic conditions, fuel price fluctuations, cost increases, revenue equipment resale values, or how consumer confidence, macroeconomic conditions, or production capabilities, could be affected by armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, government efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements. Enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and numerous competitive factors could limit growth opportunities and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. The following factors could limit our growth opportunities and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations:\n\u2022many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain or grow profitability of our business;\n\u2022some of our customers operate their own private trucking fleets and they may decide to transport more of their own freight;\n\u2022competition from non-asset-based and other logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates;\n\u2022advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments; and\n\u2022our brand names are valuable assets that are subject to the risk of adverse publicity (whether or not justified), which could result in the loss of value attributable to our brand and reduced demand for our services.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\nIncreased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, decreased availability of new revenue equipment, future use of autonomous trucks, and the failure of manufacturers to meet their sale or trade-back obligations to us could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and profitability.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new equipment for our truckload operations. We have experienced an increase in prices for new tractors over the past few years, and the resale value of the tractors has not increased to the same extent. Increased regulation has increased the cost of our new tractors and could impair equipment productivity, in some cases, resulting in lower fuel mileage, and increasing our operating expenses. We expect to continue to pay increased prices for equipment and incur additional expenses for the foreseeable future.\nFurthermore, a decrease in vendor output may have a materially adverse effect on our ability to purchase a quantity of new revenue equipment that is sufficient to sustain our desired growth rate and to maintain a late-model fleet.\nWe have certain revenue equipment leases and financing arrangements with balloon payments at the end of the lease term equal to the residual value we are contracted to receive from certain equipment manufacturers upon sale or trade back to the manufacturers. If we do not purchase new equipment that triggers the trade-back obligation, or the equipment manufacturers do not pay the contracted value at the end of the lease term, we could be exposed to losses equal to the excess of the balloon payment owed to the lease or finance company over the proceeds from selling the equipment on the open market.\nWe have trade-in and repurchase commitments that specify, among other things, what our primary equipment vendors will pay us for disposal of a substantial portion of our revenue equipment. The prices we expect to receive under these arrangements may be higher than the prices we would receive in the open market. We may suffer a financial loss upon disposition of our equipment if these vendors refuse or are unable to meet their financial obligations under these agreements.\nDeclines in demand for our used revenue equipment could result in decreased equipment sales, resale values, and gains on sales of assets.\nWe are sensitive to the used equipment market and fluctuations in prices and demand for tractors and trailers. The market for used equipment is affected by several factors, including the demand for freight, the supply of used equipment, the availability of financing, the presence of buyers for export to foreign countries, and commodity prices for scrap metal. Declines in demand for the used equipment we sell could result in diminished sales volumes or lower used equipment sales prices, either of which could negatively affect our gains on sales of assets.\nIf fuel prices increase significantly, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur truckload operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, and accordingly, significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges.\nFuel is subject to regional pricing differences and often costs more on the West Coast and in the Northeast, where we have significant operations. While we use a fuel surcharge program to recapture a portion of the increases in fuel prices it does not protect us against the full effect of increases in fuel prices. Because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising. Our results of operations would be negatively affected and more volatile to the extent we cannot recover higher fuel costs or fail to improve our fuel price protection through our fuel surcharge program. Additionally, a shortage or rationing of diesel fuel, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks arising from doing business in Mexico.\nWe have growing operations in Mexico, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Trans-Mex, which subjects us to general international business risks, including:\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuation;\n\u2022changes in Mexico's economic strength;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and US export, import, business procurement, transparency, and corruption laws, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022changes in trade agreements and US-Mexico relations;\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\n\u2022theft or vandalism of our revenue equipment; and\n\u2022social, political, and economic instability.\nWe may not make acquisitions in the future, or if we do, we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy.\nHistorically, acquisitions were a part of our growth strategy. There is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. If we do not make any future acquisitions, our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected. Any future acquisitions we undertake could involve issuing dilutive equity securities or incurring indebtedness. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including:\n\u2022the acquired company may not achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flow;\n\u2022we may assume liabilities beyond our estimates or what was disclosed to us;\n\u2022we may be unable to successfully assimilate or integrate the acquired company's operations or assets into our business and realize the anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems;\n\u2022transaction costs and acquisition-related integration costs could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such costs are recorded;\n\u2022diverting our management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022risks of entering into new markets or business offerings in which we have had no or only limited prior experience; and\n\u2022the potential loss of customers, key employees, or driving associates of the acquired company.\nWe may not grow substantially in the future and we may not be successful in sustaining or improving our profitability.\nThere is no assurance that in the future, our business will grow substantially or without volatility, nor can we assure you that we will be able to effectively adapt our management, administrative, and operational systems to respond to any future growth. Furthermore, there is no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions or that we will be able to sustain or improve our profitability in the future.\nFurthermore, the continued progression and development of new business offering\u2019s are subject to risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022initial unfamiliarity with pricing, service, operational, and liability issues;\n\u2022customer relationships may be difficult to obtain or we may have to reduce rates to gain and develop customer relationships;\n\u2022specialized equipment and information and management systems technology may not be adequately utilized;\n\u2022insurance and claims may exceed our past experience or estimations; and\n\u2022we may be unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel and management with requisite experience or knowledge of our logistics services, and other developing service offerings.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our operating revenue is generated from a number of major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Refer to Part I, Item 1, \"Business\" for information regarding our customer concentrations. Aside from our dedicated operations, we generally do not have long-term contractual relationships or rate agreements or minimum volume guarantees with our customers. There is no assurance any of our customers will continue to utilize our services, renew our existing contracts, continue at the same volume levels, or not seek to modify terms of existing contracts. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\nRetail and discount retail customers account for a substantial portion of our freight. Accordingly, our results may be more susceptible to trends in unemployment and retail sales than carriers that do not have this concentration.\nIn addition, our customers' financial difficulties could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition, especially if these customers were to delay or default on payments to us. For our multi-year and dedicated contracts, the rates we charge may not remain advantageous.\nWe depend on third-party capacity providers, and service instability from these transportation providers could increase our operating costs and reduce our ability to offer intermodal and brokerage services, which could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and customer relationships.\nOur intermodal operations use railroads and some third-party drayage carriers to transport freight for our customers, and intermodal dependence on railroads could increase as intermodal services expand. In certain markets, rail service is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad. Intermodal providers have experienced poor service from providers of rail-based services in the past. Our ability to provide intermodal services in certain traffic lanes would be reduced or eliminated if the railroads' services became unstable. Railroads could reduce their services in the future, which could increase the cost of the rail-based services we provide and could reduce the reliability, timeliness, efficiency, and overall attractiveness of our rail-based intermodal services. Furthermore, price increases could result in higher costs to us, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers and could result in the reduction or elimination of our ability to offer intermodal services. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate additional contracts with railroads to expand our capacity, add additional routes, obtain multiple providers, or obtain railroad services at current cost levels, any of which could limit our ability to provide this service.\nOur logistics operations are dependent upon the services of third-party capacity providers, including other truckload capacity providers. These third-party providers may seek other freight opportunities and may require increased compensation in times of improved freight demand or tight truckload capacity. Most of our third-party capacity provider transportation services contracts are cancelable on 30 days' notice or less. If we are unable to secure the services of these third-parties, or if we become subject to increases in the prices we must pay to secure such services, and we are not able to obtain corresponding customer rate increases, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.\nOur future insurance and claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We self-insure, or insure through our captive insurance companies, a significant portion of our claims exposure. For a detailed discussion of our self-insurance programs, including self-insurance retention limits, please refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Higher self-insured retention levels may increase the impact of auto liability occurrences on our results of operations. We reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, and claims may ultimately prove to be more severe than our estimates. This, along with legal expenses, incurred but not reported claims, and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. Accordingly, ultimate results may differ materially from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that the amount of one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our coverage, we would bear the excess, in addition to our other self-insured amounts. Furthermore, insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses, including transportation companies.\nIn addition, rising healthcare costs could negatively impact financial results or force us to make changes to existing benefit programs, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees.\nInsuring risk through our captive insurance companies could adversely impact our operations.\nWe insure a portion of our risk through our captive insurance companies, Mohave and Red Rock. In addition to insuring portions of our own risk, Mohave provides reinsurance coverage to third-party insurance companies associated with our affiliated companies' independent contractors. Red Rock insures a share of our automobile liability risk. The insurance and reinsurance markets are subject to market pressures. Our captive insurance companies' abilities or needs to access the reinsurance markets may involve the retention of additional risk, which could expose us to volatility in claims expenses.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\nOur captive insurance companies are regulated by state authorities. State regulations generally provide protection to policy holders, rather than stockholders. These regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance, limit our ability to change premiums, restrict our ability to access cash held in our captive insurance companies, and otherwise impede our ability to take actions we deem advisable.\nIn the future, we may continue to insure our automobile liability risk through our captive insurance subsidiaries, which will cause increases in the required amount of our restricted cash or other collateral, such as letters of credit. Significant increases in the amount of collateral required by third-party insurance carriers and regulators would reduce our liquidity.\nIf we are unable to recruit, develop, and retain our key employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of certain key employees and we believe their valuable knowledge about the trucking industry and relationships with our key customers and vendors would be difficult to replicate. We currently do not have employment agreements with our key employees, and the loss of any of their services or inadequate succession planning could negatively impact our operations and future profitability.\nIncreases in driving associate compensation or difficulties attracting and retaining qualified driving associates could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and the ability to maintain or grow our fleet.\nDifficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified driving associates, independent contractors, and third-party capacity providers, could have a materially adverse effect on our growth and profitability. The truckload transportation industry is subject to a shortage of qualified driving associates. Such shortage is exacerbated during periods of economic expansion, in which there may be alternative employment opportunities, or during periods of economic downturns, in which unemployment benefits might be extended and financing is limited for independent contractors who seek to purchase equipment or for students who seek financial aid for driving school. Furthermore, capacity at driving schools may be limited by COVID-19-related social distancing requirements. Regulatory requirements could further reduce the number of eligible driving associates. We believe our employee screening process, which includes extensive background checks and hair follicle drug testing, is more rigorous than generally employed in our industry and has decreased the pool of qualified applicants available to us. Our inability to engage a sufficient number of driving associates and independent contractors may negatively affect our operations. Further, our driving associate compensation and independent contractor expenses are subject to market conditions and we may find it necessary to increase driving associate and independent contractor contracted rates in future periods.\nIn addition, we suffer from a high turnover rate of driving associates and independent contractors. This high turnover rate requires us to spend significant resources on recruiting and retention.\nOur arrangements with independent contractors expose us to risks that we do not face with our company driving associates.\nOur financing subsidiaries offer financing to some of the independent contractors we contract with to purchase or lease tractors from us. If these independent contractors default or experience a lease termination in conjunction with these agreements and we cannot replace them, we may incur losses on amounts owed to us. Also, if liquidity constraints or other restrictions prevent us from providing financing to the independent contractors we contract with in the future, then we could experience a shortage of independent contractors.\nOur lease contracts with independent contractors are governed by federal leasing regulations, which impose specific requirements on us and the independent contractors. In the past, we have been the subject of lawsuits, alleging violations of lease agreements or failure to follow the contractual terms, some of which resulted in adverse decisions against the Company. We could be subjected to similar lawsuits and decisions in the future, which if determined adversely to us, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are dependent on management information and communications systems and other information technology assets (including the data contained therein), and a significant systems disruption or failure in the foregoing, including those caused by cybersecurity breaches, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends on the efficient, stable, and uninterrupted operation of our management information and communications systems and other information technology assets (including the data contained therein). Our management information and communication systems are used in various aspects of our business. If any of our critical information or communications systems fail or become unavailable, it could temporarily affect the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. Our operations and those of our providers are vulnerable to interruption by\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\nnatural disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, internet failures, and other events beyond our control. Our business and operations could be adversely affected in the event of a system failure, disruption, or security breach that causes a delay, interruption, or impairment of our services and operations.\nWe receive and transmit confidential data in the normal course of business. Despite our implementation of safeguards, our information and communication systems are vulnerable to disruption, unauthorized access and viewing, misappropriation, altering, or deleting of information. A security breach could damage our business operations and reputation and could cause us to incur costs associated with repairing our systems, increased security, customer notifications, lost operating revenue, litigation, regulatory action, and reputational damage.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather and other catastrophic events could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability or make our results of operations and profitability more volatile.\n\"Seasonality\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, discusses in detail how seasonality and weather could impact our operations.\nOur business and results of operations have been and will be, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks, and such impact could be materially adverse, during the pandemic or after the pandemic subsides.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created, and any other outbreaks of similar contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments could create, significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. We have experienced an increase in absences among our driver and non-driver personnel due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Further, our operations, particularly in areas of increased COVID-19 infections could be disrupted. Negative financial results, operational disruptions, driver and non-driver absences, uncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, other similar outbreaks, or a recession, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, reduce credit options available to us, and adversely impact our ability to effectively meet our short- and long-term obligations.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has caused uncertainty in the economy. Risks related to an economic slowdown or recession are described in our risk factor titled \"Our business is subject to economic, credit, business, and regulatory factors affecting the truckload industry that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\"\nDevelopments related to COVID-19 have been unpredictable and the extent to which further developments could impact our operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain. Such developments may include the duration of the virus, the distribution and availability of vaccines, the severity of the disease, and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe, our drivers, and our equipment are regulated by the DOT, the EPA, the DHS, and other state and federal agencies in the states, provinces, and countries in which we operate. Future laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may be more stringent, require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, or require us to incur significant additional costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\"Industry Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, discusses in detail industry regulations that could materially impact our business, financial condition, and operations.\nReceipt of an unfavorable DOT safety rating or an unfavorable ranking under the CSA program could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and operations.\nIf we received a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating or an unfavorable ranking under the CSA program, it could lead to increased risk of liability, increased insurance, maintenance and equipment costs, and potential loss of customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\"Industry Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, provides discussion of the DOT safety rating system and the CSA program.\nCompliance with various environmental laws and regulations to which our operations are subject may increase our costs of operations, and non-compliance with such laws and regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; however, in the event of any of the following, we could be subject to clean-up costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations:\n\u2022we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances;\n\u2022there are releases of hazardous substances we transport;\n\u2022soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations; and\n\u2022we are found to be in violation of or fail to comply with applicable environmental laws or regulations, then we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\nCertain of our terminals are located on or near environmental Superfund sites designated by the EPA and/or state environmental authorities. We have not been identified as a potentially responsible party with regard to any such site. Nevertheless, we could be deemed responsible for clean-up costs.\nIn addition, tractors and trailers used in our truckload operations are affected by laws and regulations related to air emissions and fuel efficiency. \"Environmental Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, provides a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business and operations.\nDevelopments in labor and employment law and any unionizing efforts by employees could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough our only collective bargaining agreement exists at our Mexican subsidiary, Trans-Mex, we always face the risk that our employees will try to unionize. If we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with our domestic employees, the terms could materially adversely affect our costs, efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations. If the independent contractors we contract with were ever re-classified as employees, the magnitude of this risk would increase. \"Industry Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, provides discussion of labor and employment laws applicable to our business and operations.\nIf our independent contractors are deemed by regulators or the judicial process to be employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Carriers such\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\nas us that operate or have operated lease-purchase programs have been more susceptible to lawsuits seeking to reclassify independent contractors that have engaged in such programs. If the independent contractors we engage were determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, insurance, discrimination, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Furthermore, if independent contractors were deemed employees, then certain of our third-party revenue sources, including shop and insurance margins, would be eliminated. \"Industry Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report, provides discussion of legislation regarding independent contractors.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation. Recently, trucking companies, including us, have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal breaks, rest periods, overtime eligibility, and failure to pay for all hours worked. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial settlements or damages by the defendants.\nThe outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend litigation may also be significant. Not all claims are covered by our insurance, and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits, involve significant aggregate use of our self-insured retention amounts, or cause increases in future premiums, the resulting expenses could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nIn addition, we may be subject, and have been subject in the past, to litigation resulting from trucking accidents. The number and severity of litigation claims may be worsened by distracted driving by both truck drivers and other motorists. These lawsuits have resulted, and may result in the future, in the payment of substantial settlements or damages and increases of our insurance costs.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by the changing US and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs and adversely affect our business.\nThe approach of President Biden\u2019s administration to tariffs and other trade regulations is uncertain. The imposition of additional tariffs or quotas or changes to certain trade agreements, could, among other things, increase the costs of the materials used by our suppliers to produce new revenue equipment or increase the price of fuel. Such cost increases for our revenue equipment suppliers would likely be passed on to us, and to the extent fuel prices increase, we may not be able to fully recover such increases through rate increases or our fuel surcharge program, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if our capital investments do not match customer demand for invested resources, we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, or we are unable to obtain financing on favorable terms.\nOur truckload operations are capital intensive, and our policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts on capital annually. If anticipated demand differs materially from actual usage, our capital intensive truckload operations may have too many or too few assets. During periods of decreased customer demand, our asset utilization may suffer, and we may be forced to sell equipment on the open market or turn in equipment under certain equipment leases in order to right-size our fleet. This could cause us to incur losses on such sales or require payments in connection with such turn-ins, particularly during times of a softer used equipment market, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nIn the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, maintain compliance with financial and other covenants in our financing agreements, or obtain equity capital or financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our fleet size, enter into less favorable financing, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nCredit markets may weaken at some point in the future, which would make it difficult for us to access our current sources of credit and difficult for our lenders to find the capital to fund us. We may need to incur additional debt, or issue debt or equity securities in the future, to refinance existing debt, fund working capital requirements, make investments, or support other business activities. Declines in consumer confidence, decreases in domestic spending, economic contractions, rating agency actions, and other trends in the credit market may impair our future ability to secure financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nIn the future, we may need to obtain additional financing that may not be available or, if it is available, may result in a reduction in the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to:\n\u2022finance unanticipated working capital requirements, capital investments, or refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022develop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services;\n\u2022fund strategic relationships;\n\u2022respond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022acquire complementary businesses, technologies, products, or services.\nIf the economy and/or the credit markets weaken, or we are unable to enter into finance or operating leases to acquire revenue equipment on terms favorable to us, our business, financial results, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, especially if consumer confidence declines and domestic spending decreases. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our strategic initiatives, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance technology or services, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders may be reduced, and holders of these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders.\nIn the event of an economic downturn or disruption in the credit markets, our indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage in terms of our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.\nThis could have negative consequences that include:\n\u2022increased vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022cash flows from operations that are committed to payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing our ability to use cash for our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022increased interest rates that would affect our variable rate debt;\n\u2022potential noncompliance with financial covenants, borrowing conditions, and other debt obligations (where applicable);\nTable of Contents Glossary of Terms\nKNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.\n\u2022lack of financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022limits on our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, market conditions, or in the economy.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nAs detailed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, we must comply with various affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in default or (when applicable) cross-default. Upon default under our primary credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all outstanding amounts to be immediately due and payable, as well as terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross-defaults with our other debt agreements. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could use the collateral granted to satisfy all or part of the debt owed to them. If the lenders accelerated our debt repayments, we might not have sufficient assets to repay all amounts borrowed.\nIn addition, we have other financing that includes certain affirmative and negative covenants and cross-default provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants and provisions may jeopardize our ability to continue to sell receivables under the facility and could negatively impact our liquidity.\nWe could determine that our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles are impaired, thus recognizing a related impairment loss.\nWe have goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. We could recognize impairments in the future, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. If these events occur, our profitability and financial condition will suffer.\nIf our investments in entities are not successful or decrease in market value, we may be required to write off or lose the value of a portion or all of our investments, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThrough one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we have directly or indirectly invested in certain entities that make privately negotiated equity investments. In the past, the Company has recorded impairment charges to reflect the other-than-temporary decreases in the fair value of its portfolio. If the financial position of any such entity declines, we could be required to write down all or part of our investment in that entity, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 80987, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "KNX"}
