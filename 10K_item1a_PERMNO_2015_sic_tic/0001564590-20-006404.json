The statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nFinancial Risks and Risks of Operation\nOur revenues and the value of our hotels are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.\nThe performance of the lodging industry traditionally has been affected by the strength of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d). Because lodging industry demand typically follows the general economy, the lodging industry is highly cyclical, which contributes to potentially large fluctuations in our financial condition and our results of operations. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale and generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. In periods of economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce the cost of their trips. Consequently, our hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues during an economic downturn, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates. For instance, reductions in overall travel and reductions in travel to luxury and upper upscale hotels during the recession in 2008 and 2009 significantly affected our results of operations.\nOther circumstances affecting the lodging industry which may affect our performance and the forecasts we make include:\n\u2022\nthe effect on lodging demand of changes in national and local economic and business conditions, including concerns about the duration and strength of U.S. economic growth, global economic prospects, consumer confidence and the value of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nfactors that may shape public perception of travel to a particular location, such as natural disasters, weather events, pandemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as the coronavirus originating in China (see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - 2020 Outlook\u201d), and the occurrence or potential occurrence of terrorist attacks, all of which will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services;\n\u2022\nrisks that U.S. immigration policies will suppress international travel to the United States generally or decrease the labor pool;\n\u2022\nthe impact of geopolitical developments outside the U.S., such as the pace of economic growth in Europe, the effects of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, trade tensions and tariffs between the United States and its trading partners such as China, or conflicts in the Middle East, all of which could affect global travel and lodging demand within the United States;\n\u2022\nvolatility in global financial and credit markets, and the impact of budget deficits and pending and future U.S. governmental action to address such deficits through reductions in spending and similar austerity measures, as well as the impact of U.S. government shutdowns, which could materially adversely affect U.S. and global economic conditions, business activity, credit availability, borrowing costs, and lodging demand;\n\u2022\noperating risks associated with the hotel business, including the effect of labor stoppages or strikes, increasing operating or labor costs or changes in workplace rules that affect labor costs;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our hotels to compete effectively against other lodging businesses in the highly competitive markets in which we operate in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures;\n\u2022\nchanges in the desirability of the geographic regions of the hotels in our portfolio or in the travel patterns of hotel customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, hotel employee health care costs, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers; and\n\u2022\ndecreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks.\nWe cannot assure you that adverse changes in the general economy or other circumstances that affect the lodging industry will not have an adverse effect on the hotel revenues or earnings at our hotels. A reduction in our revenues or earnings because of the above risks may reduce our working capital, impact our long-term business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements. In addition, we may incur impairment expense in the future, which expense will affect negatively our results of operations. We can provide no assurance that any impairment expense recognized will not be material to our results of operations.\nIn addition to general economic conditions affecting the lodging industry, new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry\u2019s performance and overbuilding has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic downturn. Room rates and occupancy, and thus RevPAR, tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. A reduction or slowdown in the growth of lodging demand or increased growth in lodging supply could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.\nWe depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations.\nSince we have elected REIT status, Host Inc. must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) each year in order to qualify as a REIT. Funds used by Host Inc. to make required dividends are provided by distributions from Host L.P. Our ability to access external capital could be hampered by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nprice volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the U.S. and global equity and credit markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in market perception of our growth potential, including rating agency downgrades by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings;\n\u2022\ndecreases in our current or estimated future earnings;\n\u2022\ndecreases or fluctuations in the market price of the common stock of Host Inc.;\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates; and\n\u2022\nthe terms of our existing indebtedness which, under certain circumstances, restrict our incurrence of additional debt.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth and on our results of operations and financial condition. Potential consequences of disruptions in U.S. and global equity and credit markets and, as a result, an inability for us to access external capital at times, and on terms, reasonably acceptable to us could include:\n\u2022\na need to seek alternative sources of capital with less attractive terms, such as more restrictive covenants and shorter maturity;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on our financial condition and liquidity, and our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nhigher costs of capital;\n\u2022\nan inability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or\n\u2022\nan inability to execute on our acquisition strategy.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe lodging industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors are other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels, including other lodging REITs. Our hotels face strong competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business from major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands as well as from other smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators. We compete for customers primarily based on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Our competitors may have similar or greater commercial and financial resources which allow them to improve their hotels in ways that affect our ability to compete for guests effectively and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.\nWe also compete for hotel acquisitions with others that have similar investment objectives to ours. This competition could limit the number of investment opportunities that we find suitable for our business. It also may increase the bargaining power of hotel owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new hotels on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in our business plan.\nThere are inherent risks with investments in real estate, including their relative illiquidity.\nInvestments in real estate are inherently illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. For this reason, we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel that we desire to sell for the price or on terms acceptable to us, or the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close on the sale of a hotel. Therefore, we may not be able to vary the composition of our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions and dispose of hotels at opportune times or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders.\nIn addition, real estate ownership is subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations, including tax, environmental, zoning and eminent domain laws;\n\u2022\nloss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which it is located;\n\u2022\npotential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties;\n\u2022\nthe ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures in order to maintain or upgrade hotels;\n\u2022\nperiodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and property taxes, or an increase in the assessed valuation of a hotel for real estate tax purposes; and\n\u2022\nforce majeure events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or other possibly uninsured losses.\nWe have significant indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $3.8 billion. Our indebtedness requires us to commit a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs. Additionally, our substantial indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or\n\u2022\naffect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.\nIf our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we will be required to raise additional funds through:\n\u2022\nsales of OP units of Host L.P. or common stock of Host Inc.;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by Host L.P.; or\n\u2022\nsales of our assets.\nWe cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan. Under certain circumstances, we would be required to use the cash generated by any or all the events described above to repay other indebtedness.\nThe terms of our indebtedness and preferred OP units place restrictions on us and on our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and instruments that place restrictions on us and on our subsidiaries. For instance, the covenants in the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nexecute acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics;\n\u2022\nincur liens securing indebtedness, unless provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens;\n\u2022\nsell hotels without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on classes and series of Host Inc. capital stock and pay distributions on Host L.P.\u2019s classes of units without satisfying certain financial metrics concerning leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage; and\n\u2022\nconduct transactions with affiliates on other than an arm\u2019s length basis and, in certain instances, without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions.\nIn addition, certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial metrics. The restrictive covenants in the applicable indenture(s), the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt (including any mortgage debt we incur in the future) will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our indebtedness. For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see Part II Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition.\u201d\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate indebtedness and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or to sell assets.\nInterest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and the mortgages on certain non-consolidated properties are based on floating rates. As a result, an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 26% of our debt is subject to floating interest rates.\nRising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness when it matures and increase interest costs on any indebtedness that is refinanced. We may from time to time enter into agreements such as floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other hedging contracts in order to fully or partially hedge against the cash flow effects of changes in interest rates for floating rate debt. These agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our hotels, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of them as part of our business strategy.\nA portion of our long-term indebtedness, specifically $1 billion of credit facility term loans, bears interest at floating interest rates based on USD-LIBOR, which may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021, and it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected.\nOur expenses may not decrease if our revenues decrease.\nMany of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible. They do not necessarily decrease directly with a reduction in revenues at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally. Also, as of December 31, 2019, 22 of our hotels are subject to third-party ground leases, which generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments. Our ability to make these rent payments could be affected adversely if our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rent payments under the ground leases. For further information on our ground leases, please see Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report.\nAdditionally, certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. In the event of a significant decrease in demand, our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits. Our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates. Any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotels.\nOur acquisition or disposition of hotels may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.\nWe may acquire hotels through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar real estate ownership entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed with a combination of methods and a variety of sources of external capital, including proceeds from Host Inc. equity offerings, issuance of limited partner interests of Host L.P., advances under our credit facility, the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sale of hotels. Our inability to access external sources of capital may limit our ability to finance acquisitions. For a discussion of factors that may limit our access to sources of capital, see \u201c-We depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations.\u201d In addition, certain of these factors, such as disruption in the global capital markets, may limit the ability of purchasers to finance their acquisition of our hotels and therefore our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance our acquisitions.\nWe routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible transactions for acquiring hotels. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. Our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations. These adverse effects may occur because the performance of the hotel does not support the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition. In addition, hotels and entities that we have acquired, or may in the future acquire, may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers. In general, the representations and warranties provided in the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and to seek recourse against our sellers and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. The total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations, plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects, all of which may affect adversely our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. Finally, indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain limited liabilities relating to the hotels and entities acquired by us. While the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations, materiality thresholds, deductibles or caps on losses, there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers.\nWe also are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible transactions for disposing of certain of our hotels. Under current market conditions, based on our experience, we expect that any future sale of our hotels may be effected through any of several structures, including sale transactions involving portfolios or single assets, joint ventures with third parties and distributions of hotels to our security holders. We anticipate that any potential purchaser of our hotels may finance its purchase through a combination of methods, including cash or the issuance to us of its securities or those of one of its affiliates. Therefore, to maximize the value of hotels that we may in the future decide to sell, we may consider a range of transaction structures that we determine under the circumstances to be in our best interest. We cannot provide any assurances that we will successfully conclude any transaction to dispose of any one or more of our hotels or that the terms of any such transaction will maximize the value of hotels being sold.\nWe may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels.\nWe currently are, and in the future may be, involved in the development or redevelopment of hotels, timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing hotels, including the development of retail, office or apartments, and including through joint ventures. There are risks inherent in any new development, including:\n\u2022\nWe may not obtain the zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development. A delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive.\n\u2022\nAny new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs.\n\u2022\nDefects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a hotel to be closed during the period required to remedy the defect.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any indebtedness obtained to fund the new development, creating default risks.\n\u2022\nNatural or manmade disasters may delay construction or increase construction costs.\n\u2022\nRisks related to change in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization.\n\u2022\nThe development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential, fractional or interval ownership, increases in mortgage rates and/or decreases in mortgage availability, market absorption or oversupply, with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshare units for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we initially anticipated.\nIn addition, to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures, this creates additional risks, including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or will develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. See \u201c-We may acquire hotels in joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.\u201d\nAny of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners\u2019 ability to complete the developments on schedule and consistent with the scope that currently is contemplated, or to achieve the intended value of these projects. For these reasons, there can be no assurances of the value to be realized by us from these transactions or any future similar transactions.\nWe do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT, we are not permitted to operate or manage any of our hotels. As a result, we, through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotels. For this reason, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters. Although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans, the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters. While we monitor the hotel managers\u2019 performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. The cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name. Because our management agreements are long-term in nature, we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately.\nFrom time to time, we have had, and continue to have, disputes with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. We generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations. However, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations.\nIn addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees, to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest.\nFurthermore, our management agreements for our brand managed properties generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels, unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets other specified conditions. Our ability to finance or sell our hotels, depending upon the structure of the transactions, may require the manager\u2019s consent. Similarly, decisions with respect to the repositioning of a hotel, such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets, also may require the manager\u2019s consent.\nThe properties managed by Marriott International account for most of our revenues and operating income. Adverse developments in Marriott\u2019s business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us.\nApproximately 68% of our hotels (as measured by 2019 revenues) are managed or franchised by Marriott International. We rely on Marriott\u2019s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently, effectively, profitably and in compliance with the terms, responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Marriott\u2019s business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our hotels and could have a material adverse effect on us. See, for example, \u201cCyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers\u2019 or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business\u201d for a discussion of the database security breach disclosed by Marriott and its possible effects on our business and hotel operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.\nOur third-party managers are responsible for hiring, maintaining and managing the labor force at each of our hotels. We do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels (other than employing, but not managing, directing or supervising, the employees at our three hotels in Brazil). However, we remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted because of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs because of disputes involving our third-party managers and their labor force or other events. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, a significant component of our hotel operating costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. As we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement, we do not negotiate with any labor organization, and it is the responsibility of each property\u2019s manager to enter into such labor contracts. Our ability, if any, to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific hotel and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.\nOur hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, to maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. The timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.\nWe will need to make capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels, to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We also are required by our hotel management agreements, and may be required under future loan agreements, to make agreed upon capital expenditures to our hotels. In addition, the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance, particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels, such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. These capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays. In addition, because we depend on external sources of capital, we may not have the necessary funds to invest and, if we fail to maintain our hotels in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, they may terminate the management agreement. Moreover, we may not necessarily realize a significant, or any, improvement in the performance of the hotels at which we make these investments.\nA large proportion of our hotels are located in a limited number of large urban cities and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets, a natural disaster or the threat of a terrorist attack.\nHotels in the following cities and markets represented approximately 71% of our 2019 revenues: New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco, Boston, Florida, Hawaii, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. An economic downturn, an increase in hotel supply in these cities and markets, a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or similar disaster in any one of these cities and markets likely would cause a decline in hotel demand and adversely affect occupancy rates, the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and markets and our overall results of operations. For example, in September 2017, our operations in Florida and Houston were impacted negatively by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. In 2013, decreased U.S. government demand for hotel rooms (approximately 5% of our business) in markets such as Washington, D.C. had a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate, due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety. Hotels in major metropolitan areas, such as the major cities that represent our largest markets, may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety. The possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and, accordingly, the performance of our business and our operations.\nThe ownership of hotels outside the United States will expose us to risks related to owning hotels in those international markets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we own directly five hotels located outside the United States. We also are party to a joint venture that owns a non-controlling interest in seven hotels and an office building in India. Our international hotels accounted for approximately 2% of our 2019 revenues. We may have difficulty managing entry into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy, an absence of business relationships in the area, or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations. There are risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, which include:\n\u2022\nrisks of non-compliance with varied and unfamiliar employment laws and practices;\n\u2022\ntax laws, which may provide for corporate income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the U.S. and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated, directly or indirectly, are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions and which may affect our ability to repatriate non-U.S. earnings in a tax efficient manner;\n\u2022\ncompliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability, cost and terms of such financing;\n\u2022\nrapid adverse changes in local, political, economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain insurance coverage related to terrorist events;\n\u2022\nchanges of interest rates and/or currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation and difficulties in hedging these risks;\n\u2022\nregulations regarding the incurrence of indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndifficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with U.S. rules governing REITs while operating outside the United States.\nAny of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international operations. If we do not effectively manage and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may acquire hotels in joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.\nWe have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment opportunities. We may, from time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities owning hotels instead of purchasing them directly. We also may sell interests in existing hotels to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with the third party. Investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Co-venturers often share control over the operations of a joint venture. Actions by a co-venturer also could subject the hotels to additional risks as a result of the following and other unforeseen circumstances:\n\u2022\nour co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the joint venture\u2019s, interests or goals; or\n\u2022\nour co-venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives.\nFor certain joint ventures, we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners. Disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact hotel operations.\nAlthough our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow, in some cases they may be unable to distribute cash flows to the joint venture partners due to tax laws or other restrictions on our ability to repatriate non-U.S. earnings in a tax efficient manner. Additionally, in some cases our joint venture partners share control over distributions and may choose to retain capital in the joint venture rather than to distribute it. Because our ability to generate cash flow from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us, our failure to receive distributions from our joint ventures could reduce our cash flow return on these investments.\nThe growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business.\nA significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual or \u201ctransient\u201d customers are booked through internet travel intermediaries. Search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our hotels. If bookings shift to higher cost distribution channels, including these internet travel intermediaries, it could materially impact our revenues and profitability. Additionally, as intermediary bookings increase, they may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from the brands and hotel management companies managing and operating our hotels. Also, although internet travel intermediaries traditionally have competed to attract transient business rather than group and convention business, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business. If that expansion continues, it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and increase our cost of sales for group and convention business. Consolidation of internet travel intermediaries, and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business, also could divert bookings away from the websites of our hotel managers and increase our cost of sales.\nSome potential losses are not covered by insurance.\nWe carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption, cyber threats, terrorism and other risks with respect to all our hotels and other properties. In a limited number of instances, properties may instead be insured under the hotel manager\u2019s policies. As of February 2020, all consolidated hotels currently are covered under the company\u2019s insurance. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties. Generally, our \u201call-risk\u201d property policies provide coverage that is available on a per-occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit, as well as various sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub-limits exist for certain types of claims, such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs, landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits. The dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. In this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including California, Florida, Hawaii, Houston, New Orleans and Seattle, have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters and the applicable sublimits are significantly lower than the total value of the hotels we own in states where natural disasters are possible. Recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income. There is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or the income lost as a result of the damage. Our property insurance policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits provided in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage, any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the manager\u2019s program for the same purpose. Therefore, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. Each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. For example, if a hurricane were to cause widespread damage to Florida or up the East Coast, claims from each of our hotels would be aggregated against the policy limit or sub-limit and likely would exceed the applicable limit or sub-limit. We may incur losses in excess of insured limits and we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism.\nIn addition, there are other risks, such as certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage. We also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur, or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a hotel, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the hotel.\nFull insurance recovery for terrorist acts may not be possible.\nWe generally obtain terrorism insurance to cover property damage caused by acts of terrorism under separate standalone policies of insurance as well as policies on U.S. hotels which currently are subject to U.S. federal government cost sharing as provided in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (\u201cTRIP\u201d), which has been extended through December 31, 2027. We also have terrorism insurance under our general liability program and in our program for directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 coverage. We may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance policies for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts, and no U.S. legislation or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future.\nIn addition, insurance coverage for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (\u201cNBCR\u201d) perils is extremely limited. TRIP distinguishes between \u201cdirect insurers\u201d (those which write policies directly insuring commercial businesses) and \u201creinsurers\u201d (those which issue policies to direct insurers, absorbing some of the risk in the direct insurers\u2019 policies). TRIP requires direct insurers to offer terrorism insurance, except for NBCR perils, and most direct insurers have been unwilling to provide NBCR coverage, even with government reimbursement. TRIP does not require reinsurers to provide any terrorism coverage. Any damage related to war and to NBCR incidents, therefore, is excluded under our policies covering our U.S. hotels. Moreover, our foreign hotels also are not covered against NBCR perils. We obtain a certain amount of property insurance coverage on our U.S. hotels for NBCR perils through our wholly-owned subsidiary that acts as our direct insurer against such perils to the extent of reimbursement under TRIP. The U.S. Treasury Department must certify an event as terrorism, or no coverage will be forthcoming under TRIP. We ultimately are responsible for any loss borne by our insurance subsidiary.\nAs a result of the above, there remains uncertainty regarding the adequacy and cost of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of terrorist attacks that impact our hotels.\nCyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers\u2019 or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur third party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and customer information. These complex networks include reservation systems, vacation exchange systems, hotel management systems, customer databases, call centers, administrative systems, and third party vendor systems. These systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests, including credit card numbers and passport numbers. Our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels that we own and other hotels that they operate and manage, their corporate locations and at third-party owned facilities, including, for example, in a third-party hosted cloud environment. These information networks and systems have been and continue to be vulnerable to threats such as system, network or internet failures; computer hacking or business disruption; cyber-terrorism; viruses, worms or other malicious software programs; and employee error, negligence or fraud. These threats can be introduced in any number of ways, including through third parties accessing our hotel managers\u2019 information networks and systems. The risks from these cyber threats are significant and, as discussed below, Marriott International experienced a material data security breach involving the acquired Starwood guest reservation database.\n2018 Marriott Guest Reservation Database Security Breach. In November 2018, Marriott International disclosed its discovery of a data security breach involving the acquired Starwood guest reservation database. Marriott\u2019s investigation determined that there was unauthorized access to the database, which contained guest information relating to reservations at Starwood properties, on or before September 10, 2018 and that there had been unauthorized access to the Starwood network since 2014. Marriott disclosed that an unauthorized party had copied and encrypted information and took steps towards removing it. Marriott believes it contains information on up to approximately 383 million guests who made a reservation at a Starwood property. As of this date, Marriott has been named as a defendant in approximately one hundred lawsuits arising out of the database breach and also has been named as a subject of investigations in progress by various Federal, state and foreign governmental authorities.\nWe rely on the security systems of our managers to protect proprietary and hotel customer information from these threats. Any compromise of our managers\u2019 networks could result in a disruption to our managers\u2019 operations, such as the disruption in fulfilling guest reservations, delayed bookings or sales, or lost guest reservations. Any of these events could, in turn, result in disruption of the operations of the hotels that we own that are managed by them, in increased costs and in potential litigation and liability. All our major hotel management companies and a majority of our third-party operators maintain insurance against cyber threats. However, these policies provide varying limits and may be subject to sub-limits for certain types of claims, and it is not expected that these policies will provide a total recovery of all potential losses. In addition, public disclosure, or loss of customer or proprietary information, such as disclosed by Marriott in November 2018, may result in damage to the manager\u2019s reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of ongoing litigation and investigations by various state, Federal\nand foreign regulators, it is too early to determine the extent of the damage to Marriott\u2019s reputation because of the Starwood database breach and the level to which hotel guests may opt to book with other hotel companies because of security concerns for their personally identifiable information. Because approximately 68% of our hotels (as measured by 2019 revenues) are managed or franchised by Marriott, any material adverse effects to Marriott\u2019s ability to attract and retain hotel guests will have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels, we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access, store, transmit, and manage or support a variety of our business processes. There can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures, inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers. Disruptions in service, system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and systems we use, including unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial reporting and compliance, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, which amounts could be significant.\nWe currently maintain cyber insurance, which includes coverage for third-party liability (damages and settlements to third parties) and first-party loss (costs incurred by us in response to a network security or privacy event). Third-party coverages include defense and damages for alleged libel and slander in electronic media, privacy breach liability and related fines and penalties assessed by regulators. First-party coverages include costs incurred by us in remediating a network security event, loss of income/extra expense due to loss of use of computer systems, costs of data recovery, and cyber extortion. This policy also includes excess coverage for most of our smaller, independent hotel operators, who generally carry lower coverage limits than our major operators, in the event that the insurance carried by these smaller, independent operators is insufficient to cover cyber related damages relating to hotel operations. However, as with the operator\u2019s coverage, our policy is subject to limits and sub-limits for certain types of claims and we do not expect that this policy will cover all the losses that we could experience from these exposures.\nLitigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and are defending these claims vigorously; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any period, depending, in part, upon the quantum of our operating results for such period. We also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nWe have approximately 175 employees and our continued success depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel. None of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers. These individuals are important to our business and strategy and to the extent that any of them departs and is not replaced with a qualified substitute, such person\u2019s departure could have a significant adverse effect our operations and financial condition.\nExchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position. We generate revenues and expenses in such foreign currencies as the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real and the Indian rupee. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies, these transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate entirely that risk. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in that same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies, the conversion of such amounts to U.S. dollars can result in an increase or decrease of the amount of our revenues or earnings because of exchange rate fluctuations.\nSimilarly, changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar can result in increases or decreases in demand at our U.S. hotels from international travelers coming to the United States. Because of the concentration of our hotels in major U.S. cities with large numbers of international travelers to the United States, we may have more exposure to fluctuations in international travel to the United States than other lodging companies without hotels located as heavily in these markets.\nApplicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities.\nAs a REIT, each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT is subject to various restrictions on the types of revenues it can earn, assets it can own and activities in which it can engage. Business activities that could be restricted by applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, developing alternative uses of real estate and the ownership of hotels that are not leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary (\u201cTRS\u201d), including the development and/or sale of timeshare or condominium units or the related land parcels. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will continue to conduct certain business activities, including, but not limited to, those mentioned above, in one or more of our TRS. Our TRS are taxable as regular C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income.\nEnvironmental problems are possible and can be costly.\nOur hotels are subject to requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Unidentified environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Additionally, even after we have sold a hotel, we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials.\nWe face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which can include more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations and business. Over time, our coastal markets are expected to experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels causing damage to our hotels. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those hotels to additional regulatory burdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards. Climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs at our hotels, such as the cost of water or energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our hotels against such risks. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations or business.\nCompliance with other government regulations can be costly.\nOur hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible. In addition, we have committed to provide, and certain local laws and contracts between our hotel managers and the hotel workers\u2019 union require our hotels to provide, our managers\u2019 employees with safety devices, sometimes known as \u201cpanic buttons.\u201d We fund the capital necessary to ensure that employees at our hotels will be equipped with these safety devices. These and other laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the Justice Department, or an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to private litigants. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. Any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the operations of our foreign hotels are subject to a variety of United States and international laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). We have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our foreign hotels might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nRisks of Ownership of Host Inc.\u2019s Common Stock\nThere are limitations on the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock and changes in control.\nHost Inc.\u2019s charter and by-laws, the partnership agreement of Host L.P., and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Host Inc.\u2019s stockholders or Host L.P.\u2019s unitholders, including the following:\n\u2022\nRestrictions on transfer and ownership of Host Inc.\u2019s stock. To maintain Host Inc.\u2019s qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of Host Inc.\u2019s outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the last half of the taxable year, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, which, as defined in the Code, may include certain entities. Accordingly, Host Inc.\u2019s charter prohibits ownership, directly or by attribution, by any person or persons acting as a group, of more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of Host Inc.\u2019s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other class or series of stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose. Together, these limitations are referred to as the \u201cownership limit.\u201d\nStock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon, to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares of Host Inc.\u2019s stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances, and, in any event, would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of Host Inc.\u2019s stock in excess of the ownership limit. These restrictions will not apply if Host Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors determines that it no longer is in Host Inc.\u2019s best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership no longer is required for Host Inc. to qualify as a REIT.\n\u2022\nRemoval of members of the Board of Directors. Host Inc.\u2019s charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Vacancies on Host Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors, except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire Board of Directors. Any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.\n\u2022\nPreferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval. Host Inc.\u2019s charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that Host Inc. has authority to issue is 1,100,000,000, consisting of 1,050,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Host Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock, and to establish the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Because Host Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors has this power, it may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms, preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.\n\u2022\nCertain provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of Host Inc. Certain provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from acquiring Host Inc., including:\no\n\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation\u2019s then outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation) or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and\no\n\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of a corporation (defined as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nHost Inc. is subject to the Maryland business combination statute. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the MGCL. There can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.\n\u2022\nMerger, consolidation, share exchange and transfer of Host Inc.\u2019s assets. Under Maryland law and Host Inc.\u2019s charter, subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock, we can merge with or into another entity, convert, consolidate with one or more other entities, participate in a share exchange or transfer Host Inc.\u2019s assets within the meaning of the MGCL if approved (1) by Host Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors in the manner provided in the MGCL, and (2) by Host Inc.\u2019s stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except that any merger of Host Inc. with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing Host Inc.\u2019s form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of Host Inc.\u2019s stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger. Under the MGCL, specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required to be approved by the board of directors of a Maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity. Host Inc.\u2019s voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\n\u2022\nCertain charter amendments. Host Inc.\u2019s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of Host Inc.\u2019s stock, fixing the size of the Board of Directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors, the filling of vacancies, exculpation and indemnification of directors, calling special stockholder meetings and others, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by Host Inc.\u2019s stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Other charter amendments generally require approval of the Board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. These provisions may make it more difficult to amend Host Inc.\u2019s charter to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock, without the approval of the Board of Directors.\nShares of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock.\nWe have in the past issued and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, refinance debt or for other corporate purposes. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could affect adversely prevailing market prices for Host Inc.\u2019s common stock. In addition, limited partners of Host L.P. who redeem their units and receive, at Host Inc.\u2019s election, shares of Host Inc. common stock will be able to sell those shares freely. As of December 31, 2019, there are approximately 7.5 million Host LP OP units outstanding that are owned by third parties and are redeemable, which represents approximately 1% of all outstanding OP units. Further, shares of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans.\nOur earnings and cash dividends will affect the market price of shares of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock.\nWe believe that the market value of a REIT\u2019s equity securities is based primarily upon the market\u2019s perception of the REIT\u2019s growth potential and its current and potential future cash dividends, whether from operations, sales, acquisitions, development or refinancing, and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than its net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, rather than paying dividends using such cash flow to stockholders, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may impact negatively the market price of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock. Our failure to meet the market\u2019s expectation of future earnings and cash dividends likely would affect adversely the market price of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock.\nFederal Income Tax Risks\nAdverse tax consequences would occur if Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT.\nWe believe that Host Inc. has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, commencing with its taxable year beginning January 1, 1999, and Host Inc. currently intends to continue to operate as a REIT during future years. In addition, Host Inc. owns, through Host L.P., one entity that also has elected to be treated as a REIT. As the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a REIT are limited, no assurance can be provided that Host Inc. currently qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT or that Host Inc.\u2019s subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT. If our subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that Host Inc. would fail to qualify as a REIT unless it (or the subsidiary REIT) could avail itself of certain relief provisions. If Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income. Any such corporate income tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the non-qualifying REIT\u2019s cash available for, among other things, operations and dividends to its stockholders. In addition, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it would not be required to pay dividends to its stockholders. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT could not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.\nTo qualify as a REIT, Host Inc. is required to satisfy the requirements of several asset and gross income tests. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which assets are not susceptible to a precise determination of fair market value, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT asset and gross income tests requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our gross income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) will not contend that our hotel leases, interests in subsidiaries, or interests in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT gross income and asset tests requirements.\nAny determination that Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT does not qualify as a REIT will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock. The additional corporate income tax liability of Host Inc. or the subsidiary REIT for the year, or years, in which it does not qualify as a REIT would reduce its cash flow available for investment, debt service or dividends to stockholders. Furthermore, the entity not qualifying as a REIT no longer would be required to pay dividends to its stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification, and any dividends paid to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary C corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, Host Inc.\u2019s stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on dividends at capital gain tax rates and Host Inc.\u2019s corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case to applicable limitations under the Code. Host Inc.\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under Host L.P.\u2019s credit facility, which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under Host L.P.\u2019s outstanding debt securities.\nIf our hotel managers do not qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors,\u201d or if our hotels are not \u201cqualified lodging facilities,\u201d Host Inc. will fail to qualify as a REIT.\nEach hotel with respect to which our TRS pays rent must be a \u201cqualified lodging facility.\u201d A \u201cqualified lodging facility\u201d is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. We believe that all the hotels leased to our TRS are qualified lodging facilities. However, the REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations of whether a hotel is considered a qualified lodging facility, and there can be no assurance that our hotels will be so considered in all cases.\nIf our hotel managers do not qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors,\u201d Host Inc. and our subsidiary REIT likely will fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our TRS must qualify as an \u201celigible independent contractor\u201d under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid to Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT by our TRS to be qualifying gross income for the REIT gross income tests requirements. Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, a hotel manager cannot own more than 35% of our outstanding shares (by value) and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager, taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded, only owners of more than 5% of such ownership interests. Complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35% ownership thresholds. Although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners, and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules, there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded.\nThe size of our TRS is limited and our transactions with our TRS will cause us to be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain income or deductions if such transactions are not conducted on arm\u2019s-length terms.\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the equity interests of an entity that is a C corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a TRS. A TRS may own assets and earn gross income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying gross income if owned or earned directly by a REIT, including revenues from hotel operations. Both the REIT and its C corporation subsidiary must jointly elect to treat such C corporation subsidiary as a TRS. A C corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of its stock or securities automatically will be treated as a TRS. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) of the value of a REIT\u2019s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS. Beginning in 2018, a TRS may be eligible to elect out of new interest expense limitation rules enacted in December 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOur TRS will pay federal corporate income tax and applicable state and local corporate income tax and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax on its taxable income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21% effective January 1, 2018. The after-tax net income of our TRS will be available for distribution to us as a taxable dividend to the extent of its earnings and profits, but it is not required to be so distributed. We believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our TRS has been and will continue to be less than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets (including our TRS stock and securities). Furthermore, we monitor the value of our investments in our TRS for the purpose of ensuring compliance with TRS ownership limitations. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) value limitation discussed above.\nRent paid to Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT by our TRS cannot be based on its net income or profits for such rents to qualify as \u201crent from real property.\u201d We receive \u201cpercentage rent\u201d from our TRS that is calculated based on the gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases - not based on net income or profits of such hotels. If the IRS determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with our TRS are excessive, the deductibility thereof by the TRS may be challenged, and we could be subject to a 100% excise tax on \u201cre-determined rent\u201d or \u201cre-determined deductions\u201d to the extent that such rent exceeds an arm\u2019s-length amount. We believe that our rent and other transactions between our REITs and their TRS are based on arm\u2019s-length amounts and reflect normal business practices, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our belief.\nDespite the REIT status of each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT, we remain subject to various taxes.\nNotwithstanding Host Inc.\u2019s status as a REIT, Host Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (including our subsidiary REIT) are subject to federal, state, local and foreign corporate taxes on their net income, gross receipts, net worth, and property, in certain cases. Host L.P. is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host Inc.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum tax rate applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d payable by U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for these reduced rates. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or as qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally a reduction to 29.6% assuming the stockholder is subject to the maximum individual income tax rate of 37%), such tax rate still is higher than the tax rate applicable to C corporation dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT C corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.\nNew legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entity\u2019s qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of its REIT qualification. If Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT could not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders. Changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could affect us and our stockholders include:\n\u2022\ntemporarily reducing individual U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual U.S. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;\n\u2022\npermanently eliminating the progressive corporate income tax rate structure, which previously imposed a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017;\n\u2022\npermitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or as qualified dividend income, which will allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026;\n\u2022\nreducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests from 35% to 21%;\n\u2022\nlimiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of our REIT taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction);\n\u2022\ngenerally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business\u2019s \u201cadjusted taxable income,\u201d except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses (including most equity REITs) and that elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods); and\n\u2022\neliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.\nMany of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and IRS, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation. Proposed regulations have been issued with respect to many of these law changes, but the regulations, once finalized, could be much different from those proposed. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. While some of the changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may adversely affect the Company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial.\nRisks Relating to Redemption of OP Units\nA holder who offers its OP units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences.\nA limited partner who elects to redeem its OP units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the OP units. The sale of these OP units is a taxable event and the limited partner will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of (1) the value of the common stock or cash it receives, and (2) the amount of the qualified nonrecourse liabilities of Host L.P. allocated to the redeemed OP units. The gain or loss recognized by the limited partner is measured by the difference between the amount realized thereby and the tax basis in the OP units redeemed (which tax basis includes the amount of the qualified nonrecourse liabilities of Host L.P. allocated to the redeemed OP units). It is possible that the amount of gain and/or the tax liability related thereto that the limited partner recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash received.\nDifferences between an investment in shares of Host Inc. common stock and Host L.P. OP units may affect redeemed limited partners.\nIf a limited partner elects to redeem its OP units, we will determine whether such limited partner receives cash or shares of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock in exchange for the OP units. Although an investment in shares of Host Inc.\u2019s common stock is substantially similar to an investment in Host L.P. OP units, there are some differences. These differences include form of organization, management structure, voting rights, liquidity and federal and state income taxation, some of which differences may be material to investors.", "PERMNO": 46703, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "HST"}
