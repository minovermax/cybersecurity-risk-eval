RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.\n\ufeff\nNatural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices greatly affect our business, including our revenues, profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets.\n\ufeff\nOur revenues, profitability, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets greatly depend on prices for natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids. The markets for these commodities have been volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue. The prices of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand (global, regional and local), transportation costs, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control. Short- and long-term prices are subject to a myriad of factors such as:\n\u2022 overall demand, including the relative cost of competing sources of energy or fuel;\n\u2022 overall supply, including costs of production;\n\u2022 the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and gathering, processing and storage facilities;\n\u2022 regional basis differentials;\n\u2022 national and worldwide economic and political conditions;\n\u2022 weather conditions and seasonal trends;\n\u2022 government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls;\n\u2022 inventory levels; and\n\u2022 market perceptions of future prices, whether due to the foregoing factors or others.\n\ufeff\nFor example, in 2016 and 2015, our production was approximately 90% and 92% natural gas, respectively, and during this period spot prices ranged from a low of $1.49 per Mcf in March 2016 to a high of $3.80 per Mcf in December 2016.\n\ufeff\nIn our exploration and production business, lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices directly reduce our revenues and thus our operating income and cash flow. Lower prices also reduce the projected profitability of further drilling and therefore are likely to reduce our drilling activity, which in turn means we will have fewer wells on production in the future. Lower prices also reduce the value of our assets, both by a direct reduction in what the production would be worth and by making some properties uneconomic, resulting in impairments to the recorded value of our reserves and non-cash charges to earnings. For example, in 2016, we reported non-cash impairment charges on our natural gas and oil properties totaling $2,321 million, primarily resulting from decreases in trailing 12-month average first-day-of-the-month natural gas prices throughout 2016, as compared to 2015, and the impairment of certain undeveloped leasehold interests. Further impairments in subsequent periods could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices continue to fall as compared to the average used in prior periods.\n\ufeff\nIn our Midstream Services segment, lower production by us and others can mean reduced volumes being transported in the gathering systems we operate and thus lower revenues.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $4.7 billion of debt outstanding, consisting principally of $3.2 billion in senior notes maturing in various increments from 2017 to 2025 and $1.5 billion in term loans due in 2020. At current commodity price levels, our net cash flow from operations is substantially higher than our interest obligations under this debt, but significant drops in realized prices could affect our ability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due.\n\ufeff\nMoreover, general industry conditions may make it difficult or costly to refinance increments of this debt as it matures. While our indentures do not contain significant covenants restricting our operations and other activities, our 2016 credit agreement contains financial covenants with which we must comply. We refer you to the risk factor \u201cOur current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth.\u201d Our inability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due could have a material and adverse effect on our company. The drop in prices in the past three years has reduced our revenues, profits and cash flow, caused us to record significant asset impairments and led us to reduce both our level of capital investing and our workforce, which has caused us to incur significant expenses relating\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nto employee terminations. Further price decreases could have similar consequences. Similarly, a rise in prices to levels experienced into the middle of 2014 could significantly increase our revenues, profits and cash flow, which could be used to expand capital investments.\n\ufeff\nSignificant capital investment is required to replace our reserves and conduct our business.\n\ufeff\nOur activities require substantial capital investment. We intend to fund our capital investing through net cash flows from operations, plus the uninvested amount of the proceeds from our July 2016 equity offering and West Virginia acreage sale earmarked for capital investment (approximately $200 million remaining as of December 31, 2016). Our ability to generate operating cash flow is subject to many of the risks and uncertainties that exist in our industry, some of which we may not be able to anticipate at this time. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. If we are unable to fund capital investing, we could experience a further reduction in drilling new wells and acquiring new acreage, a loss of properties and a decline in our cash flow from operations and natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids production and reserves.\n\ufeff\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to grow or sustain production.\n\ufeff\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas, oil and NGL reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Recovery of such reserves will require significant capital investment and successful drilling operations. Thus, our future natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our level of capital investments, our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\n\ufeff\nA further downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital and our liquidity.\n\ufeff\nActual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, affect the market value of our senior notes and increase our corporate borrowing costs. Such ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued of the likelihood we will be able to repay our debt. An explanation of the significance of each rating may be obtained from the applicable rating agency. As of February 21, 2017, we were rated Ba3 by Moody\u2019s, BB- by Standard and Poor\u2019s and BB by Fitch Investor Services. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\n\ufeff\nActual downgrades in our credit ratings may also impact our liquidity. Many of our existing commercial contracts contain, and future commercial contracts may contain, provisions permitting the counterparty to require increased security upon the occurrence of a downgrade in our credit rating. Providing additional security, such as posting letters of credit, could reduce our available cash or our liquidity under our revolving credit facility for other purposes. We had $174 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2016. The amount of additional security would depend on the severity of the downgrade from the credit rating agencies, and a downgrade could result in a decrease in our liquidity.\n\ufeff\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging in the face of shifting market conditions, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate.\n\ufeff\nWe necessarily must consider future price and cost environments when deciding how much capital we are likely to have available from net cash flow and how best to allocate it. Our current philosophy is to generally operate within cash flow from operations and to invest capital in projects only if they are projected to generate a PVI of 1.3 or greater, allocating generally to the highest PVI projects. Volatility in prices and potential errors in estimating costs, reserves or timing of production of the reserves could result in uneconomic projects or economic projects generating less than 1.3 PVI.\n\ufeff\nCertain of our undeveloped assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\n\ufeff\nLeases on approximately 159,176 net acres of our Fayetteville Shale acreage (including 158,231 net acres held on federal lands that are currently suspended by the Bureau of Land Management) will expire in the next three years if we do not drill\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsuccessful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases. Approximately 91,379 and 62,520 net acres of our Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia acreage, respectively, will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases. Our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to obtain permits on a timely basis or to compel landowners or lease holders on adjacent properties to cooperate. Further, we may not have sufficient capital to drill all the wells necessary to hold the acreage without increasing our debt levels, or given price projections at the time, drilling may not be estimated to achieve a PVI of at least 1.3. To the extent we do not drill the wells, our rights to acreage can be lost.\n\ufeff\nNatural gas and oil drilling and producing operations and midstream operation can be hazardous and may expose us to liabilities.\n\ufeff\nExploration and production operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failures, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, severe weather, natural disasters, groundwater contamination and other environmental hazards and risks. Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects. If any of these risks occurs, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u00b7\ninjunctions resulting in limitation or suspension of operations.\n\ufeff\nFor our non-operated properties, we are dependent on the operator for operational and regulatory compliance.\n\ufeff\nOur midstream operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in transporting natural gas and ethane and natural gas compression, including:\n\u00b7\ndamages to pipelines, facilities and surrounding properties caused by third parties, severe weather, natural disasters, including hurricanes, and acts of terrorism;\n\u00b7\nmaintenance, repairs, mechanical or structural failures;\n\u00b7\ndamages to, loss of availability of and delays in gaining access to interconnecting third-party pipelines;\n\u00b7\ndisruption or failure of information technology systems and network infrastructure due to various causes, including unauthorized access or attack; and\n\u00b7\nleaks of natural gas or ethane as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities.\n\ufeff\nA material event such as those described above could expose us to liabilities, monetary penalties or interruptions in our business operations. Although we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\n\ufeff\nOur current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2016, we had long-term indebtedness of $4.6 billion, including borrowings of $327 million and $1.2 billion under our term loan credit agreements. The terms of the indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes, our credit facilities, and the master lease agreements relating to our drilling rigs and other equipment, which we collectively refer to as our \u201cfinancing agreements,\u201d impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, which may include, without limitation, one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nincurring additional debt;\n\u00b7\nredeeming stock or redeeming certain debt;\n\u00b7\nmaking certain investments;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ncreating liens on our assets; and\n\u00b7\nselling assets.\nUnder the 2013 revolving credit facility, we must keep our total debt at or below 60% of our total adjusted book capital. This financial covenant with respect to capitalization percentages excludes the effects of any non-cash impacts from any full cost ceiling impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities and our pension and other post-retirement liabilities. Therefore, under the 2013 revolving credit facility, our adjusted capital structure as of December 31, 2016 was 34% debt and 66% equity. Under our 2016 credit agreement, we must maintain certain covenants, including, among others, the following financial covenants:\n\u00b7\nMinimum liquidity of $300 million, subject to increase up to $500 million upon certain conditions;\n\u00b7\nMinimum interest coverage ratio of no less than (i) with respect to any fiscal quarter ended on or before December 31, 2016, 0.75x, (ii) with respect to any fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2017 and on or before December 31, 2017, 1.00x, (iii) with respect to any fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2018 and on or before December 31, 2018, 1.25x and (iv) with respect to any fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2019, 1.50x, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2016; and\n\u00b7\nWith respect to the secured term loan, a minimum collateral coverage ratio of no less than 1.50x of the secured term loan. Currently this collateral consists of most of our interest in E&P properties in the Fayetteville Shale area, the equity in our subsidiaries and cash and marketable securities.\nAlthough we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants, our ability to comply with these covenants are dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs.\n\ufeff\nAlthough the indentures governing the notes contain covenants that apply to us, covenants limiting liens and sale and leaseback covenants contain exceptions and limitations that would allow us, pursuant to the terms of the indenture, to create, grant or incur certain liens or security interests. Moreover, the indentures do not contain any limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries to incur debt, pay dividends, make investments, or limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us. Such activities may, however, be limited by our other financing agreements in certain circumstances.\n\ufeff\nOur level of indebtedness and off-balance sheet obligations, and the covenants contained in our financing agreements, could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital investing and other general business activities;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital investing, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u00b7\ndetracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in our financing agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions.\n\ufeff\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our obligations under the notes or our other financing agreements, and in the case of the lease agreements for drilling rigs, loss of use of our drilling rigs. In particular, a significant or extended decline in natural gas, oil or NGL prices would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our access to capital and the quantities of natural gas, oil and NGLs that we can produce economically. For example, the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, natural gas prices traded at a low of $1.71 in February 2016 and a high of $3.23 in December 2016 based on the settlement price of the monthly contract at expiration. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations. The terms of our financing agreements may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. We cannot assure that any such proposed offering,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrefinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us.\n\ufeff\nWe have made significant investments in pipelines and gathering systems and contracts and in oilfield service businesses, including our drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and sand mine operations, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production. If our exploration and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers.\n\ufeff\nThrough December 31, 2016, we had invested approximately $1.3 billion in our gas gathering system built for the Fayetteville Shale. We may make further substantial investments in the expansion of this system. Our ability to recover the costs of these investments depends on production from the Fayetteville Shale, and reduced production volumes, whether due to lower drilling activity due to lower prices or failure to produce significant quantities of gas in relevant timeframes, can adversely affect our ability to recover these investments.\n\ufeff\nWe also have entered into gathering agreements in other producing areas and multiple long-term firm transportation agreements relating to natural gas volumes from all our producing areas. As of December 31, 2016, our aggregate demand charge commitments under these firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements were approximately $8.4 billion. If our development programs fail to produce sufficient quantities of natural gas and ethane within expected timeframes, we could be forced to pay demand or other charges for transportation on pipelines and gathering systems that we would not be using.\n\ufeff\nWe also have made significant investments to meet certain of our field services\u2019 needs, including establishing our own drilling rig operation, sand mine and pressure pumping capability. Reductions in our operating plans caused by the recent drop in commodity prices has caused us to take much of this equipment out of service and has reduced the need for sand and other services. If our level of operations is reduced for a long period, we may not be able to recover these investments. Further, our presence in these service and supply sectors, including competing with them for qualified personnel and supplies, may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party service and resource providers or our ability to secure these services and resources from other providers.\nOur business depends on access to natural gas, oil and NGL transportation systems and facilities.\nThe marketability of our natural gas, oil and NGL production depends in large part on the operation, availability, proximity, capacity and expansion of transportation systems and facilities owned by third parties. For example, we can provide no assurance that sufficient transportation capacity will exist for expected production from the Appalachian Basin or that we will be able to obtain sufficient transportation capacity on economic terms. During the past year, several planned pipelines intended to service production in the U.S. Northeast have had their in-service dates delayed due to regulatory delays and litigation.\nProducers compete by lowering their sales prices, resulting in the locational differences from NYMEX pricing. Further, a lack of available capacity on transportation systems and facilities or delays in their planned expansions could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. A lack of availability of these systems and facilities for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, we have entered into contracts for firm transportation and any failure to renew those contracts on the same or better commercial terms could increase our costs and our exposure to the risks described above.\n\ufeff\nOur business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWith current technology, water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection control wells.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for earthquakes to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from natural gas and oil activities. New rules and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nregulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We operate injection wells and utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations, subject to regulatory restrictions relating to seismic.\n\ufeff\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur producing properties are concentrated in two regions, the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville Shale, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas.\n\ufeff\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas and the Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. At December 31, 2016, 43% of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in the Appalachian Basin and 57% in the Fayetteville Shale. As a result of this concentration in two primary regions, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, state politics, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas, oil or natural gas liquids.\n\ufeff\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to market natural gas, oil and NGLs, to secure trained personnel and appropriate services, to obtain additional properties and to raise capital.\n\ufeff\nThe cost of our operations is highly dependent on third-party services, and as activity in our industry increases, competition for these services may increase. Similarly, we must have trained, qualified personnel, and as commodity prices rise, competition for this talent also increases. Our ability to acquire and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing natural gas, oil and NGLs and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. Certain of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for personnel, property and services and to attract capital at lower rates. This may become more likely if prices for oil and NGLs recover faster than prices for natural gas, as natural gas comprises a far greater percentage of our overall production than it does for most of the companies with whom we compete for talent.\n\ufeff\nVolatility in the financial markets or in global economic factors could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nOur business may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are reduced energy demand and lower commodity prices, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and reduced access to credit markets. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.\n\ufeff\nOur natural gas and oil exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing environmental protection, the occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of certain plant and animal species. See \u201cOther - Environmental Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us. In order to conduct operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Environmental regulations may restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenues.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including investigatory actions, the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, or\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe issuance of orders or judgments limiting or enjoining future operations. Strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. Moreover, our costs of compliance with existing laws could be substantial and may increase or unforeseen liabilities could be imposed if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. If we are not able to recover the increased costs through insurance or increased revenues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nClimate change legislation or regulations governing the emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduce demand for the natural gas, oil and NGLs we produce.\n\ufeff\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. One of our subsidiaries operates compressor stations, which are facilities that are required to adhere to the PSD or Title V permit requirements. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.\n\ufeff\nThe EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. More recently, in May 2016, the EPA finalized additional regulations to control methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain oil and gas equipment and operations.\n\ufeff\nAlthough Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time.\n\ufeff\nThe adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which is increasing demand.\n\ufeff\nIn December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\ufeff\nOur proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated.\n\ufeff\nAs described in more detail under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Natural Gas and Oil Properties\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, our reserve data represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision of our management, and our reserve estimates are audited each year by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, oil and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as natural gas, oil and NGL prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital investing, taxes and availability of funds. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nestimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.\n\ufeff\nResults of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas, oil and NGLS that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\n\ufeff\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month average natural gas, oil and NGL index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\n\ufeff\nOur commodity price risk management and measurement systems and economic hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.\n\ufeff\nWe currently seek to hedge the price of a significant portion of our estimated production, through swaps, collars, floors and other derivative instruments. The systems we use to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses might not always be followed or might not always be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. Furthermore, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract\u2019s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist.\n\ufeff\nOur use of derivatives, through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under GAAP to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under GAAP, must be recorded in our income. This creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period.\n\ufeff\nThe impact of changes in market prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. These hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market prices for oil, natural gas or NGLs were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss if our production volumes are less than expected.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to dispose of assets on attractive terms, and may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.\n\ufeff\nVarious factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of assets or complete announced dispositions, including the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the assets at prices acceptable to us, particularly in times of reduced and volatile commodity prices. Sellers typically retain certain liabilities for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe implementation of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\n\ufeff\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and entities, including us, which participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized most of its regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, it continues to review and refine its initial rulemakings through additional interpretations and supplemental rulemakings. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business and while most of the regulations have been adopted, any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase the cost of derivative contracts, limit the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital investing.\n\ufeff\nIn December 2016, the CFTC re-proposed new rules that would place federal limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions and finalized a companion rule on aggregation of positions among entities under common ownership or control. If finalized, the position limits rule may have an impact on our ability to hedge our exposure to certain enumerated commodities.\n\ufeff\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. The CFTC may designate additional classes of swaps as subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in the future, but has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. The CFTC and prudential banking regulators also adopted mandatory margin requirements on uncleared swaps between swap dealers and certain other counterparties. The margin requirements are currently effective with respect to certain market participants and will be phased in over time with respect to other market participants, based on the level of an entity\u2019s swaps activity. We expect to qualify for and rely upon an end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks. We also should qualify for an exception from the uncleared swaps margin requirements. However, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements and the uncleared swaps margin requirement to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may adversely affect the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.\n\ufeff\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\n\ufeff\nThe elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies has been proposed in recent years by members of the U.S. Congress and by former President Obama in his fiscal year 2017 budget proposal. These changes have included, among other proposals:\n\u00b7\nrepeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties;\n\u00b7\nelimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs;\n\u00b7\nelimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities; and\n\u00b7\nextension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\n\ufeff\nIt is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted. The passage of these or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws to eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe may experience adverse or unforeseen tax consequences due to further developments affecting our deferred tax assets that could significantly affect our results.\n\ufeff\nDeferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, represent future savings of taxes that would otherwise be paid in cash. At December 31, 2016, the Company had substantial amounts of net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. These loss carryforwards will eventually expire if not utilized. In addition, limitations may exist upon use of these carryforwards in the event that a change in control of the Company occurs. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a valuation allowance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nagainst its entire deferred tax asset, including the portion related to the remaining net operating loss carryforwards. This allowance was recorded primarily as a result of cumulative book losses experienced over the three-year period ending December 31, 2016. If we experience additional book losses, we may be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\n\ufeff\nOur existing deferred tax asset valuation allowance may also be reversed if significant events occur or market conditions change materially, and our current or future earnings are, or are projected to be, significantly higher than we currently estimate. This reversal may result in a significant one-time favorable impact positively affecting our consolidated results of operations for the period of reversal and for the full fiscal year results.\n\ufeff\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\n\ufeff\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, communicate with employees and business associates, perform compliance reporting and in many other activities related to our business. Our business associates, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions are also dependent on digital technology.\n\ufeff\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\n\ufeff\nA cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including:\n\u00b7\nunauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for natural gas and oil resources;\n\u00b7\nunauthorized access to personal identifying information of royalty owners, employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect that information;\n\u00b7\ndata corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u00b7\na cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our major development projects; and\n\u00b7\na cyber-attack on a third party gathering, pipeline or rail service provider could delay or prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues.\n\ufeff\nThese events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\ufeff\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\n\ufeff\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\n\ufeff\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, seismicity, oil spills and explosions of natural gas transmission lines, may lead to regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nCommon stockholders will be diluted if additional shares are issued.\n\ufeff\nIn July 2016, we consummated an underwritten offering of 98.9 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, with net proceeds of the offering totaling approximately $1,247 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The proceeds from the offering were used to repay $375 million of the $750 million term loan entered into in November 2015 and to settle certain tender offers by purchasing an aggregate principal amount of approximately $700 million of our outstanding senior notes due in the first quarter of 2018. The remaining net proceeds of the offering have been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of wells already drilled or the funding of other capital projects.\n\ufeff\nIn January 2015, we issued 30.0 million shares of common stock and 34.5 million depositary shares representing the 1/20th interest in our 6.25% Series B Mandatory Preferred Stock, which will convert into a minimum of approximately 64 million or a maximum of 75 million shares of common stock by January 2018, to refinance a portion of the debt we incurred to purchase acreage in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania. Dividends on our 6.25% Series B Mandatory Preferred Stock are payable quarterly until they convert to common stock in January 2018, which dividends we may pay in cash or shares of our common stock. During 2016, we issued approximately 6.9 million shares of our common stock to satisfy our dividend obligations, and we may continue to issue common stock in satisfaction of our dividend obligation in 2017. We also issue restricted stock, options and performance share units to our employees and directors as part of their compensation. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock, additional notes or other securities or debt convertible into common stock, to extend maturities or fund capital expenditures. If we issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our current outstanding stockholders.\n\ufeff\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n\ufeff\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, protective provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws or the implementation by our board of directors of a stockholder rights plan that could deter a takeover.", "PERMNO": 63765, "SIC": 4923, "TIC": "SWN"}
