{"cik": "863436", "company": "BENCHMARK ELECTRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully when reviewing the Company\u2019s business, the forward-looking statements contained in this Report, and the other statements the Company or its representatives make from time to time. Any of the following factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition and the actual results of the matters addressed by the forward-looking statements.\nAdverse market conditions in the electronics industry could reduce our future sales and earnings per share.\nUncertainty over the erosion of global consumer confidence amidst concerns about declining asset values, inflation, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations has slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in many countries, including in the United States, Europe and certain countries in Asia over the past several years. Even though we have seen signs of an overall economic recovery, such recovery may be weak and/or short-lived and recessionary conditions may return. If any of these potential negative economic conditions occur, they may result in lower spending by businesses in the future, which may affect demand for our customers\u2019 products and adversely affect our sales. Consequently, our past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of our future operating results, earnings and cash flows.\nIn addition to our customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, a number of other negative effects on our business could materialize, including the insolvency of key suppliers, which could result in production delays, shorter payment terms from suppliers due to reduced availability of credit default insurance in the market, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, increase our need for cash, and decrease our net revenue and profitability.\nWe are exposed to general economic conditions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is cyclical and has experienced economic and industry downturns. If economic conditions or demand for our customers\u2019 products deteriorate, we may experience a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us, we establish reserves in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk. There can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional receivable and inventory reserves may be required and restructuring charges may be incurred.\nShortages or price increases of components specified by our customers would delay shipments and adversely affect our profitability.\nSubstantially all of our sales are derived from manufacturing services in which we purchase components specified\nby our customers. In the past, supply shortages have substantially curtailed production of all assemblies using a particular component and industry-wide shortages of electronic components, particularly of memory and logic devices, have occurred. For example, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan disrupted the global supply chain for certain components manufactured in Japan that were incorporated in the products we manufactured, and the 2011 Thailand flood had a similar impact. Any such component shortages may result in delayed shipments, which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins. Also, because of the continued increase in demand for surface mount components, we anticipate component shortages and longer lead times for certain components to occur from time to time. Also, we may bear the risk of component price increases that occur between periodic re-pricings of product during the term of a customer contract. Accordingly, certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins.\nWe are dependent on the success of our customers. When our customers experience a downturn in their business, we may be similarly affected.\nWe are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers. Our customers are OEMs of:\n\u00b7 industrial control equipment;\n\u00b7 telecommunication equipment;\n\u00b7 computers and related products for business enterprises;\n\u00b7 medical devices; and\n\u00b7 testing and instrumentation products.\nThese industries are subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and consequent product obsolescence. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected.\nThe loss of a major customer would adversely affect us.\nHistorically, a substantial percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers. The loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us. Sales to our ten largest customers represented 50%, 53% and 56% of our sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In 2014, sales to Arris Group, Inc. and International Business Machines Corporation each represented 11% of our sales. Our future sales are dependent on the success of our customers, some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence. Developments adverse to our major customers or their products, or the failure of a major customer to pay for components or services, could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe expect to continue to depend on the sales to our largest customers and any material delay, cancellation or reduction of orders from these customers or other significant customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nMost of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity.\nThe volume and timing of sales to our customers vary due to:\n\u00b7 changes in demand for our customers\u2019 products;\n\u00b7 our customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory;\n\u00b7 design changes;\n\u00b7 changes in our customers\u2019 manufacturing strategies; and\n\u00b7 acquisitions of, or consolidations among, customers.\nDue in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance. Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity. In the past, we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have, in the past, failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 business needs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. On other occasions, our customers have required rapid increases in production, which have placed an excessive burden on our resources. Such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past, and may again in the future. A business downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating income. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\nOur customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategies.\nEMS providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and we continue to experience reduced lead-times in customer orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy for a number of reasons. The degree of success or failure of our customers\u2019 products in the market affects our business. Cancellations, reductions, delays or changes in the sourcing strategy by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating income.\nIn addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs, capital expenditures and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. The short-term nature of our customers\u2019 commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products impede our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers.\nOn occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\nWe may encounter significant delays or defaults in payments owed to us by customers for products we have manufactured or components that are unique to particular customers.\nWe structure our agreements with customers to mitigate our risks related to obsolete or unsold inventory. However, enforcement of these contracts may result in material expense and delay in payment for inventory. If any of our significant customers become unable or unwilling to purchase such inventory, our business may be materially harmed. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.\nOur international operations may be subject to certain risks.\nDuring 2014, 2013 and 2012, 53%, 51% and 50%, respectively, of our sales were from our international operations. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7 coordinating communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones;\n\u00b7 less flexible employee relationships, which complicate meeting demand fluctuations and can be difficult and expensive to terminate;\n\u00b7 political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war), which could impact our ability to ship and/or receive product;\n\u00b7 changes in government policies, regulatory requirements and laws, which could impact our business;\n\u00b7 longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 export duties, import controls and trade barriers (including quotas);\n\u00b7 governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u00b7 risk of governmental expropriation of our property;\n\u00b7 burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices, including various and changing minimum wage regulations;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could affect component costs, local payroll, utility and other expenses; and\n\u00b7 inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations to reduce our U.S. income taxes.\nIn addition, several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies, which may be subject to greater currency volatility, negative growth, high inflation, limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks. Additionally, some of our operations are in developing countries. Certain events, including natural disasters, can impact the infrastructure of a developing country more severely than they would impact the infrastructure of a developed country. A developing country can also take longer to recover from such events, which could lead to delays in our ability to resume full operations. These factors may harm our results of operations, and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective. In our experience, entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start-up expenses for market development, hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated. As a result, initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable.\nAdditionally, certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as the U.S. government, restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the U.S or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our operations in the United States, we may incur significant penalties and/or taxes to repatriate these funds.\nAnother significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the\nFCPA, other U.S. laws and regulations, or similar laws of host countries and related anti-bribery conventions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the FCPA and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents, or those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry; if we are not able to compete effectively in the EMS industry, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe compete against many providers of electronics manufacturing services. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and more geographically diversified international operations than we do. Our competitors include large independent manufacturers such as Celestica Inc., Flextronics International Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Jabil Circuit, Inc., Plexus Corp and Sanmina Corporation. In addition, we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling, or may begin to sell, electronics manufacturing services.\nWe also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and future customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing to EMS providers. In addition, in recent years, ODMs that provide design and manufacturing services to OEMs, have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to OEMs in several markets, such as notebook and desktop computers, personal computer motherboards, and consumer electronic products. Competition from ODMs may increase if our business in these markets grows or if ODMs expand further into or beyond these markets.\nDuring periods of recession in the electronics industry, our competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronics OEMs, who may become more price sensitive. We may also be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures, particularly those with more offshore facilities located where labor and other costs are lower.\nWe experience intense competition, which can intensify further as more companies enter the markets in which we operate, as existing competitors expand capacity and as the industry consolidates. The availability of excess manufacturing capacity at many of our competitors creates intense pricing and competitive pressure on the EMS industry as a whole and Benchmark in particular. To compete effectively, we must continue to provide technologically advanced manufacturing services, maintain strict quality standards, respond flexibly and rapidly to customers\u2019 design and schedule changes and deliver products globally on a reliable basis at competitive prices. Our inability to do so could have an adverse effect on us.\nThe integration of acquired operations may pose difficulties for us.\nOur capabilities have continued to grow through acquisitions, and we may pursue additional acquisitions over time. These acquisitions involve risks, including:\n\u00b7 integration and management of the operations;\n\u00b7 retention of key personnel;\n\u00b7 integration of purchasing operations and information systems;\n\u00b7 retention of the customer base of acquired businesses;\n\u00b7 management of an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business;\n\u00b7 the possibility that past transactions or practices may lead to future commercial or regulatory risks; and\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other ongoing business concerns.\nOur profitability will suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate an acquisition, or if we do not achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses associated with these acquisitions.\nWe may experience fluctuations in quarterly results.\nOur quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7 the volume of customer orders relative to our capacity;\n\u00b7 customer introduction and market acceptance of new products;\n\u00b7 changes in demand for customer products;\n\u00b7 seasonality in demand for customer products;\n\u00b7 pricing and other competitive pressures;\n\u00b7 the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders;\n\u00b7 our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 changes in cost and availability of labor and components;\n\u00b7 changes in our product mix;\n\u00b7 changes in political and economic conditions; and\n\u00b7 local factors and events that may affect our production volume, such as local holidays or natural disasters.\nAdditionally, as is the case with many high technology companies, a significant portion of our shipments typically occur in the last few weeks of a given quarter. Accordingly, sales shifts from quarter to quarter may not be readily apparent until the end of a given quarter, and may have a significant effect on reported results.\nStart-up costs and inefficiencies related to new or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results and such costs may not be recoverable if the new programs or transferred programs are cancelled.\nStart-up costs, the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with the establishment of new programs and new customer relationships, and the need to estimate required resources in advance can adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life cycle of new products and new programs or program transfers and in the opening of new facilities. These factors also affect our ability to efficiently use labor and equipment. We are currently managing a number of new programs. If any of these new programs or new customer relationships were terminated, our operating results could be harmed, particularly in the short term. We may not be able to recoup these start-up costs or replace anticipated new program revenues.\nWe may be affected by consolidation in the electronics industry, which could create increased pricing and competitive pressures on our business.\nConsolidation in the electronics industry could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek to close plants or take other steps to increase efficiencies and realize synergies of mergers. The availability of excess manufacturing capacity could create increased pricing and competitive pressures for the EMS industry as a whole and our business in particular. In addition, consolidation could also result in an increasing number of very large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics industry. The growth of these large companies, with significant purchasing and marketing power, could also result in increased pricing and competitive pressures for us. Accordingly, industry consolidation could harm our business. We may need to increase our efficiencies to compete and may incur additional restructuring charges.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased taxes.\nWe base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes.\nSeveral countries where we operate allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business. We have obtained holidays or other incentives where available. Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted, or if they are not renewed upon expiration, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased. In addition, further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase. Given the scope of our international operations and our international tax arrangements, proposed changes to the manner in which U.S. based multinational companies are taxed in the U.S. could have a material impact on our financial results and competitiveness.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk; our goodwill may become further impaired.\nWe have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill, in connection with business acquisitions. We are required to assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. A significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization could result in material charges in future periods that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position. As of December 31, 2014, we had $46.0 million in goodwill and $19.6 million of identifiable intangible assets. See Note 1(i) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the SEC are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nAny litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nIn the past, we have been notified of claims relating to various matters including intellectual property rights, contractual matters, labor issues or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of any such claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money and resources, even where the claim is without merit. Accordingly, the resolution of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our key personnel.\nWe depend significantly on our executive officers and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any one of these executive officers or other key personnel could have an adverse effect on us.\nIf we are unable to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe market for our manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development. We are continually evaluating the advantages and feasibility of new manufacturing processes. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and provide manufacturing services which meet our customers\u2019 changing needs. This requires that we maintain technological leadership and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis. Our failure to maintain our technological and manufacturing process expertise could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur common shares have experienced significant price volatility, which may continue in the future. The price of our shares could fluctuate widely in response to a range of factors, including our financial results and changing conditions in the economy generally or in our industry in particular. In addition, stock markets generally experience significant price and volume volatility from time to time which may affect the market price of our shares for reasons unrelated to our performance.\nProvisions in our governing documents and state law may make it harder for others to obtain control of our company.\nCertain provisions of our governing documents and the Texas Business Organizations Code may delay, inhibit or prevent someone from gaining control of our company through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or some other method, even if shareholders might consider such a development beneficial. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 a provision in our certificate of formation granting the Board of Directors authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the relative rights and preferences of such preferred stock;\n\u00b7 provisions in our bylaws restricting shareholders from acting by less than unanimous written consent and requiring advance notification of shareholder nominations and proposals;\n\u00b7 a provision in our bylaws restricting anyone, other than the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Board of Directors or the holders of at least 10% of all outstanding shares entitled to vote, from calling a special meeting of the shareholders;\n\u00b7 a statutory restriction on the ability of shareholders to take action by less than unanimous written consent; and\n\u00b7 a statutory restriction on business combinations with some types of interested shareholders.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in or derived from our manufacturing processes. If we or companies we acquire have failed or fail in the future to comply with such laws and regulations, then we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended. Such laws and regulations could also restrict our ability to modify or expand our facilities, could require us to acquire costly equipment, or could impose other significant expenditures. In addition, our operations may give rise to claims of property contamination or human exposure to hazardous chemicals or conditions.\nOur worldwide operations are subject to local laws and regulations. Over the last several years, we have become subject to the RoHS directive and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. These directives restrict the distribution of products containing certain substances, including lead, within applicable geographies and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances.\nThese directives affect the worldwide electronics and electronics components industries as a whole. If we or our customers fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended.\nIn addition, as climate change issues become more prevalent, the U.S. and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues. This increasing governmental focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our customers. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs or obligations in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by geopolitical events.\nAs a global business, we operate and have customers located in many countries. Geopolitical events such as terrorist acts may affect the overall economic environment and negatively impact the demand for our customers\u2019 products or our ability to ship or receive products. As a result, customer orders may be lower and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by natural disasters.\nSome of our facilities, including our corporate headquarters, are located in areas that may be impacted by hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters. Our insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate, or may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. For example, we have been unable to renew or otherwise obtain adequate cost-effective flood insurance to cover assets at our facilities in Thailand as a result of the flooding that occurred in 2011. We continue to monitor the insurance market in Thailand. In the event we were to experience a significant uninsured loss in Thailand or elsewhere, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack. If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical, or we may be unable, to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays. Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus negatively affect our relationships and financial results.\nWe may be exposed to interest rate fluctuations.\nWe will have exposure to interest rate risk under our variable rate revolving credit facilities to the extent we incur indebtedness under such facilities. These facilities\u2019 interest rates are based on the spread over the bank\u2019s prime rate or LIBOR. We are also exposed to interest rate risk on our invested cash balances.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, changes in securities laws and regulations have increased, and are likely to continue to increase, our operating costs.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions that are completed before a change is announced. Changes to those rules or the questioning of how we interpret or implement those rules may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. For example, although not yet currently required, we could be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which is different from U.S. GAAP.\nIn addition, in connection with our Section 404 certification process, we may identify from time to time deficiencies in our internal controls. Any material weakness or deficiency in our internal controls over financial reporting could materially and negatively impact our reported financial results and the market price of our stock. Additionally, adverse publicity related to the disclosure of a material weakness or deficiency in internal controls over financial reporting could have a negative impact on our reputation, business and stock price.\nFinally, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action, agency rulemaking and stockholder advisory group policies. As a result, the number of rules and\nregulations applicable to us may increase, which would also increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time management must devote to compliance activities. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries that are believed to be benefitting armed groups. As a result, the SEC adopted new due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements for companies which manufacture products that include components containing such minerals, regardless of whether the minerals are mined in the DRC or adjoining countries. These requirements may decrease the acceptable sources of supply of such minerals, increase their cost and disrupt our supply chain if we need to obtain components from different suppliers. Since we manufacture products containing such minerals for our customers, we are required to comply with these rules. As the method of complying with the new regulation is unclear, the compliance process may become time-consuming and costly. Failure to comply with this new regulation could result in additional costs (including but not limited to, fines or penalties) as well as affect our reputation. Increasing regulatory burdens could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and executive officers in light of an increase in actual or perceived workload and liability for serving in such positions.\nEnergy price increases may negatively impact our results of operations.\nCertain of the components that we use in our manufacturing activities are petroleum-based. In addition, we, along with our suppliers and customers, rely on various energy sources (including oil) in our transportation activities. While significant uncertainty currently exists about the future levels of energy prices, a significant increase is possible. Increased energy prices could cause an increase to our raw material costs and transportation costs. In addition, increased transportation costs of certain of our suppliers and customers could be passed along to us. We may not be able to increase our product prices enough to offset these increased costs. In addition, any increase in our product prices may reduce our future customer orders and profitability.\nIntroducing programs requiring implementation of new competencies, including new process technology within our mechanical operations, could affect our operations and financial results.\nThe introduction of programs requiring implementation of new competencies, including new process technology within our mechanical operations, presents challenges in addition to opportunities. Deployment of such programs may require us to invest significant resources and capital in facilities, equipment and/or personnel. We may not meet our customers\u2019 expectations or otherwise execute properly or in a cost-efficient manner, which could damage our customer relationships and result in remedial costs or the loss of our invested capital and anticipated revenues and profits. In addition, there are risks of market acceptance and product performance that could result in less demand than anticipated and our having excess capacity. The failure to ensure that our agreed terms appropriately reflect the anticipated costs, risks, and rewards of such an opportunity could adversely affect our profitability. If we do not meet one or more of these challenges, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf our manufacturing processes and services do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects, demand for our services may decline and we may be subject to liability claims.\nWe manufacture and design products to our customers\u2019 specifications, and, in some cases, our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. For example, medical devices that we manufacture or design, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them, are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and non-U.S. counterparts of this agency. Similarly, items we manufacture for customers in the defense and aerospace industries, as well as the processes we use to produce them, are regulated by the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Authority, which have increased their focus and penalties related to counterfeit materials. In addition, our customers\u2019 products and the manufacturing processes or documentation that we use to produce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or\nnot be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Defects in the products we manufacture or design, whether caused by a design, manufacturing or component failure or error, or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders. If these defects or deficiencies are significant, our business reputation may also be damaged. The failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility. In addition, these defects may result in liability claims against us or expose us to liability to pay for the recall of a product. The magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical and aerospace and defense manufacturing services, as defects in medical devices and aerospace and defense systems could seriously harm or kill users of these products and others. Even if our customers are responsible for the defects, they may not, or may not have resources to, assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects, which could expose us to additional liability claims.\nCustomer relationships with emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies.\nCustomer relationships with emerging companies present special risks because such companies do not have an extensive product history. As a result, there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products, making it harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers. In addition, due to the current economic environment, additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we planned or we previously experienced. This tightening of financing for start-up customers, together with many start-up customers\u2019 lack of prior operations and unproven product markets increase our credit risk, especially in trade accounts receivable and inventories. Although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for all customers, including start-up customers, based on the information available, these allowances may not be adequate. This risk may exist for any new emerging company customers in the future.\nWe are subject to breach of our security systems.\nWe have implemented security systems to secure our physical facilities and protect our confidential information, as well as that of our customers and suppliers. Information technology plays an ever-increasing role in today\u2019s business; we maintain some of our information systems, but also rely on third parties for a portion of our needs. The recent successes of sophisticated hackers have been well publicized and, despite our efforts, we are subject to breach of security systems, which could result in unauthorized access to our facilities and the information we are trying to protect. If unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems, or if information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, any theft or misuse of such information could result, among other things, in unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations of contractual breach, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of the information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow. In addition, we rely on our information systems to run our business; despite our efforts to create appropriate redundancies and ensure continuous information flow, even simple failures in these systems resulting from natural disasters or facility damage can lead to supply or production interruptions that result in lost profits, contractual penalties and reputational damage.\nThe risk of uninsured losses will be borne by Benchmark.\nAs a result of the massive flooding in the Fall of 2011, we have been unable to renew or otherwise obtain cost-effective flood insurance to adequately cover assets at our facilities in Thailand. We continue to monitor the insurance market in Thailand. We maintain insurance on all our properties and operations-including our assets in Thailand-for risks and in amounts customary in the industry. While such insurance includes general liability, property & casualty, and directors & officers liability coverage, not all losses are insured, and we retain certain risks of loss through deductibles, limits and self-retentions. In the event we were to experience a significant uninsured loss in Thailand or elsewhere, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.", "PERMNO": 76224, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "BHE"}
