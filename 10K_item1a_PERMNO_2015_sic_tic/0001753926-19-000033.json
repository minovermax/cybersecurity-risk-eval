{"cik": "1080056", "company": "THESTREET, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Report, before deciding whether to invest in our Common Stock. Our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our Common Stock could decline as a result of any of these risks, and you could lose part or all of your investment in our Common Stock. When deciding whether to invest in our Common Stock, you should also refer to the other information in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Report entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Please also refer to the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing in this Annual Report.\nThe sale of our B2B Business may adversely affect our B2C Business.\nThe sale of our B2B business may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, our business or our relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees. Third parties may be unwilling to enter into material agreements with respect to the B2C business. New or existing customers, suppliers and business partners may prefer to enter into agreements with our competitors who have not sold a portion of its business because customers, suppliers and business partners may perceive that such new relationships are likely to be more stable. Additionally, employees working in the B2C business may become concerned about the future of the B2C business and lose focus or seek other employment.\nWe are no longer engaged in the B2B business and our future results of operations will be dependent solely on the B2C business and differ materially from our previous results.\nThe B2B business generated approximately 48% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Accordingly, our future financial results will differ materially from our previous results as they will be dependent solely on our B2C business. Any downturn in our B2C business, or if we fail to bring overhead costs in line with our reduced operations following the sale of our B2B business, could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe continue to incur the expenses of complying with public company reporting requirements notwithstanding the decrease in the size of our operations following the sale of our B2B business.\nWe continue to be required to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The expense of complying with these requirements will represent a greater percentage of our revenues and overall operating expenses than they did prior to the sale of our B2B business because of our reduced operations.\nWe are subject to two-year non-solicitation and non-competition covenants under the Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement by and between the Company and Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, which may limit our ability to operate the B2C business in certain respects or sell the B2C business to certain third parties.\nWe are subject to two-year non-solicitation and non-competition covenants made in the Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement by and between the Company and Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC. During such two-year period, we will be restricted from (i) providing coverage to institutional investors, lawyers and other customers on changes in corporate control, including mergers and acquisitions, private equity, corporate activism and restructuring, and related services and including products and services as available as at the date of the Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement through the service currently known as \u201cThe Deal\u201d and (ii) providing relationship capital management services and director, officer and deal-maker data and related services and including products and services as available at the date of the Non-Solicitation and Non-Competition Agreement through the service currently known as \u201cBoardEx.\u201d In addition, subject to certain exceptions, we will be restricted from acquiring any entity, person or business engaged in any such B2B business activities and from directly or indirectly soliciting or hiring any continuing employee of the B2B business who is employed by Euromoney or The Deal, L.L.C. or any of their respective subsidiaries.\nWhile we do not currently believe these limitations negatively affect our B2C business, certain third-party acquirers of the B2C business would be subject to these limitations for a limited period of time, which may limit our opportunities with respect to a future sale transaction of the B2C business or TheStreet as a whole during such time that may otherwise be favorable to our stockholders.\nStrategic divestitures and contingent liabilities from businesses that we sell could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have in the past sold and may continue to sell businesses, including all or a portion of the B2C business, that we consider no longer part of our strategic vision, such as our sale in June 2018 of the RateWatch business and our sale in February 2019 of our B2B business. The sale of any such business could result in a financial loss or write-down of goodwill, or both, which could have a material adverse effect on our results for the financial reporting period during which such sale occurs. In addition, in connection with such divestitures, we have retained, and may in the future retain responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to certain divestitures such as lawsuits, tax liabilities and intellectual property matters.\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate, and our future revenue is difficult to forecast.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, including:\n\u25cf the level of interest and investment in individual stocks versus index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) by both individual and institutional investors, which can impact our ability to sell premium subscription products and to sell advertising;\n\u25cf the overall willingness of potential and existing customers to pay for content distributed over the Internet, where a large quantity of content is available for free;\n\u25cf demand and pricing for online advertising on TheStreet.com, which is affected by advertising budget cycles of our customers, general economic conditions, demand for advertising on the Internet generally, the supply of advertising inventory in the market and actions by our competitors;\n\u25cf the value to potential and existing customers of the investing ideas we offer in our subscription services and the performance of those ideas relative to appropriate benchmarks;\n\u25cf new products or services introduced by our competitors;\n\u25cf cost of content production, specifically video, traffic acquisition costs, and/or other costs;\n\u25cf costs or lost revenue associated with system downtime affecting the Internet generally or our Websites in particular;\n\u25cf general economic and financial market conditions; and\n\u25cf our ability to attract and retain editorial and managerial talent.\nWe reported net income in 2017 for the first time in almost a decade, however, we had a net loss in 2018, and have incurred net losses for most years of our history. Despite reporting net income in 2017, there are no assurances we will be able to generate net income in future periods and we cannot assure you that we will reach profitability in the future or at any specific time in the future or that, if and when we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue and meet our financial targets and the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price of our Common Stock is likely to continue to decline.\nKey content contributors, particularly James J. Cramer, are important to our premium subscription offerings.\nSome of our products, particularly our editorial subscription products, reflect the talents, efforts, personalities, investing skills and portfolio returns, and reputations of their respective writers. As a result, the services of these key content contributors, including our co-founder and chief markets commentator, James J. Cramer, form an essential element of our subscription revenue. In addition to his content contributions, we benefit from Mr. Cramer\u2019s popularity and visibility, which have provided public awareness of our services and introduced our content to new audiences. For example, Mr. Cramer hosts CNBC\u2019s finance television show, Mad Money. If, however, Mr. Cramer no longer appeared on the show or the program was cancelled for any reason, it could negatively impact his public profile and visibility, and in turn, our subscription products. Further, the continued value of Mr. Cramer\u2019s contributions could be materially adversely affected if Mr. Cramer were to otherwise lose popularity with the public. While we believe we greatly benefit from Mr. Cramer\u2019s contributions and his media exposure for other companies, we can give no assurance that our relationship with Mr. Cramer will lead to higher revenues from our subscription products or improve our organic growth.\nOn November 8, 2017, the company and Mr. Cramer entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with a new four-year term, effective January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2021. The employment agreement may be terminated by Mr. Cramer for specified events provided under the employment agreement, and if Mr. Cramer does not complete the term of his employment agreement, our business could be harmed by the loss of his services.\nIn addition to Mr. Cramer, we seek to compensate and provide incentives for key content contributors through competitive salaries, stock ownership and bonus plans and/or royalty arrangements, and we have entered into employment or contributor agreements with certain of them. If we are unable to retain key content contributors, or, should we lose the services of one or more of our key content contributors to death, disability, loss of reputation or other reason, or should their popularity diminish or their investing returns and investing ideas fail to meet or exceed benchmarks and investor expectations, we may fail to attract new content contributors acceptable to readers of our collection of Websites and editorial subscription products. Thus, the loss of services of one or more of our key content contributors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to successfully attract and retain subscribers to our premium subscription services may be affected by the perceived quality of our content and products, and other factors.\nSubscription revenue makes up a significant portion of our overall revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, subscription revenue accounted for approximately 81% of our total revenue.\nB2C subscription revenue accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenue and 71% of our total B2C revenue. Our ability to successfully attract and retain subscribers to our B2C subscription products depends on the quality of the content, including the performance of any investment ideas published. To the extent the returns on such portfolios fail to meet or exceed the expectations of our subscribers or the performance of relevant benchmarks, our ability to attract new subscribers or retain existing subscribers to such services will be adversely affected. Additionally, factors such as the expiration of temporary product promotions, changes in our renewal policies or practices for subscribers, or changes in the degree of credit card failures could have a material impact on customer retention.\nWe may have difficulty maintaining or increasing our advertising revenue, a significant portion of which is concentrated among our top advertisers and subject to industry and other factors.\nAlthough our reliance on advertising has decreased as an overall component of our revenues, it remains important to our growth. Our ability to maintain or increase our advertising revenue may be adversely affected by a variety of factors. Such factors include general market conditions, seasonal fluctuations in financial news consumption and overall online usage, our ability to maintain or increase our unique visitors, page view inventory and user engagement, our ability to attract audiences possessing demographic characteristics most desired by our advertisers, and our ability to retain existing advertisers and win new advertisers in a number of advertising categories from other Websites, television, newspapers, magazines, newsletters or other new media.\nAs a general matter, the continued fragmentation of digital media has intensified competition for advertising revenues. Advertising revenue could decline if the relationships we have with high-traffic Websites are adversely affected. In addition, our advertising revenue may decline as a result of demand for our products and services, pricing pressures on Internet advertising rates due to industry developments, changes in consumer interest in the financial media and other factors in and outside of our control, including in particular as a result of any significant or prolonged downturn in, or periods of extreme volatility of, the financial markets. Also, our advertising revenue would be adversely affected if advertisers sought to use third-party networks to attempt to reach our audience while they visit third-party sites instead of purchasing advertising from us to reach our audience on our own sites. Further, any advertising revenue that is performance-based may be adversely impacted by the foregoing and other factors. If our advertising revenue significantly decreases, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition to the headwinds facing digital media advertising, technologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that can block the display of our ads, particularly advertising displayed on personal computers. We generate a portion of our revenue from advertising, including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers. These technologies may have had an adverse effect on our financial results and, if such technologies continue to proliferate, in particular with respect to mobile platforms, our ability to generate advertising revenue may be harmed.\nAdvertising revenue, of which our top five advertisers accounted for approximately 60%, generated 12% of our total revenue in 2018. Although we have advertisers from outside the financial services industry, such as travel, automotive and technology, a large proportion of our top advertisers are concentrated in financial services, particularly in the online brokerage business. Recent consolidation of financial institutions and other factors could cause us to lose a number of our top advertisers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As is typical in the advertising industry, generally, our advertising contracts have short notice cancellation provisions.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for delivery of content and have resulted in a wide variety of consumer demands and expectations, which are also rapidly evolving. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nThe increasing number of digital media options available on the Internet, through social networking tools and through mobile and other devices distributing content is expanding consumer choice significantly. Faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume digital content.\nIn addition, the expenditures necessary to implement these new technologies could be substantial and other companies employing such technologies before we are able to do so could aggressively compete with our business.\nMany individuals are increasingly using mobile devices rather than personal computers to access news and other online services. If we are unable to effectively provide our content and subscription products to users of these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access news and other online services through mobile devices continues to increase at a rapid rate. As the use of mobile accelerates as the \u201cgo-to\u201d method of consuming digital content, our ability to monetize mobile content, for which CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) are lower but on the rise, is increasingly important. We may not be able to generate revenue from advertising or content delivered to mobile devices as effectively as we have for advertising or content delivered to personal computers. As our members increasingly use mobile devices to access our digital products if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our content on mobile devices, if these strategies are not as successful as our offerings for personal computers, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected. Additionally, as new devices, such as wearables, and innovative platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such new services and products.\nWe face significant competition. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have larger customer bases, more established brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, some of our competitors and many potential competitors are better capitalized than we are and able to obtain capital more easily, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nMany of our competitors have larger customer bases, more established name recognition, a greater market share and greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with our current or future competitors or that this competition will not significantly harm our business.\nOur services face intense competition from other providers of business, personal finance, investing and ratings content, including:\n\u25cf online content providers focused on business, personal finance or investing content, such as The Wall Street Journal Digital Network, CNN Business, Forbes.com, Reuters.com, Bloomberg.com, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider and CNBC.com, as well as portals such as Yahoo! Finance, AOL Daily Finance and MSN; and\n\u25cf publishers and distributors of traditional media with a focus on business, finance or investing, such as The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, personal finance talk radio programs and business television networks such as Bloomberg, CNBC and the Fox Business Channel as well as investment newsletter publishers, such as The Motley Fool, Stansberry & Associates Investment Research and InvestorPlace Media.\nAdditionally, advances in technology have reduced the cost of production and online distribution of print, audio and video content, which has resulted in the proliferation of providers of free content. We compete with these other publications and services for customers, including subscribers, readers and viewers of our video content, for advertising revenue, and for employees and contributors to our services. Our ability to compete successfully depends on many factors, including the quality, originality, timeliness, insightfulness and trustworthiness of our content and that of our competitors, the popularity and performance of our contributors, the success of our recommendations and research, our ability to introduce products and services that keep pace with new investing trends, our ability to adopt and deploy new technologies for running our business, the ease of use of services developed either by us or our competitors and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. In addition, media technologies and platforms are rapidly evolving and the rate of consumption of media on various platforms may shift rapidly. If we fail to offer our content through the platforms in which our audience desires to consume it, or if we do not have offerings on such platforms that are as compelling as those of our competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In addition, the economics of distributing content through new platforms may be materially different from the economics of distributing content through our current platforms and any such difference may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on attracting and retaining capable management and operating personnel.\nOur ability to execute our business plan and improve our chances for success in 2019 and beyond depend in large part upon the continued service of our executive officers as well as other key employees. In addition, our ability to compete in the marketplace depends upon our ability to recruit and retain other key employees, including executives to operate our business, technology personnel to run our publishing, commerce, communications, video and other systems, direct marketers to sell subscriptions to our premium services and salespersons to sell our advertising inventory and subscriptions.\nSeveral, but not all, of our key employees are bound by agreements containing non-competition provisions. There can be no assurances that these arrangements with key employees will provide adequate protections to us or will not result in further management changes that would have material adverse impact on us. In addition, we may incur increased costs to continue to compensate our key executives, as well as other employees, through competitive salaries, stock ownership and bonus plans. Nevertheless, we can make no assurances that these programs will allow us to retain our management or key employees or hire new employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees, or our inability to attract experienced and qualified replacements, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to execute its turnaround, it may not be able to implement its growth strategy successfully.\nThe Company continues to evolve into a diverse financial news, data and information company and the success of this depends on the effective execution of our turnaround strategy. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has been undertaking a strategic review of the Company\u2019s businesses in order to enhance shareholder value and, in doing so, it may decide to prioritize investments in certain lines of our business as compared to others. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s growth strategy will be successfully implemented. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nAcquisitions pose inherent financial and other risks and challenges.\nAs a part of our strategic plan, we have acquired businesses and may look to acquire businesses in the future. These acquisitions can involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability. Such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty in integrating personnel, operations, and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; and acquisition-related earnings charges. The benefits of an acquisition or an investment may take considerable time to develop and certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets. If our acquisitions are not successful, we may record impairment charges. Our ability to continue to make acquisitions will depend upon our success at identifying suitable targets, which requires substantial judgment in assessing their values, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities, and potential profitability, as well as the availability of capital.\nSystem failure or interruption may result in reduced traffic, reduced revenue and harm to our reputation.\nOur ability to provide timely, updated information depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems. Similarly, our ability to track, measure and report the delivery of advertisements on our Websites depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of third-party systems. Our operations depend in part on the protection of our data systems and those of our third-party providers against damage from human error, natural disasters, fire, power loss, water damage, telecommunications failure, computer viruses, terrorist acts, vandalism, sabotage, and other adverse events. Although we utilize the services of third-party cloud computing providers, specifically Amazon Web Services with procedural security systems and have put in place certain other disaster recovery measures, including offsite storage of backup data, these disaster recovery measures currently may not be comprehensive enough and there is no guarantee that our Internet access and other data operations will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Any system failure, including network, software or hardware failure, that causes an interruption in our service or a decrease in responsiveness of our Websites could result in reduced traffic, reduced revenue and harm to our reputation, brand and relations with our advertisers and strategic partners. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for such losses. In such event, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nDisruptions to our third-party technology providers and management systems could harm our business and lead to loss of customers and advertisers.\nWe depend on third-party technology providers and management systems to distribute our content and process transactions. For example, we use Fastly and Amazon Web Services to help us efficiently distribute our content to customers. We also use a third-party vendor to process credit cards for our subscriptions. We exercise no control over our third-party vendors, which makes us vulnerable to any errors, interruptions, or delays in their operations. Any disruption in the services provided by these vendors could have significant adverse impacts on our business reputation, advertiser and customer relations and operating results. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us, and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nWe may face liability for, or incur costs to defend, information published in our services.\nFrom time to time we are subject to claims for defamation, libel, copyright or trademark infringement, fraud or negligence, or other theories of liability, in each case relating to the articles, commentary, investment recommendations, ratings, or other information we provide through our services. We maintain insurance to provide coverage with respect to such claims, but our insurance may not adequately protect us against these claims. For example, from time to time, actions filed against us include claims for punitive damages, which are excluded from coverage under our insurance policies.\nFailure to establish and maintain successful strategic relationships with other companies could decrease our subscriber and user base.\nWe rely in part on establishing and maintaining successful strategic relationships with other companies to attract and retain a portion of our current subscriber and reader base and to enhance public awareness of our brands. In particular, our relationships with Yahoo! Finance, MSN and CNN Business, which index our headlines and/or host our content including our video offerings, have been important components of our effort to enhance public awareness of our brands, which awareness we believe also is enhanced by the public appearances of James J. Cramer, in particular on his \u201cMad Money\u201d television program and on \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d, both of which are telecast by CNBC. If we do not successfully establish and maintain our strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if these relationships do not attract significant revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to maintain our reputation for trustworthiness may harm our business.\nOur brand is based upon the integrity of our editorial content. We are proud of the trust and reputation for quality we have developed over the course of 21 years and we seek to renew and deepen that trust continually. We require all of our content contributors, whether employees or outside contributors, to adhere to strict standards of integrity, including standards that are designed to prevent any actual or potential conflict of interest, and to comply with all applicable laws, including securities laws. The occurrence of events such as our misreporting a news story, the non-disclosure of a stock ownership position by one or more of our content contributors, the manipulation of a security by one or more of our content contributors, or any other breach of our compliance policies, could harm our reputation for trustworthiness and reduce readership. In addition, in the event the reputation of any of our directors, officers, key contributors, writers or editorial staff were harmed for any other reason, we could suffer as result of our association with the individual, and also could suffer if the quantity or value of future services we received from the individual was diminished. These events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not adequately protect our own intellectual property and may incur costs to defend against, or face liability for, intellectual property infringement claims of others.\nTo protect our intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d), we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patent protection, confidentiality agreements and various other contractual arrangements with our employees, affiliates, customers, strategic partners and others. We own several trademark registrations and copyrights, and have pending trademark and patent applications, in the United States. In addition, our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, employee handbook, and other internal policies seek to protect our IP against misappropriation, infringement, and unfair competition. We also utilize various tools to police the Internet to monitor piracy and unauthorized use of our content. Finally, whether we are contracting out our IP or licensing third-party content and/or technology, we incorporate contractual provisions to protect our IP and seek indemnification for any third-party infringement claims.\nHowever, we cannot provide any guarantee that the foregoing provisions will be adequate to protect us from third-party claims or that these provisions will prevent the theft of our IP, as we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our IP rights. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, any infringement claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face government regulation and legal uncertainties.\nWe are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly-owned companies, as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, including privacy regulations and taxes levied adopted at the local, state, national and international levels. In recent years, consumer protection regulations, particularly in connection with the Internet, have become more aggressive, and we expect that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national and international levels. Such new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business due to increased compliance costs.\nAny failure of our internal security measures or breach of our privacy protections could cause us to lose users and subject us to liability.\nUsers who subscribe to our paid subscription services are required to furnish certain personal information (including name, mailing address, phone number, email address and credit card information), which we use to administer our services. We also require users of some of our free services and features to provide us with some personal information during the membership registration process. Additionally, we rely on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties to perform real-time credit card authorization and verification, and at times rely on third parties, including technology consulting firms, to help protect our infrastructure from security threats. We may have to continue to expend capital and other resources on the hardware and software infrastructure that provides security for our processing, storage and transmission of personal information.\nIn this regard, our users depend on us to keep their personal information safe and private and not to disclose it to third parties or permit our security to be breached. However, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments, including improper acts by third parties, may result in a compromise or breach of the security measures we use to protect the personal information of our users. If a party were to compromise or breach our information security measures or those of our agents, such party could misappropriate the personal information of our users, cause interruptions in our operations, expose us to significant liabilities and reporting obligations, damage our reputation and discourage potential users from registering to use our Websites or other services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe utilize various third parties to assist with various aspects of our business. Some of these partnerships require the exchange of user information. This is required because some features of our Websites may be hosted by these third parties. While we take significant measures to guarantee the security of our customer data and require such third parties to comply with our privacy and security policies as well as generally be contractually bound to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to any claims related to any breach of relevant privacy laws related to the service provider, we are still at risk if any of these third-party systems are breached or compromised and may in such event suffer a material adverse effect to business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u25cf not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u25cf permitting an amendment of our certificate of incorporation only through a super-majority vote of the stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u25cf requiring that, to the fullest extent permitted by law and unless we consent to an alternate forum, certain proceedings against or involving us or our directors, officers, or employees be brought exclusively in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware;\n\u25cf limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u25cf requiring advance notification for stockholder director nominations and other proposals.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock would be subject to delisting. The liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if our common stock is delisted and could cause our trading price to decline.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cTST.\u201d\nWe are required to meet continued listing standards in order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the requirement that the minimum bid price of a listed company\u2019s stock be at or above $1.00. In the event that we are unable to satisfy these continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. Any delisting of our common stock from such market could adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock, reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our common stock trades and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders. In addition, delisting of our common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common stock, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the sale of our B2B business along with a portion of our current cash on hand are distributed to our stockholders, the market price of our common stock will likely be adversely affected and we may fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could result in the delisting of our common stock.\nThe continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market include, among other things, requirements that we maintain certain levels of stockholders\u2019 equity, net income from continuing operations or market capitalization and a minimum trading price. Even though we currently satisfy these requirements, we intend to distribute a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the sale of our B2B business along with a portion of our current cash on hand to our stockholders. A distribution to our stockholders will likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock following such distribution. In such an event, we may not be able to meet the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market unless we effect a reverse stock split to increase the per share market price of our common stock. Therefore, the Board of Directors may determine to effect a reverse stock split in order to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We cannot assure you, however, that a reverse stock split will accomplish this objective for any meaningful period of time, if at all. While it is expected that the reduction in the number of outstanding shares of common stock resulting from a reverse stock split would proportionally increase the market price of our common stock, we cannot assure you that a reverse stock split will increase the market price of our common stock by a multiple of the reverse stock split ratio chosen by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, or result in any permanent or sustained increase in the market price of our common stock, which is dependent upon many factors, including our business and financial performance, general market conditions, and prospects for future success.\nConcentrated ownership of our stock can influence stockholder decisions, may discourage a change in control, and may have an adverse effect on share price of our stock.\nInvestors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock. Our directors, executive officers, and our five percent or greater stockholders as a group, own or control approximately 60% of our common stock. This ownership concentration may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control, and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares. Also as a result of their ownership, our directors, executive officers, and our five percent or greater stockholders as a group, may have the ability to influence the outcome of any matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors.\nThis concentration of ownership could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay for our common stock, and could discourage or delay a change of control, which other stockholders may favor. The interests of our directors, executive officers and our five percent or greater stockholders may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock, and they may take actions affecting us with which other stockholders disagree.\nIf our ability to use our tax operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes is limited, we may not receive the benefit of those assets.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $150 million as of December 31, 2018, available to offset future taxable income through 2037. These net operating losses date back to December 1999 and will begin expiring in 2019. A significant portion of these net operating losses were used to offset gains from the sales of RateWatch and our B2B business. Following these transactions, $85.6 million of net operating loss carryforwards remain. Our ability to fully utilize these remaining net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income before the expiration of the carryforward period attributable to these net operating losses. Furthermore, as a result of prior ownership changes under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a portion of these net operating losses will be subject to certain limitations.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors\u2019 views of us could be harmed.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We have evaluated and tested our internal controls in order to allow management to report on our internal controls, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we are not able to meet the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we would be required to disclose material weaknesses if they develop or are uncovered and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any such action could negatively impact the perception of us in the financial market and our business.\nIn addition, our internal controls may not prevent or detect all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. As a smaller reporting company, we were not required to have our independent auditors report on our internal controls for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 86924, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TST"}
