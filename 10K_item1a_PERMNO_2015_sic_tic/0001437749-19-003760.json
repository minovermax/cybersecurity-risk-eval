RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating us and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in \u201cRisk Factor\u201d are forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in the report:\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Operation\nOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of our geothermal and REG power plants, which are subject to various operational risks.\nOur financial performance depends on the successful operation of our geothermal and REG power plants. In connection with such operations, we derived 70.9% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the sale of electricity. The cost of operation and maintenance and the operating performance of our geothermal power and REG plants may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf\nregular and unexpected maintenance and replacement expenditures;\n\u25cf\nshutdowns due to the breakdown or failure of our equipment or the equipment of the transmission serving utility;\n\u25cf\nlabor disputes;\n\u25cf\nthe presence of hazardous materials on our power plant sites;\n\u25cf\ncontinued availability of cooling water supply;\n\u25cf\ncatastrophic events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes, volcanic activity, landslides, floods, releases of hazardous materials, severe weather storms, or similar occurrences affecting our power plants or any of the power purchasers or other third parties providing services to our power plants, such as the recent volcanic eruption that occurred in Hawaii's Big Island that impacted our Puna project, as discussed elsewhere in this Report; and\n\u25cf\nthe aging of power plants (which may reduce their availability and increase the cost of their maintenance).\nAny of these events could significantly increase the expenses incurred by our power plants or reduce the overall generating capacity of our power plants and could significantly reduce or entirely eliminate the revenues generated by one or more of our power plants, which in turn would reduce our net income and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flows.\nOur exploration, development, and operation of geothermal energy resources are subject to geological risks and uncertainties, which may result in decreased performance or increased costs for our power plants.\nOur primary business involves the exploration, development, and operation of geothermal energy resources. These activities are subject to uncertainties that, in certain respects, are similar to those typically associated with oil and gas exploration, development, and exploitation, such as dry holes, uncontrolled releases, and pressure and temperature decline. Any of these uncertainties may increase our capital expenditures and our operating costs or reduce the efficiency of our power plants. We may not find geothermal resources capable of supporting a commercially viable power plant at exploration sites where we have conducted tests, acquired land rights, and drilled test wells, which would adversely affect our development of geothermal power plants. Further, since the commencement of their operations, several of our power plants have experienced geothermal resource cooling, uncontrolled flow and/or reservoir pressure decline in the normal course of operations. Because geothermal reservoirs are complex geological structures, we can only estimate their geographic area and sustainable output. The viability of geothermal power plants depends on different factors directly related to the geothermal resource (such as the temperature, pressure, storage capacity, transmissivity, and recharge) as well as operational factors relating to the extraction or reinjection of geothermal fluids. Our geothermal energy power plants may also suffer an unexpected decline in the capacity of their respective geothermal wells and are exposed to a risk of geothermal reservoirs not being sufficient for sustained generation of the electrical power capacity desired over time.\nAnother aspect of geothermal operations is the management and stabilization of subsurface impacts caused by fluid injection pressures of production and injection fluids to mitigate subsidence. In the case of the geothermal resource supplying the Heber complex, pressure drawdown in the center of the well field has caused some localized ground subsidence, while pressure in the peripheral areas has caused localized ground inflation. Inflation and subsidence, if not controlled, can adversely affect farming operations and other infrastructure at or near the land surface. Costs of failing to stabilize site pressures in the Heber Complex area include repair and modification of gravity-based farm irrigation systems and municipal sewer piping and repair or replacement of a local road bridge spanning an irrigation canal.\nAdditionally, active geothermal areas, such as the areas in which our power plants are located, are subject to frequent low-level seismic disturbances. Also, volcanic eruptions and lava flows may happen in Hawaii, Guatemala and Indonesia. Serious seismic disturbances, volcanic eruptions and lava flows are possible and could result in damage to our power plants (or transmission lines used by customers who buy electricity from us) or equipment or degrade the quality of our geothermal resources to such an extent that we could not perform under the PPA for the affected power plant, which in turn could reduce our net income and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. If we suffer a serious seismic disturbance, volcanic eruptions and lava flows, our business interruption and property damage insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses sustained as a result thereof. In addition, insurance coverage may not continue to be available in the future in amounts adequate to insure against such seismic disturbances, volcanic eruptions and lava flows.\nOn May 3, 2018, the Kilauea volcano located in close proximity to our Puna 38 MW geothermal power plant in the Puna district of Hawaii's Big Island erupted following a significant increase in seismic activity in the area. Before it recently stopped flowing, the lava covered the wellheads of three geothermal wells, monitoring wells and the substation of the Puna complex and an adjacent warehouse that stored a drilling rig that was also consumed by the lava. The insurance policy coverage for property and business interruption is provided by a consortium of insurers. All the insurers accepted and started paying for the costs to rebuild the destroyed substation, and as of December 31, 2018 we received $3.3 million. However only some of the insurers accepted that the business interruption coverage started in May 2018 and as of December 31, 2018 we recorded $12.1 million of such proceeds. We are still in discussions to reach an understanding with all insurers to start paying for the business interruption as of May 2018. The Company is still assessing the damages in the Puna facilities and continue to coordinate with HELCO and local authorities to bring the power plant back to operation. The Company continues to assess the accounting implications of this event on the assets and liabilities on its balance sheet and whether an impairment will be required. Any significant physical damage to the geothermal resource or continued shut-down following the recent stop of the lava of the Puna facilities could have an adverse impact on the power plant's electricity generation and availability, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to our power plant in Puna, Hawaii, our power plant in Amatitlan, Guatemala is located in proximity to an active volcano. As a result of recent events impacting our Puna facility, we cannot be certain how investors will assess the risks to which our facilities are subject and whether this assessment will adversely impact perceptions of our business and our share price.\nFurthermore, absent additional geologic/hydrologic studies, any increase in power generation from our geothermal power plants, failure to reinject the geothermal fluid or improper maintenance of the hydrological balance may affect the operational duration of the geothermal resource and cause it to decline in value over time and may adversely affect our ability to generate power from the relevant power plant.\nWe may decide not to implement, or may not be successful in implementing, one or more elements of our multi-year strategic plan, and the plan as implemented may not achieve its goal of enhancing shareholder value through long-term growth of the Company\nWe adopted a multi-year strategic plan to:\n\u25cf\nexpand our geographic base;\n\u25cf\nexpand into new technologies, such as energy storage and solar PV electric power generation both in large \u201cutility scale\u201d projects and smaller C&I projects for commercial, industrial, governmental, educational and other institutional customers; and\n\u25cf\nexpand our customer base.\nThere are uncertainties and risks associated with the plan, both as to implementation and outcome. We may decide to change, or to not implement, one or more elements of the plan over time or we may not be successful in implementing one or more elements of the plan, in each case for a number of reasons. For example, we may face significant challenges and risks expanding into new technologies (or expanding our geographical or customer base for those new technologies), including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to compete with the large number of other companies pursuing similar business opportunities in energy storage and solar PV power generation, many of which already have established businesses in these areas and/or have greater financial, strategic, technological or other resources than we have;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, or at all, which we may need, for example, to obtain any technology, personnel, intellectual property, or to acquire one or more existing businesses as a platform for our expansion, or to fund internal research and development, for energy storage and solar PV electric power generation products and services;\n\u25cf\nour ability to provide energy storage or solar electric power generation products or services that keep pace with rapidly changing technology, customer preferences, equipment costs, market conditions and other factors that are unknown to us now that will impact these markets;\n\u25cf\nour ability to devote the amount of management time and other resources required to implement this plan, while continuing to grow our core geothermal and recovered energy businesses; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to recruit appropriate employees.\nExpanding our geothermal and recovered energy businesses to new customers and geographical areas will have many of the same risks and uncertainties as those outlined above.\nImplementing the plan may also involve various costs, including, among other things:\n\u25cf\nopportunity costs associated with foregone alternative uses of our resources;\n\u25cf\nvarious expense items that will impact our current financial results; and\n\u25cf\nasset revaluations (for example, businesses or other assets acquired for new energy storage or solar PV power generation products or services may suffer impairment charges, as a result of rapidly changing technology, market conditions or otherwise).\nThese costs may not be recovered, in whole or in part, if one or more elements of the plan are not successfully implemented. These costs, or the failure to implement successfully one or more elements of the plan, could adversely affect our reputation and the reputation of our subsidiaries and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nApart from the risks associated with implementing the plan, the plan itself will expose us to other risks and uncertainties once implemented. Expanding our customer base may expose us to different credit profile customers than our current customers. Expanding our geographic base will subject us to risks associated with doing business in new foreign countries in which we will have to learn the business and political environment. In addition, expanding into new technologies will expose us to new risks and uncertainties that are unknown to us now in addition to the risks and uncertainties that may be similar to those we now face. The success of the plan, once implemented, will depend, among other things, on our ability to manage these risks effectively.\nThe trading price of our common stock could decline if securities, industry analysts or our investors disagree with our strategic plan or the way we implement it accordingly, there is no assurance that the plan will enhance shareholder value through long-term growth of the Company to the extent currently anticipated by our management or at all.\nConcentration of customers and regions may expose us to heightened financial exposure.\nOur businesses often rely on a single customer to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility\u2019s output. The financial performance of these facilities depends on such customer continuing to perform its obligations under a long-term agreement between the parties. A facility\u2019s financial results could be materially and adversely affected if any of our customers fail to fulfill its contractual obligations and we are unable to find other customers to purchase at the same level of profitability. We cannot assure that such performance failures by our customers will not occur, or that if they do occur, such failures will not adversely affect the cash flows or profitability of our businesses.\nFor example, in the Electricity segment, we are exposed to the credit and financial condition of KPLC that buy the power generated from our Olkaria III in Kenya. In 2018, KPLC accounted for 16.6% of our total revenues. Any change in KPLC's financial condition may adversely affect us. Another example, we are exposed to the credit and financial condition of SCPPA and its municipal utility members that account for 15.2% of our total revenues, as customers that buy the output from seven of our geothermal power plants. Because our contracts with SCPPA are long-term, we may be adversely affected if the credit quality of any of these customers were to decline or if their respective financial conditions were to deteriorate or if they are otherwise unable to perform their obligations under our long-term contracts.\nAnother example, Pacific Gas & Electric who accounted for approximately 1.9% of our total revenues, is facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. If Pacific Gas & Electric is found liable for the wildfires, its potential liabilities could exceed $30B. As a result, on January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. We are closely monitoring our Pacific Gas & Electric account to ensure cash receipts are received timely each month. However, we cannot estimate at this stage the impact that this Chapter 11 reorganization may have on us.\nIn the Product segment, 23.5% and 83.6% of our 2018 total revenues and Products segment revenue, respectively, derived from our operation in Turkey and we rely on the continued geothermal development growth and government support for geothermal development in the country. Our revenue exposure to the Turkish market increased in 2018 and expects to remain significant in 2019, as we signed a number of new contracts in Turkey. Adverse political developments in the relationship between Turkey and the U.S., adverse economic developments in this region including the latest failed coup, devaluation of the Turkish Lira, a general slowdown in the Turkish economy and an inability to obtain project and bank financing or a decline in government support for the development of geothermal power in the country could materially and adversely affect regional demand for the geothermal equipment and services we provide in the Turkish market or the prices we may charge for such equipment and services, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our Product segment profit margins and, consequently, our business, financial condition, future results and cash flows.\nOrmat established a facility in Turkey in order to locally produce several power plant components that entitle our customer for increased incentives under the renewable energy laws. The use of local equipment in renewable energy based generating facilities in Turkey entitles such facilities to significant benefits under Turkish law, provided such facilities have obtained an RER Certificate from EMRA, which requires the issuance of a local certificate. If we do not obtain the local certificate, then some of our customers under the relevant supply agreements in Turkey may not be issued a RER Certificate based on the equipment we supply to them, and we will be required to make a payment to such customers equal to the amount of the expected lost benefit\nOur international operations expose us to risks related to the application of foreign laws and regulations, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flows.\nOur foreign operations in Kenya, Turkey, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Honduras and other countries are subject to regulation by various foreign governments and regulatory authorities and are subject to the application of foreign laws. Such foreign laws or regulations may not provide the same type of legal certainty and rights, in connection with our contractual relationships in such countries, as are afforded to our operations in the U.S., which may adversely affect our ability to receive revenues or enforce our rights in connection with our foreign operations. The systems of some of these countries can be characterized by:\n\u2022\nselective or inconsistent enforcement of laws or regulations, sometimes in ways that have been perceived as being motivated by political or financial considerations;\n\u2022\na perceived lack of judicial and prosecutorial independence from political, social and commercial forces;\n\u2022\na high degree of discretion on the part of the judiciary and governmental authorities;\n\u2022\nlegal and bureaucratic obstacles and corruption; and\n\u2022\nrapid evolution of legal systems in ways that may not always coincide with market developments.\nThese characteristics give rise to investment risks that do not exist in countries with more established legal systems in more developed economies.\nWe face additional risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with laws and regulations of many jurisdictions that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, economic sanctions, export requirements, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees (or third parties acting on our behalf), our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violation could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nFurthermore, existing laws or regulations may be amended or repealed, and new laws or regulations may be enacted or issued. In addition, the laws and regulations of some countries may limit our ability to hold a majority interest in some of the power plants that we may develop or acquire, thus limiting our ability to control the development, construction and operation of such power plants, or our ability to import our products into such countries.\nPolitical and economic conditions in the emerging economies where we operate may subject us to greater risk than in the developed U.S. economy, which may have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe have substantial operations outside of the U.S., both in our Electricity segment and our Product segment. In 2018, 54% of our total revenues were derived from international operations, and our international operations were significantly more profitable than our U.S. operations. A substantial portion of international revenues came from Kenya and Turkey and, to a lesser extent, from Guadeloupe, Guatemala and Honduras and other countries. Thus, disturbances to and challenges facing our foreign operations, especially in Kenya and Turkey, could have impacts on our business ranging from moderate to severe. Our foreign operations subject us to significant political, economic and financial risks, which vary by country, and include:\n\u2022\nchanges in government policies or personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on currency transfer or convertibility;\n\u2022\nthe adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence or escalation of a \u201ctrade war,\u201d or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies among the governments of the United States and countries where we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor relations;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and civil unrest, and risk of war;\n\u2022\nchanges in the local electricity and/or geothermal markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations;\n\u2022\nbreach or repudiation of important contractual undertakings by governmental entities; and\n\u2022\nexpropriation and confiscation of assets and facilities, including without adequate compensation.\nElectricity Segment. In 2018, the international operations of the Electricity segment accounted for 28% of our revenues, but accounted for 53% of our gross profit, 77% of our net income and 53% of our EBITDA. A substantial portion of Electricity segment international revenues came from Kenya (which also contributed disproportionately to our gross profit and net income) and, to a lesser extent, from Guadeloupe, Guatemala and Honduras. In Kenya, any break-up or potential privatization of KPLC, the power purchase for our power plants located in Kenya, may adversely affect our Olkaria III complex and our overall results of operations. Additionally, in Guatemala the electricity sector was partially privatized, and it is currently unclear whether further privatization will occur in the future. Such developments may affect our Amatitlan and Zunil power plants if, for example, they result in changes to the prevailing tariff regime or in the identity and creditworthiness of our power purchasers.\nProduct Segment. With respect to our Product segment, 93% of our Product segment revenues in 2018 came from international sales, primarily Turkey. Since we primarily engage in sales in those markets where there is a geothermal reservoir, any such change might adversely affect geothermal developers in those markets and, subsequently, the ability of such developers to purchase our products.\nGenerally. Outbreaks of civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism have also occurred in several countries in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, where we have significant operations, such as Kenya and Turkey. For instance, Kenya experienced numerous terrorist attacks in 2014 and 2015, and has experienced an upsurge in attacks in more recent years, including in early 2019, from extremist groups. Continued or escalated civil and political unrest and acts of terrorism in the countries in which we operate could result in our curtailing operations. In the event that countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating of the established government, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired. Although we generally obtain political risk insurance in connection with our foreign power plants, such political risk insurance does not mitigate all of the above-mentioned risks. In addition, insurance proceeds received pursuant to our political risk insurance policies, where applicable, may not be adequate to cover all losses sustained as a result of any covered risks and may at times be pledged in favor of the power plant lenders as collateral. Also, insurance may not be available in the future with the scope of coverage and in amounts of coverage adequate to insure against such risks and disturbances. Any or all of the changes discussed above could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nTwo of our facilities accounts for 26% of our revenues and contribute significantly to our profitability.\nOur business relies significantly on the performance of our two largest projects, the McGinness Hills complex in East Nevada and Olkaria III Complex in Kenya, which together account for more than 30% of the total generating capacity of our Electricity segment. These two facilities accounted for 26% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Just over one third of the generating capacity at McGinness Hills reached commercial operation in December 2018 and its contribution to our results may therefore be higher in the future. Any disruption to the operation of these facilities would have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and on our profitability compared to our other facilities.\nConditions in and around Israel, where the majority of our senior management and our main production and manufacturing facilities are located, may adversely affect our operations and may limit our ability to produce and sell our products or manage our power plants.\nThe majority of our senior management and our main production and manufacturing facilities are located in Israel approximately 26 miles from the border with the Gaza Strip. As such, political, economic and security conditions in Israel directly affect our operations.\nThe political instability and civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa (including the ongoing civil war in Syria) as well as the increased tension between Iran and Israel have raised new concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict or other hostilities involving Israel. We could be adversely affected by any such hostilities, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. In addition, the sale of products manufactured in Israel may be adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws, policies or practices directed toward Israel or companies having operations in Israel.\nIn addition, some of our employees in Israel are subject to being called upon to perform military service in Israel, and their absence may have an adverse effect upon our operations.\nThese events and conditions could disrupt our operations in Israel, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results, and cash flow.\nWe have significant operations globally, including in countries that may be adversely affected by political or economic instability, major hostilities or acts of terrorism, which exposes us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally.\nWe have substantial operations outside of the U.S., both in our Electricity segment and our Product segment. Terrorist acts or other similar events could harm our business by limiting our ability to generate or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new generating facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets, and could adversely affect operations by contributing to the disruption of supplies and markets for geothermal and recovered energy. Such events could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.\nSome of our leases will terminate if we do not extract geothermal resources in \u201ccommercial quantities\u201d, thus requiring us to enter into new leases or secure rights to alternate geothermal resources, none of which may be available on terms as favorable to us as any such terminated lease, if at all.\nMost of our geothermal resource leases are for a fixed primary term, and then continue for so long as geothermal resources are extracted in \u201ccommercial quantities\u201d or pursuant to other terms of extension. The land covered by some of our leases (approximately 249,000 acres) is undeveloped and has not yet produced geothermal resources in commercial quantities. Leases that cover land which remains undeveloped and does not produce, or does not continue to produce, geothermal resources in commercial quantities and leases that we allow to expire, may terminate. In the event that a lease is terminated and we determine that we will need that lease once the applicable power plant is operating, we would need to enter into one or more new leases with the owner(s) of the premises that are the subject of the terminated lease(s) in order to develop geothermal resources from, or inject geothermal resources into, such premises or secure rights to alternate geothermal resources or lands suitable for injection. We may not be able to do this or may not be able to do so without incurring increased costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nOur BLM leases may be terminated if we fail to comply with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act or if we fail to comply with the terms or stipulations of such leases, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nPursuant to the terms of our BLM leases, we are required to conduct our operations on BLM-leased land in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable laws and BLM directives and to take all mitigating actions required by the BLM to protect the surface of and the environment surrounding the relevant land. Additionally, certain BLM leases contain additional requirements, some of which relate to the mitigation or avoidance of disturbance of any antiquities, cultural values or threatened or endangered plants or animals. In the event of a default under any BLM lease, or the failure to comply with such requirements, or any non-compliance with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act or regulations issued thereunder, the BLM may, 30 days after notice of default is provided to our relevant project subsidiary, suspend our operations until the requested action is taken or terminate the lease, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nSome of our leases (or subleases) could terminate if the lessor (or sublessor) under any such lease (or sublease) defaults on any debt secured by the relevant property, thus terminating our rights to access the underlying geothermal resources at that location.\nThe fee interest in the land which is the subject of some of our leases (or subleases) may currently be or may become subject to encumbrances securing loans from third-party lenders to the lessor (or sublessor). Our rights as lessee (or sublessee) under such leases (or subleases) are or may be subject and subordinate to the rights of any such lender. Accordingly, a default by the lessor (or sublessor) under any such loan could result in a foreclosure on the underlying fee interest in the property and thereby terminate our leasehold interest and result in the shutdown of the power plant located on the relevant property and/or terminate our right of access to the underlying geothermal resources required for our operations.\nReduced levels of recovered energy required for the operation of our REG power plants may result in decreased performance of such power plants.\nOur REG power plants generate electricity from recovered energy or so-called \u201cwaste heat\u201d that is generated as a residual by-product of gas turbine-driven compressor stations and a variety of industrial processes. Any interruption in the supply of the recovered energy source, such as a result of reduced gas flows in the pipelines or reduced level of operation at the compressor stations, or in the output levels of the various industrial processes, may cause an unexpected decline in the capacity and performance of our recovered energy power plants.\nOur business development activities may not be successful and our projects under construction may not commence operation as scheduled.\nWe are in the process of developing and constructing a number of new power plants. Our success in developing a project is contingent upon, among other things, negotiation of satisfactory engineering and construction agreements and obtaining PPAs and transmission services agreements, receipt of required governmental permits, obtaining adequate financing, and the timely implementation and satisfactory completion of field development, testing and power plant construction and commissioning. We may be unsuccessful in accomplishing any of these matters or doing so on a timely basis. Although we may attempt to minimize the financial risks attributable to the development of a project by securing a favorable PPA and applicable transmission services agreements, obtaining all required governmental permits and approvals and arranging, in certain cases, adequate financing prior to the commencement of construction, the development of a power project may require us to incur significant expenses for preliminary engineering, permitting and legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or capable of being financed.\nCurrently, we have geothermal projects and prospects under exploration, development or construction in the U.S., as well as in Ethiopia, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia and New Zealand, and we intend to pursue the expansion of some of our existing plants and the development of other new plants. Our completion of these facilities is subject to substantial risks, including:\n\u25cf\ninability to secure a PPA;\n\u25cf\ninability to secure transmission services agreements;\n\u25cf\ninability to secure the required financing;\n\u25cf\ncost increases and delays due to unanticipated shortages of adequate resources to execute the project such as equipment, material and labor;\n\u25cf\nwork stoppages resulting from force majeure event including riots, strikes and whether conditions;\n\u25cf\ninability to obtain permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nfailure to secure sufficient land positions for the wellfield, power plant and rights of way;\n\u25cf\nfailure by key contractors and vendors to timely and properly perform, including where we use equipment manufactured by others;\n\u25cf\ninability to secure or delays in securing the required transmission line and/or capacity;\n\u25cf\nadverse environmental and geological conditions (including inclement weather conditions);\n\u25cf\nadverse local business law; and\n\u25cf\nour attention to other projects and activities, including those in the solar energy and energy storage sectors.\nAny one of these could give rise to delays, cost overruns, the termination of the plant expansion, construction or development or the loss (total or partial) of our interest in the project under development, construction, or expansion.\nWe rely on power transmission facilities that we do not own or control.\nWe depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the power we sell from our power plants to our customers. If transmission is disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, of if there is a failure that requires long shutdown for repair, or if curtailment is required due to load and inefficiency system, our ability to sell and deliver power to our customers may be adversely impacted and we may either incur additional costs or forego revenues. In addition, lack of access to new transmission capacity may affect our ability to develop new projects. Existing congestion of transmission capacity, as well as expansion of transmission systems and competition from other developers seeking access to expanded systems, could also affect our performance.\nOur use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.\nWe have partners in several of our plants and we may continue in the future to develop and/or acquire and/or hold properties in joint ventures with other entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Ownership of assets in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including:\n\u25cf\nwe could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes, including arbitration or litigation;\n\u25cf\nour joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments in the projects that are owned by the joint ventures, which could affect decisions about future capital expenditures, major operational expenditures and retirement of assets, among other things;\n\u25cf\nour ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited;\n\u25cf\nour joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, and this could impact our ability to fully take advantage of federal tax incentives available for renewable energy projects;\n\u25cf\nour joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and\n\u25cf\nour joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets and investments in companies that compete directly or indirectly with us that could create conflict of interest issues.\nSeasonal variations may cause fluctuations in our cash flows, which may cause the market price of our common stock to fall in certain periods.\nOur results of operations are subject to seasonal variations. This is primarily because some of our power plants may experience reduced generation during warm periods due to the lower heat differential between the geothermal fluid and the ambient surroundings. Such seasonal variations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. If our operating results fall below the public\u2019s or analysts\u2019 expectations in some future period or periods, the market price of our common stock will likely fall in such period or periods.\nStorage projects that we are currently developing or plan to develop in the future may operate as \"merchant\" facilities without long-term power services agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output and therefore such projects will be exposed to market fluctuations.\nStorage projects that we own and operate, as well others we are currently developing or plan to develop in the future, may operate as \"merchant\" facilities without long-term sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output and therefore such projects are exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term services agreements for these assets, we cannot be sure that we will be able to sell any or all of the power and ancillary services generated by these facilities at commercially attractive rates or that these facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairments of our property, plant and equipment or to the closing of certain of our storage facilities, resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate companies, which we acquired and may acquire in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nOur strategy is to continue to expand in the future, including through acquisitions. Integrating acquisitions is often costly, and we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies with our existing operations without substantial costs, delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences. Integrating our acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, including:\n\u25cf\nfailure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect;\n\u25cf\ninability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf\nrisks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities; and\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including accounting controls and procedures.\nIf any of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems, this could adversely affect the reputation of our group of companies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nThe power generation industry is characterized by intense competition, and we encounter competition from electric utilities, other power producers, and power marketers that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nThe power generation industry is characterized by intense competition from electric utilities, other power producers and power marketers. In recent years, there has been increasing competition in the sale of electricity, in part due to excess capacity in a number of U.S. markets and an emphasis on short-term or \u201cspot\u201d markets, and competition has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices. For the most part, we expect that power purchasers interested in long-term arrangements will engage in \u201ccompetitive bid\u201d solicitations to satisfy new capacity demands. This competition could adversely affect our ability to obtain and/or renew long-term PPAs and the price paid for electricity by the relevant power purchasers. There is also increasing competition between electric utilities. This competition has put pressure on electric utilities to lower their costs, including the cost of purchased electricity, and increasing competition in the future will put further pressure on power purchasers to reduce the prices at which they purchase electricity from us.\nWe face increasing competition from other companies engaged in the solar, energy storage, demand response and energy management sectors.\nThe solar power market is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete with many companies that have longer operating histories in this sector, larger customer bases, and greater brand recognition, as well as, in some cases, significantly greater financial and marketing resources than us. In some cases, these competitors are vertically integrated in the solar energy sector, manufacturing Solar PV panels, silicon wafers, and other related products for the solar industry, which may give them an advantage in developing, constructing, owning and operating solar power projects. Our limited experience in the Solar PV sector may affect our ability to successfully develop, construct, finance, and operate Solar PV power projects.\nWe are experiencing intense competition in the energy storage, demand response and energy management markets. Our competitors in the energy storage, demand response and energy management markets include utilities, independent power producers, developers, new start-ups, and third-party investors, who compete more successfully in these markets than our Viridity business. If we are unable, as a result of increased competition, to expand our customer base or increase our market share in these rapidly growing markets, our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in costs and technology may significantly impact our business by making our power plants and products less competitive.\nA basic premise of our business model is that generating baseload power at geothermal power plants produces electricity at a competitive price. However, traditional coal-fired systems and gas-fired systems may under certain economic conditions produce electricity at lower average prices than our geothermal plants. In addition, there are other technologies that can produce electricity such as hydroelectric systems, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, energy storage systems and solar PV systems. Some of these alternative technologies currently produce electricity at a higher average price than our geothermal plants while others produce electricity at a lower average price, It is possible that technological advances and economies of scale will further reduce the cost of alternate methods of power generation. It is also possible that energy technologies will compete with our basic premise of a firm (non-intermittent) renewable baseload power source by combining renewable technologies with energy storage to provide an alternative to firm baseload energy. If this were to happen, the competitive advantage of our power plants may be significantly impaired.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business.\nOur existing intellectual property rights, including those we acquired in connection with the acquisition of our Viridity business, may not be adequate to protect our business. While we occasionally file patent applications, patents may not be issued on the basis of such applications or, if patents are issued, they may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any patents issued to us or for which we have use rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.\nIn order to safeguard our unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technology, we rely primarily upon trade secret protection and non-disclosure provisions in agreements with employees and others having access to confidential information. These measures may not adequately protect us from disclosure or misappropriation of our proprietary information.\nEven if we adequately protect our intellectual property rights, litigation may be necessary to enforce these rights, which could result in substantial costs to us and a substantial diversion of management attention. Also, while we have attempted to ensure that our technology and the operation of our business do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents and proprietary rights, our competitors or other parties may assert that certain aspects of our business or technology may be covered by patents held by them. Infringement or other intellectual property claims, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, can be expensive and time-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and subsequently restated certain of our financial statements as a result of factors related to that weakness. This may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements and impact our reputation, business and the price of our common stock, as well as lead to a loss of investor confidence in us.\nIn connection with the change in our repatriation strategy and the related release of the U.S. income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2017, we did not perform an effective risk assessment related to our internal controls over the accounting for income taxes. As a result, we identified a deficiency in the design of our internal control over financial reporting related to our accounting for income taxes, which affected the recording of income tax accounts by us in our interim and annual consolidated financial statements during 2017. Our management previously concluded that this deficiency constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and, accordingly, our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nOn May 16, 2018, we concluded that we would restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 to correct for (i) errors in our income tax provision, primarily related to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) prior to their expiration starting in 2027 and the resulting impact on the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and (ii) the inappropriate netting of certain deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities across different tax jurisdictions that was not permissible under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, we also concluded that we would revise our previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 to correct for errors in our income tax provision primarily related to the translation of deferred tax liabilities in a foreign subsidiary. These tax and tax-related errors also resulted in the restatement, for 2017, and revision, for 2016, of the Company\u2019s previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2017, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.\nWhile we have developed and are in the process of implementing a plan to remediate this material weakness, there can be no assurance that this will occur within 2019. We may identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information accurately, to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and to otherwise comply with our reporting obligations under the federal securities laws, and in relation to covenants in certain debt facilities will likely be adversely affected. The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our Common Stock or any other securities we may issue, as well as lead to a loss of investor confidence in us.\nOur failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital.\nWe did not file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 within the timeframe required by the SEC, meaning we were not current in our reporting requirements with the SEC. Even though we have regained compliance with our SEC reporting obligations, we will be not be eligible to use a short-form registration statement on Form S-3 that would allow us to incorporate by reference our SEC reports into the registration statement, or to use \u201cshelf\u201d registration statements, until one year from the date we regained and maintain status as a current filer. If we wish to pursue a public offering during this time period, we would be required to file a long-form registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would likely take significantly longer than using a short-form registration statement on Form S-3, increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulations, Laws and Taxation\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in the legal and regulatory environment affecting our operations.\nAll of our power plants are subject to extensive regulation, and therefore changes in applicable laws or regulations, or interpretations of those laws and regulations, could result in increased compliance costs, the need for additional capital expenditures or the reduction of certain benefits currently available to our power plants. The structure of domestic and foreign federal, state and local energy regulation currently is, and may continue to be, subject to challenges, modifications, the imposition of additional regulatory requirements, and restructuring proposals. We or our power purchasers may not be able to obtain all regulatory approvals that may be required in the future, or any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals, or maintain all required regulatory approvals. In addition, the cost of operation and maintenance and the operating performance of geothermal power plants may be adversely affected by changes in certain laws and regulations, including tax laws.\nAny changes to applicable laws and regulations could significantly increase the regulatory-related compliance and other expenses incurred by the power plants and could significantly reduce or entirely eliminate the revenues generated by one or more of the power plants, which in turn would reduce our net income and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals, adopted by the SEC and requires us to disclose the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (including tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) in our products, may force us to incur additional expenses and may damage our relationship with certain customers. If we utilize any of these minerals and they are necessary to the production or functionality of any of our products or products we are contracted to manufacture, we will need to conduct specified due diligence activities and file with the SEC a report disclosing, among other things, whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. The implementation of these SEC rules could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components incorporated in our products. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products, and possibly additional expenses related to any changes to our products we may decide are advisable based upon our due diligence findings. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.\nPursuant to the terms of some of our PPAs with investor-owned electric utilities and publicly-owned electric utilities in states that have renewable portfolio standards, the failure to supply the contracted capacity and energy thereunder may result in the imposition of penalties.\nPursuant to the terms of certain of our PPAs, we may be required to make payments to the relevant power purchaser under certain conditions, such as shortfall in delivery of renewable energy and energy credits, and not meeting certain performance threshold requirements, as defined in the relevant PPA. The amount of payment required is dependent upon the level of shortfall in delivery or performance requirements and is recorded in the period the shortfall occurs. In addition, if we do not meet certain minimum performance requirements, the capacity of the relevant power plant may be permanently reduced. Any or all of these considerations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nThe SRAC for our power purchasers may decline, which would reduce our power plant revenues and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow\nUnder two of the PPAs for our power plants in California, the price that Southern California Edison pays is based upon its SRAC, which are the incremental costs that it would have incurred had it generated the relevant electricity itself or purchased such electricity from others. Under settlement agreements between Southern California Edison and a number of power generators in California that are Qualifying Facilities, including our subsidiaries, the energy price component payable by Southern California Edison was fixed through April 2012, but since then is based on Southern California Edison\u2019s SRAC, as determined by the CPUC. The SRAC may vary substantially on a monthly basis and are expected to be based primarily on natural gas prices for gas delivered to California as well as other factors. The levels of SRAC prices paid by Southern California Edison may decline following the expiration of the settlement agreements in, which in turn would reduce our power plant revenues derived from Southern California Edison under our PPAs and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nUnder the terms of a global settlement approved by CPUC (Global Settlement) SRAC for our Heber 2 and Mammoth G2 PPAs are tied to a formula with energy market heat rates. The Global Settlement further provides that after July 1, 2015 if the term of any of the PPAs we have for these power plants expires, Southern California Edison would have no obligation to purchase power from any of these plants that has a generating capacity in excess of 20 MW, which would apply to the PPAs for our Heber 2 power plant (37 MW contract capacity) with Southern California Edison. Our Mammoth G2 plant (10.5 MW contract capacity) will be entitled to a new standard offer PPA, with SRAC pricing and capacity payments as determined from time to time by the CPUC. The joint parties to the Global Settlement agreed that the utilities can request from FERC a waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation under PURPA for Qualifying Facilities above 20 MW and FERC has granted such waiver for these California utilities.\nIf any of our domestic power plants loses its current Qualifying Facility status under PURPA, or if amendments to PURPA are enacted that substantially reduce the benefits currently afforded to Qualifying Facilities, our domestic operations could be adversely affected.\nMost of our domestic power plants are Qualifying Facilities pursuant to PURPA, which largely exempts the power plants from the FPA, and certain state and local laws and regulations regarding rates and financial and organizational requirements for electric utilities.\nIf any of our domestic power plants were to lose its Qualifying Facility status, such power plant could become subject to the full scope of the FPA and applicable state regulation. The application of the FPA and other applicable state regulation to our domestic power plants could require our operations to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory regime that may be costly and greatly reduce our operational flexibility.\nIf a domestic power plant were to lose its Qualifying Facility status, it would become subject to full regulation as a public utility under the FPA, and the rates charged by such power plant pursuant to its PPAs may be subject to the review and approval of FERC. FERC, upon such review, may determine that the rates currently set forth in such PPAs are not appropriate and may set rates that are lower than the rates currently charged. In addition, FERC may require that the affected domestic power plant refund amounts previously paid by the relevant power purchaser to such power plant. Even if a power plant does not lose its Qualifying Facility status, pursuant to regulations issued by FERC for Qualifying Facility power plants above 20 MW, if a power plant\u2019s PPA is terminated or otherwise expires, and the subsequent sales are not made pursuant to a state\u2019s implementation of PURPA, that power plant will become subject to FERC\u2019s ratemaking jurisdiction under the FPA. Moreover, a loss of Qualifying Facility status also could permit the power purchaser, pursuant to the terms of the particular PPA, to cease taking and paying for electricity from the relevant power plant or, consistent with FERC precedent, to seek refunds of past amounts paid. This could cause the loss of some or all of our revenues payable pursuant to the related PPAs, result in significant liability for refunds of past amounts paid, or otherwise impair the value of our power plants. If a power purchaser were to cease taking and paying for electricity or seek to obtain refunds of past amounts paid, there can be no assurance that the costs incurred in connection with the power plant could be recovered through sales to other purchasers or that we would have sufficient funds to make such payments. In addition, the loss of Qualifying Facility status would be an event of default under the financing arrangements currently in place for some of our power plants, which would enable the lenders to exercise their remedies and enforce the liens on the relevant power plant.\nPursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC also has the authority to prospectively lift the mandatory obligation of a utility under PURPA to offer to purchase the electricity from a Qualifying Facility if the utility operates in a workably competitive market. Our existing PPAs between a Qualifying Facility and a utility are not affected. If, in addition to the California utilities\u2019 waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation for QF projects that exceed 20 MW described in the risk factor above, the utilities in the other regions in which our domestic power plants operate were to be relieved of the mandatory purchase obligation, they would not be required to purchase energy from the power plant in the region under Federal law upon termination of the existing PPA or with respect to new power plants, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. Moreover, FERC has the authority to modify its regulations relating to the utility\u2019s mandatory purchase obligation under PURPA, which could result in the reduction in the purchase obligation of California and other utilities to a level below 20 MW, or the elimination of the purchase obligation. If that were to occur it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nThe PURPA and QF described risks identified above are not likely to affect our Nevada based facilities that entered into PPAs with NV Energy as the off-taker after Nevada initially adopted its RPS in 2001. Those PPAs and the related rates agreed to for such facilities by the off-taker were not based upon PURPA or a QF mandated rate but were instead adopted as a result of a competitive bidding process and approved as part of the off-taker\u2019s integrated resource planning process and in order for the off-taker to comply with Nevada\u2019s RPS. While those PPAS were initially required to file for QF or EWG status with the FERC, the PPAs and their related prices for the term of the PPA were not approved by the FERC pursuant to PURPA. The PURPA and QF risks described above also are not likely to affect our Nevada and California based projects that have their PPAs with the SCPPA because SCPPA is not a regulated public utility under PURPA.\nThe reduction or elimination of government incentives could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flows.\nConstruction and operation of our geothermal power plants and recovered energy-based power plants has benefited, and may benefit in the future, from public policies and government incentives that support renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of these projects in regions and countries where we operate. Such policies and incentives include PTCs (that are applicable for projects that started construction by the end of 2017) and ITCs, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, renewable portfolio standards, carbon trading mechanisms, rebates, and mandated feed-in-tariffs, and may include similar or other incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of geothermal, solar and other power products. Some of these measures have been implemented at the federal level, while others have been implemented by different states within the U.S. or countries outside the U.S. where we operate.\nThe availability and continuation of these public policies and government incentives have a significant effect on the economics and viability of our development program and continued construction of new geothermal, recovered energy-based, Solar PV power plants and, recently, energy storage projects. Any changes to such public policies, or any reduction in or elimination or expiration of such government incentives could affect us in different ways. For example, any reduction in, termination or expiration of renewable portfolio standards may result in less demand for generation from our geothermal and recovered energy-based, power plants. Any reductions in, termination or expiration of other government incentives could reduce the economic viability of, and cause us to reduce, the construction of new geothermal, recovered energy-based, Solar PV or any other power plants. Similarly, any such changes that affect the geothermal energy industry in a manner that is different from other sources of renewable energy, such as wind or solar, may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses engaged in the development, construction and operation of renewable power projects using such other resources. Any of the foregoing outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, future results, and cash flows.\nWe are a holding company and our cash depends substantially on the performance of our subsidiaries and the power plants they operate, most of which is subject to restrictions and taxation on dividends and distributions.\nWe are a holding company whose primary assets are our ownership of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. We conduct no other business and, as a result, we depend entirely upon our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and cash flow.\nThe agreements pursuant to which some of our subsidiaries have incurred debt restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us prior to the satisfaction of other obligations, including the payment of operating expenses, debt service and replenishment or maintenance of cash reserves. In the case of some of our power plants that are owned jointly with other partners, there may be certain additional restrictions on dividend distributions pursuant to our agreements with those partners. In all of the foreign countries where our existing power plants are located, dividend payments to us may also be subject to withholding taxes. Each of the events described above may reduce or eliminate the aggregate amount of cash we can receive from our subsidiaries.\nThe costs of compliance with environmental laws and of obtaining and maintaining environmental permits and governmental approvals required for construction and/or operation may increase in the future and these costs (as well as any fines or penalties that may be imposed upon us in the event of any non-compliance with such laws or regulations) could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nEnvironmental laws, ordinances and regulations affecting us can be subject to change and such change could result in increased compliance costs, the need for additional capital expenditures, or otherwise adversely affect us. In addition, our power plants are required to comply with numerous domestic and foreign, federal, regional, state and local statutory and regulatory environmental standards and to maintain numerous environmental permits and governmental approvals required for construction and/or operation. We may not be able to renew, maintain or obtain all environmental permits and governmental approvals required for the continued operation or further development of the power plants. We have not yet obtained certain permits and government approvals required for the completion and successful operation of power plants under construction or enhancement. Our failure to renew, maintain or obtain required permits or governmental approvals, including the permits and approvals necessary for operating power plants under construction or enhancement, could cause our operations to be limited or suspended. Finally, some of the environmental permits and governmental approvals that have been issued to the power plants contain conditions and restrictions, including restrictions or limits on emissions and discharges of pollutants and contaminants, or may have limited terms. If we fail to satisfy these conditions or comply with these restrictions, or with any statutory or regulatory environmental standards, we may become subject to regulatory enforcement action and the operation of the power plants could be adversely affected or be subject to fines, penalties or additional costs.\nWe could be exposed to significant liability for violations of hazardous substances laws because of the use or presence of such substances at our power plants.\nOur power plants are subject to numerous domestic and foreign federal, regional, state and local statutory and regulatory standards relating to the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances. We use butane, pentane, industrial lubricants, and other substances at our power plants which are or could become classified as hazardous substances. If any hazardous substances are found to have been released into the environment at or by the power plants in concentrations that exceed regulatory limits, we could become liable for the investigation and removal of those substances, regardless of their source and time of release. If we fail to comply with these laws, ordinances or regulations (or any change thereto), we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, the imposition of liens or fines, and large expenditures to bring the power plants into compliance. Furthermore, in the U.S., we can be held liable for the cleanup of releases of hazardous substances at other locations where we arranged for disposal of those substances, even if we did not cause the release at that location. The cost of any remediation activities in connection with a spill or other release of such substances could be significant.\nCurrent and future urbanizing activities and related residential, commercial, and industrial developments may encroach on or limit geothermal or Solar PV activities in the areas of our power plants, thereby affecting our ability to utilize access, inject and/or transport geothermal resources on or underneath the affected surface areas.\nCurrent and future urbanizing activities and related residential, commercial and industrial development may encroach on or limit geothermal activities in the areas of our power plants or construction and operation of Solar PV facilities, thereby affecting our ability to utilize, access, inject, and/or transport geothermal resources on or underneath the affected surface areas or build Solar PV facilities, which require large areas of relatively flat land. In particular, the Heber power plants rely on an area, which we refer to as the Heber Known Geothermal Resource Area, or Heber KGRA, for the geothermal resource necessary to generate electricity at the Heber power plants. Imperial County has adopted a \u201cspecific plan area\u201d that covers the Heber KGRA, which we refer to as the \u201cHeber Specific Plan Area\u201d. The Heber Specific Plan Area allows commercial, residential, industrial and other employment-oriented development in a mixed-use orientation, which currently includes geothermal uses. Several of the landowners from whom we hold geothermal leases have expressed an interest in developing their land for residential, commercial, industrial or other surface uses in accordance with the parameters of the Heber Specific Plan Area. Currently, Imperial County\u2019s Heber Specific Plan Area is coordinated with the cities of El Centro and Calexico. There has been ongoing underlying interest since the early 1990s to incorporate the community of Heber. While any incorporation process would likely take several years, if Heber were to be incorporated, the City of Heber could replace Imperial County as the governing land use authority, which, depending on its policies, could have a significant effect on land use and availability of geothermal resources.\nCurrent and future development proposals within Imperial County and the City of Calexico, applications for annexations to the City of Calexico, and plans to expand public infrastructure may affect surface areas within the Heber KGRA, thereby limiting our ability to utilize, access, inject and/or transport the geothermal resource on or underneath the affected surface area that is necessary for the operation of our Heber power plants, which could adversely affect our operations and reduce our revenues.\nCurrent construction works and urban developments in the vicinity of our Steamboat complex of power plants in Nevada may also affect future permitting for geothermal operations relating to those power plants. Such works and developments include plans for the construction of a new casino hotel and other commercial or industrial developments on land in the vicinity of our Steamboat complex.\nPossible application of the new base erosion and anti-abuse tax in the U.S. may adversely affect us.\nThe recently enacted Tax Act in the U.S. included BEAT, that could apply to us and, more importantly, could reduce the amount of tax equity that can be raised on geothermal projects on which PTCs will be claimed. The aim of the base erosion tax is to prevent multinational companies from reducing their U.S. taxes by \u201cstripping\u201d earnings across the U.S. border by making payments to foreign affiliates that can be deducted in the U.S. An example of such a payment is interest on an intercompany loan or a payment to a back office in a foreign country for equipment or services. The goal of the BEAT is to ensure that multinational companies do not use cross-border payments to reduce their U.S. taxes to less than 10 percent (5 percent for 2018) of an expanded definition of taxable income. BEAT requires an annual calculation. Generally, the tax only applies to certain corporations with at least $500 million in average annual gross receipts for the United States for the three prior taxable years before the calculation and with base erosion payments that account for at least 3 percent (2 percent for certain corporations) of their deductions for the taxable year. If the tax applies to us, our tax equity raised on geothermal projects on which PTCs can be claimed may be reduced, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nThe Israeli Tax Ruling we obtained in connection with our acquisition of Ormat Industries imposes conditions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions.\nThe Israeli Tax Ruling we obtained in connection with the acquisition of Ormat Industries imposes a number of conditions that limit our flexibility in operating our business and in engaging in certain corporate transactions. Until the end of 2018, we agreed to maintain (and, to the extent that our operations expand, likewise expand) the production activities we currently carry out in Israel. Under certain circumstances, these conditions may not allow us the flexibility that we need to operate our business and may prevent us from taking advantage of strategic opportunities that would benefit our business and our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Economic and Financial Conditions\nWe may be unable to obtain the financing we need to pursue our growth strategy and any future financing we receive may be less favorable to us than our current financing arrangements, either of which may adversely affect our ability to expand our operations.\nMost of our geothermal power plants generally have been financed using leveraged financing structures, consisting of non-recourse or limited recourse debt obligations. Each of our projects under development or construction and those projects and businesses we may seek to acquire, or construct will require substantial capital investment. Our continued access to capital on acceptable terms is necessary for the success of our growth strategy. Our attempts to obtain future financings may not be successful or on favorable terms.\nMarket conditions and other factors may not permit future project and acquisition financings on terms similar to those our subsidiaries have previously received. Our ability to arrange for financing on a substantially non-recourse or limited recourse basis, and the costs of such financing, are dependent on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, conditions in the global capital and credit markets, investor confidence, the continued success of current power plants, the credit quality of the power plants being financed, the political situation in the country where the power plant is located, and the continued existence of tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital. If we are not able to obtain financing for our power plants on a substantially non-recourse or limited recourse basis, we may have to finance them using recourse capital such as direct equity investments or the incurrence of additional debt by us.\nAlso, in the absence of favorable financing options, we may decide not to build new plants or acquire facilities from third parties. Any of these alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects.\nWe may also need additional financing to implement our strategic plan. For example, our cash flow from operations and existing liquidity facilities may not be adequate to finance any acquisitions we may want to pursue or new technologies we may want to develop or acquire. Financing for acquisitions or technology development activities may not be available on the non-recourse or limited recourse basis we have historically used for our business, or on other terms we find acceptable.\nOur foreign power plants and foreign manufacturing operations expose us to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates, which may reduce our profits from such power plants and operations.\nRisks attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when any of our foreign subsidiaries incur operating or other expenses in one type of currency but receive revenues in another. In such cases, an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce such subsidiary\u2019s ability to meet its debt service obligations, reduce the amount of cash and income we receive from such foreign subsidiary or increase such subsidiary\u2019s overall expenses. In addition, the imposition by foreign governments of restrictions on the transfer of foreign currency abroad, or restrictions on the conversion of local currency into foreign currency, would have an adverse effect on the operations of our foreign power plants and foreign manufacturing operations, and may limit or diminish the amount of cash and income that we receive from such foreign power plants and operations.\nA significant portion of our electricity revenues is attributed to payments made by power purchasers under PPAs. The failure of any such power purchaser to perform its obligations under the relevant PPA or the loss of a PPA due to a default would reduce our net income and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nA significant portion of our revenues is attributable to electricity our power plants sell to power purchasers under the relevant PPAs. There is a risk that any one or more of the power purchasers may not fulfill their respective payment obligations under their PPAs. If any of the power purchasers fails to meet its payment obligations under its PPA(s), such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nOur power plants have generally been financed through a combination of our corporate funds and limited or non-recourse project finance debt and lease financing. If our project subsidiaries default on their obligations under such limited or non-recourse debt or lease financing, we may be required to make certain payments to the relevant debt holders, and if the collateral supporting such leveraged financing structures is foreclosed upon, we may lose certain of our power plants.\nOur power plants have generally been financed using a combination of our corporate funds and limited or non-recourse project finance debt or lease financing. Limited recourse project finance debt refers to our additional agreement, as part of the financing of a power plant, to provide limited financial support for the power plant subsidiary in the form of limited guarantees, indemnities, capital contributions and agreements to pay certain debt service deficiencies. Non-recourse project finance debt or lease financing refers to financing arrangements that are repaid solely from the power plant\u2019s revenues and are secured by the power plant\u2019s physical assets, major contracts, cash accounts and, in many cases, our ownership interest in the project subsidiary. If our project subsidiaries default on their obligations under the relevant debt documents, creditors of a limited recourse project financing will have direct recourse to us, to the extent of our limited recourse obligations, which may require us to use distributions received by us from other power plants, as well as other sources of cash available to us, in order to satisfy such obligations. In addition, if our project subsidiaries default on their obligations under the relevant debt documents (or a default under such debt documents arises as a result of a cross-default to the debt documents of some of our other power plants) and the creditors foreclose on the relevant collateral, we may lose our ownership interest in the relevant project subsidiary or our project subsidiary owning the power plant would only retain an interest in the physical assets, if any, remaining after all debts and obligations were paid in full.\nPossible fluctuations in the cost of construction, raw materials, commodities and drilling may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results, and cash flow.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on the supply of various raw materials, including primarily steel and aluminum, commodities and industrial equipment components that we use. We currently obtain all such raw materials, commodities and equipment at prevailing market prices. We are not dependent on any one supplier and do not have any long-term agreements with any of our suppliers. Future cost increases of such raw materials, commodities and equipment, to the extent not otherwise passed along to our customers, could adversely affect our profit margins.\nRisks Related to Force Majeure\nThe existence of a prolonged force majeure event or a forced outage affecting a power plant, or the transmission systems could reduce our net income and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nThe operation of our subsidiaries\u2019 geothermal power plants is subject to a variety of risks discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, including events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes, landslides, floods, severe storms, volcanic eruptions, lava flow or other similar events. If a power plant experiences an occurrence resulting in a force majeure event, although our subsidiary that owns that power plant would be excused from its obligations under the relevant PPA the relevant power purchaser may not be required to make any capacity and/or energy payments with respect to the affected power plant for as long as the force majeure event continues and, pursuant to certain of our PPAs, will have the right to prematurely terminate the PPA. Additionally, to the extent that a forced outage has occurred, and if as a result the power plant fails to attain certain performance requirements under certain of our PPAs, the power purchaser may have the right to permanently reduce the contract capacity (and correspondingly, the amount of capacity payments due pursuant to such agreements in the future), seek refunds of certain past capacity payments, and/or prematurely terminate the PPA. As a consequence, we may not receive any net revenues from the affected power plant other than the proceeds from any business interruption insurance that applies to the force majeure event or forced outage after the relevant waiting period and may incur significant liabilities in respect of past amounts required to be refunded.\nThreats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from, cyber-attacks, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our business, or the businesses of third parties, may impact our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nWe are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber-attacks, including, among others, malware, viruses and attachments to e-mails, and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. Our generation and transmission facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities, systems and physical assets, including our Viridity business\u2019s VPowerTM software platform, could be directly or indirectly affected by such activities.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems (and any programs or data stored thereon or therein) are vulnerable to security breaches, failures, data leakage or unauthorized access due to such activities. Those breaches and events may result from acts of our employees, contractors or third parties. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nThe implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs. These types of events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow. In addition, such events could require significant management attention and resources and could adversely affect our reputation among customers and the public.\nA disruption of transmission or the transmission infrastructure facilities of third parties could negatively impact our business. Because generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected system, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system within our systems or within a neighboring system. Any such disruption could adversely affect our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.\nU.S. federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Act was signed into law, significantly reforming the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Act, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from the previous top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits, including the treatment of net operating losses.\nUnder the Tax Act, the deductibility of \u201cnet interest\u201d for a business is limited to 30% of adjusted taxable income. The new proposed regulations issued by Treasury applies regardless of whether the interest payment is made to a US or foreign person, whether the interest recipient is related, or whether the interest recipient is exempt from US tax. Further, any interest that cannot be deducted in a year can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has not early adopted these proposed regulations and intends to adopt during the 2019 tax year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have evaluated the impact and determined there is no limit on our interest deductibility for federal income tax purposes for the current period, but anticipates there could be significant limitations upon adoption.\nWe continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain, and our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow, as well as our stock price, could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nA substantial percentage of our common stock is held by stockholders whose interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nOn July 26, 2017, ORIX purchased approximately 22% of our shares of common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Governance Agreement between the Company and ORIX entered into in connection with this stock purchase transaction, ORIX has the right to designate three directors to our Board for as long as ORIX and its affiliates collectively hold at least 18% of the voting power of all of the outstanding voting securities of the Company as well as the right to representation on certain committees of our Board. ORIX may also exercise certain registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement between the Company and ORIX.\nAs a result of these rights and ORIX\u2019s beneficial ownership of our common stock, ORIX could exert influence through its Board representation on the business, operations and management of the Company and its subsidiaries, including our strategic plans, or, as a significant stockholder, on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, or other purchases of our common stock that might otherwise give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for our shares. If ORIX exercises its registration rights to require the Company to register for sale the common stock held by ORIX or ORIX otherwise sells its common stock in the public markets, the price of our common stock may decline. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, and your investment may decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations including as a result of seasonal variations in our Electricity segment-based revenues or variations from year-to-year in our Product segment-based revenues;\n\u25cf\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of market analysts;\n\u25cf\nconditions and trends in the end markets we serve, and changes in the estimation of the size and growth rate of these markets;\n\u25cf\nour ability to integrate acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of significant contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nrestatements of historical financial results and changes in financial forecasts;\n\u25cf\nloss of one or more of our significant customers;\n\u25cf\nlegislation;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nthe trading of our common stock on multiple trading markets, which takes place in different currencies and at different times; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NYSE and the market for energy companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, such as the recent class action filed on June 2018 by Mac Costas and discussed elsewhere in this report, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, future results and cash flow.", "PERMNO": 90444, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "ORA"}
