RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following information about risks and uncertainties that may affect us or our business, together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following events, described as risks, actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities. An investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should not invest in our securities if you cannot bear the economic risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time and cannot afford to lose your entire investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe are substantially dependent upon the approval and success of SUSTOL\u00ae (granisetron) Injection, extended release.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to develop and commercialize our most advanced product candidate, which we intend to market as SUSTOL, subject to regulatory approval. We have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of SUSTOL, which is being developed for the prevention of both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (\u201cCINV\u201d) associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (\u201cMEC\u201d) or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (\u201cHEC\u201d). In May 2015, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 3 MAGIC study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of SUSTOL for the prevention of delayed CINV associated with HEC regimens. SUSTOL, when administered as part of a three-drug regimen with NK1 receptor antagonist fosaprepitant and corticosteroid dexamethasone, demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in the prevention of delayed CINV compared to the currently recommended, standard-of-care, three-drug regimen. Results from the MAGIC study were included in our New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) for SUSTOL, which we resubmitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) on July 17, 2015. The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (\u201cPDUFA\u201d) goal date of January 17, 2016. In January 2016, we were notified by the FDA that it would not take action on our SUSTOL NDA by the PDUFA date and that the FDA anticipates taking action in late February 2016.\nOur ability to generate revenue in the next one to two years and our future success, in large part, depends on the approval, scope of the approved product label and successful commercialization of SUSTOL. We will not be able to commercialize SUSTOL until we obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. In September 2012, we resubmitted the NDA seeking approval for SUSTOL with the FDA. In March 2013, we received a Complete Response Letter (\u201cCRL\u201d) from the FDA pertaining to our resubmission of our NDA for SUSTOL. In the CRL, the FDA identified several remaining issues that need to be addressed prior to approval of our NDA for SUSTOL, including issues relating to: manufacturing of SUSTOL, the administration of SUSTOL and our analysis of efficacy data for SUSTOL under more recent guidelines classifying chemotherapy regimens. We believe we have addressed the issues, although there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree. The FDA\u2019s review of our resubmission may not produce positive decisions as to whether:\n\u2022 SUSTOL is safe and effective in its proposed use(s) and whether its benefits outweigh the risks;\n\u2022 the labeling for SUSTOL can include our desired product indications covering acute and delayed CINV, for use in both HEC and MEC regimens; and\n\u2022 the methods used in manufacturing SUSTOL and the controls used to maintain its quality are adequate to preserve chain of identity, strength, quality and purity.\nDelays in obtaining regulatory approval for SUSTOL, or the issuance of another CRL by the FDA, would, among other consequences, delay the launch of SUSTOL and impact our ability to raise additional capital, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf SUSTOL is approved, but does not attain market acceptance by healthcare professionals and patients, our business and results of operations will suffer.\nEven if SUSTOL receives regulatory approval for commercial sale by the FDA, the revenue that we may receive from the sale of SUSTOL may be less than expected and will depend on many factors that are outside of our control. Factors that may affect revenue from SUSTOL, if approved, include:\n\u2022 the scope of our approved product label;\n\u2022 the perception of physicians and other members of the health care community of the safety and efficacy and cost-competitiveness relative to that of competing products;\n\u2022 the cost-effectiveness of our product;\n\u2022 acceptance by institutional formulary committees;\n\u2022 patient and physician satisfaction with our product;\n\u2022 our ability to have SUSTOL manufactured at a commercial production level successfully and on a timely basis;\n\u2022 the cost and availability of raw materials;\n\u2022 the size of the potential market for our product;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement from government and third-party payors;\n\u2022 unfavorable publicity concerning our product or similar products;\n\u2022 the introduction, availability and acceptance of competing treatments;\n\u2022 adverse event information relating to our product or similar classes of drugs;\n\u2022 product liability litigation alleging injuries relating to the product or similar classes of drugs;\n\u2022 product labeling or product insert language required by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u2022 our ability to access third parties to manufacture and distribute our product on acceptable terms;\n\u2022 regulatory developments related to the manufacture or continued use of our product;\n\u2022 any post-approval study requirements and the results thereof;\n\u2022 the extent and effectiveness of sales and marketing and distribution support for our product;\n\u2022 our competitors\u2019 activities, including decisions as to the timing of competing product launches, pricing and discounting; and\n\u2022 any other material adverse developments with respect to the potential commercialization of our product.\nOur revenue will be adversely affected if, due to these or other factors, our commercialization of SUSTOL does not achieve the acceptance and demand to sustain product revenue growth. If we are unable to successfully commercialize SUSTOL, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nWe have yet to receive regulatory approval for a product utilizing our proprietary drug delivery technology.\nOur proprietary Biochronomer\u00ae drug delivery technology has not yet been proven through commercial approval, and successful launch, of a product utilizing this technology. We may not be able to substantiate the commercial viability of our drug delivery technology for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022 the failure to receive regulatory approval of a drug utilizing the delivery technology;\n\u2022 the inability to show consistent results in the quality or quantity of product manufactured utilizing this delivery technology; and\n\u2022 the inability to manufacture drugs using this delivery platform at a cost effective price.\nIn the event we are unable to demonstrate commercial success and viability of products utilizing this delivery technology, our prospects for success and growth would be significantly harmed.\nOur product platforms or product development efforts may not produce safe, efficacious or commercially viable products and, if we are unable to develop new products, our business may suffer.\nOur long-term viability and growth will depend upon the successful development of products from our research and development activities. Product development is very expensive and involves a high degree of risk. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. Success in preclinical work or early-stage clinical trials does not ensure that later-stage or larger-scale clinical trials will be successful. Our ability to complete our clinical trials in a timely fashion depends in large part on a number of key factors including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, the rate of patient enrollment in clinical trials and compliance with extensive current good clinical practices (\u201ccGCP\u201d) requirements.\nIn addition, because we fund the development of our product candidates, we may not be able to continue to fund all such development efforts to completion or to provide the support necessary to perform the clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals,\nor market any approved products. If our delivery technologies or product development efforts fail to result in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates or if new products do not perform as anticipated, such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to do our preclinical testing and conduct our clinical trials, and their failure to perform their obligations in a timely and competent manner may delay development and commercialization of our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have used contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to oversee our clinical trials for SUSTOL, HTX-011 and our other product candidates, and we expect to use the same or similar organizations for our future clinical trials and pipeline programs. There can be no assurance that these CROs will perform their obligations at all times in a competent or timely fashion, and we must rigorously oversee their activities in order to be confident in their conduction of these trials on our behalf. If the CROs fail to commit resources to our product candidates, our clinical programs related to our product candidates could be delayed, terminated or unsuccessful, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize them. Different cultural and operational issues in foreign countries could cause delays or unexpected problems with patient enrollment or with the data obtained from those locations. If we experience significant delays in the progress of our clinical trials or experience doubts with respect to the quality of data derived from our clinical trials, we could face significant delays in gaining necessary product approvals.\nWe also rely on third parties to assist in conducting our preclinical studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices, and the Animal Welfare Act requirements. We, our CROs, and other third parties are required to comply with cGCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in the clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our ongoing or future clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, any of our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under GCP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs and other third parties we may engage to support our development programs, are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner, or may fail to perform at all. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the preclinical results or clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to test requirements, our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nIf our suppliers and contract manufacturers fail to manufacture SUSTOL in a timely manner or fail to comply with stringent regulatory requirements, we will face delays in our ability to obtain regulatory approval for SUSTOL.\nWe are dependent on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates as well as on third parties for our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any of these third parties, the approval or manufacturing of SUSTOL or any of our product candidates could be delayed, which could harm our results of operations. To date, we have relied on third parties to manufacture and perform important pre-commercialization manufacturing activities for SUSTOL. As part of the process for obtaining regulatory approval, we must demonstrate that the facilities, equipment and processes used to manufacture SUSTOL are capable of consistently producing a product that meets all applicable quality criteria, and that is comparable to the product that was used in our clinical trials. We must also provide the FDA with information regarding the validation of the manufacturing facilities, equipment and processes of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers, and data supporting the stability of SUSTOL. If our third-party suppliers and manufacturers are not in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements, the approval by regulatory authorities for us to begin marketing a product may be delayed, existing product batches may be compromised, and we may experience delays in the availability of SUSTOL for commercial distribution.\nFor example, our most recent CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA resubmission for SUSTOL stated that the NDA could not be approved due to, among other issues, deficiencies observed during an inspection of the facilities used by our third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce SUSTOL. If the FDA is not satisfied with our response and corrective actions taken by these third parties, we may be required to complete additional manufacturing development activities or provide other information to the FDA, which could cause substantial delays in obtaining regulatory approval for SUSTOL, increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf our suppliers and contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture in commercially viable quantities, we could face delays in our ability to commercialize SUSTOL, and our costs will increase.\nTo date, SUSTOL has been manufactured primarily in small quantities for clinical trials. If in the future, SUSTOL or any of our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we will need to be able to consistently manufacture our products in larger quantities, and be able to show equivalency for the FDA in the manufacture of product at commercial scale as compared to development batch size. The commercial success of our products will be dependent upon the ability of our contract manufacturers to produce a product in commercial quantities at competitive costs of manufacture in a process that is validated by the FDA. If SUSTOL receives regulatory approval, we plan to scale-up manufacturing for SUSTOL in order to realize important economies of scale. These scale-up activities take time to implement, require additional capital investment, process development and validation studies, and regulatory approval. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in achieving competitive manufacturing costs through such scale-up activities.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products is a highly complex process in which a variety of difficulties may arise from time to time, including product loss due to material failure, equipment failure, vendor error, operator error, labor shortages, inability to obtain material, equipment or transportation, physical or electronic security breaches and natural disasters. Problems with manufacturing processes could result in product defects or manufacturing failures, which could require us to delay shipment of products or recall products previously shipped, or could impair our ability to expand into new markets or supply products in existing markets. We may not be able to resolve any such problems in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe expect to depend on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers for manufacturing SUSTOL, as well as any future products that we develop; if our contract manufacturers do not perform as expected, our business could suffer.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of any product, including SUSTOL. Our ability to progress and commercialize SUSTOL, as well as any other products or product candidates that we may develop will depend in part on our ability to arrange for other parties to manufacture our products at a competitive cost, in accordance with regulatory requirements, and in sufficient quantities for clinical testing and eventual commercialization, if approved. We currently rely on a small number of third-party manufacturers to produce compounds used in our product development activities and expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our potential products and for all of our commercial needs. Certain contract manufacturers are, at the present time (and are expected to be for the foreseeable future), our sole resource to manufacture certain key components of SUSTOL, as well as key components for product candidates in clinical and preclinical testing in our research and development program. Although we entered into a single-source, long-term commercial manufacturing agreement for the manufacture of SUSTOL and have a long-term agreement for the manufacture of our bioerodible polymer, we may not be able to successfully negotiate long-term agreements with any additional third parties and thereby reduce or remove our dependence on a single supplier. We may have difficulties with these manufacturer relationships, and we may not be able to find replacement contract manufacturers on satisfactory terms or on a timely basis. Also, due to regulatory and technical requirements, we may have limited ability to shift production to a different third party should the need arise. We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement on reasonable terms, if at all, with such a manufacturer. Even if we were to reach agreement, the transition of the manufacturing process to a different third party could take a significant amount of time and money, and may not be successful.\nFurther, we, along with our contract manufacturers, are required to comply with FDA requirements related to product testing, quality assurance, manufacturing and documentation. Our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable FDA regulatory requirements. They may be required to pass an FDA preapproval inspection for conformity with cGMPs before we can obtain approval to manufacture our products and will be subject to ongoing, periodic, unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. If we and our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with cGMP regulations, or fail to scale up manufacturing processes in a timely manner, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in defective products that could be harmful to patients, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our products, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Not complying with FDA requirements could result in an enforcement action, such as product recall, or prevent commercialization of our product candidates and delay our business development activities. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning or untitled letter or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, and potentially civil and/or criminal penalties depending on the matter.\nSUSTOL, HTX-011, HTX-019 or any of our other product candidates may be in competition with other products for access to the facilities of third parties. Consequently, SUSTOL, HTX-011, HTX-019 or any of our other product candidates may be subject to manufacturing delays if our contractors give other companies\u2019 products greater priority than our products. For this and\nother reasons, our third-party contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture SUSTOL, HTX-011, HTX-019 or any of our other product candidates in a cost-effective or timely manner. If not manufactured in a timely manner, the clinical development of any of our product candidates or their submission for regulatory approval could be delayed, and our ability to deliver products to market on a timely basis could be impaired. This could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation.\nCertain of the components used in the manufacture of SUSTOL, HTX-011, HTX-019 and our other product candidates are sourced from a single vendor.\nSome of the critical materials and components used in manufacturing SUSTOL, HTX-011, HTX-019 and our other product candidates are sourced from single suppliers. An interruption in the supply of a key material could significantly delay commercialization of SUSTOL, if approved, our research and development process or increase our expenses for commercialization or development products. Specialized materials must often be manufactured for the first time for use in drug delivery technologies, or materials may be used in the technologies in a manner different from their customary commercial uses. The quality of materials can be critical to the performance of a drug delivery technology, so a reliable source of a consistent supply of materials is important. Materials or components needed for our drug delivery technologies may be difficult to obtain on commercially reasonable terms, particularly when relatively small quantities are required or if the materials traditionally have not been used in pharmaceutical products.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market any products we may develop, we may be unable to generate product revenue.\nWe are currently in the initial stages of developing an internal sales organization for the sale, marketing and distribution of SUSTOL, or for any other products we may develop. In order to successfully commercialize SUSTOL or any other product, we must build our sales, marketing, distribution and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. The establishment and development of a sales organization to market SUSTOL and our other product candidates will be expensive and time consuming and could delay product launch, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop this capacity. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain skilled employees, we may not be able to achieve our objectives.\nWe depend on a small number of key management and technical personnel. Retaining our current employees and recruiting qualified personnel to perform future research and development and commercialization work will be critical to our success. Competition is always present for highly skilled and experienced personnel, and an inability to recruit or retain sufficient skilled personnel could result in delays in our business growth and development and adversely impact our research and development or commercial activities. If we lose key members of our senior management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements and our business may be harmed as a result.\nOur business strategy may include acquisitions of other businesses, products or product licenses. We may not be able to successfully manage such activities.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could cause us to incur contingent liabilities, commitments, or significant expense. In the course of pursuing strategic opportunities, we may evaluate potential acquisitions or investments in strategic technologies, products, or businesses. Future acquisitions or investments could subject us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 our inability to appropriately evaluate and take into consideration the potential uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including but not limited to the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 difficulties associated with realizing the perceived potential for commercial success with respect to any acquired technology, product, or business;\n\u2022 our ability to effectively integrate any new technology, product, and/or business including personnel, intellectual property or business relationships into our company;\n\u2022 our inability to generate revenues from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs and/or assumption of liabilities; and\n\u2022 the distraction of our management from our existing product development programs and initiatives in pursuing an acquisition.\nIn connection with an acquisition, we must estimate the value of the transaction by making certain assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. Any strategic transaction we may pursue may not result in the benefits we initially anticipate, and/or result in costs that end up outweighing the benefits, and may adversely impact our financial condition and be detrimental to our future business prospects.\nOur business strategy may include entry into collaborative agreements. We may not be able to enter into collaborative agreements or may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for these agreements.\nOur current business strategy may include the entry into collaborative agreements for the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates. The negotiation and consummation of these types of agreements typically involve simultaneous discussions with multiple potential collaborators and require significant time and resources from our officers, business development and research and development staff. In addition, in attracting the attention of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company collaborators, we compete with numerous other third parties with product opportunities as well as the collaborators\u2019 own internal product opportunities. We may not be able to consummate collaborative agreements, or we may not be able to negotiate commercially acceptable terms for these agreements.\nIf we do enter into such arrangements, we could be dependent upon the subsequent success of these other parties in performing their respective responsibilities and the cooperation of our partners. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019\nresources that will be devoted to our research activities related to our collaborative agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us.\nUnder agreements with any collaborators we may work with in the future, we may rely significantly on them to, among other activities:\n\u2022 fund research and development activities with us;\n\u2022 pay us fees upon the achievement of milestones; and\n\u2022 market for or with us for any commercial products that result from our collaborations.\nIf we do not consummate collaborative agreements, we may use our financial resources more rapidly on our product development efforts, continue to defer certain development activities or forego the exploitation of certain geographic territories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. Further, we may not be successful in overseeing any such collaborative arrangements. If we fail to establish and maintain necessary collaborative relationships, our business prospects could suffer.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of losses, we expect to generate losses in the near future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations and had an accumulated deficit of $412.8 million through December 31, 2015. Even if SUSTOL is approved, we expect to continue to generate substantial losses over at least the next several years as we:\n\u2022 continue to build a sales and marketing organization and commence commercialization of SUSTOL, if approved;\n\u2022 expand product development activities with respect to our product candidates;\n\u2022 conduct preclinical development and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u2022 pursue regulatory approvals for any current or future product candidates; and\n\u2022 engage in commercialization efforts for any future approved product candidates.\nIn addition, the amount we spend will impact our profitability. Our spending will depend, in part, on:\n\u2022 the number of product candidates we pursue;\n\u2022 the progress of our research and development programs for our product candidates, including clinical trials;\n\u2022 the time and expense that will be required to pursue FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory approvals for our product candidates, whether such approvals are obtained and the scope of any approved product label;\n\u2022 the cost of possible acquisitions of technologies, compounds, product rights or companies;\n\u2022 the cost of obtaining licenses to use technology owned by others for proprietary products and otherwise;\n\u2022 the time and expense required to prosecute, enforce and/or challenge patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 the costs of potential litigation; and\n\u2022 the costs associated with recruiting and compensating a highly skilled workforce in an environment where competition for such employees may be intense.\nTo achieve and sustain profitability, we must, alone or in cooperation with others, successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, market and sell our products. If SUSTOL is approved for commercialization, we must successfully launch and commercialize the product. If SUSTOL is not approved, we will likely experience significant delays before we begin to recognize meaningful levels of revenue, if ever. We will incur substantial expenses in our efforts to develop and commercialize our products and we may never generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability.\nAdditional capital may be needed in the future to enable us to implement our business plan, and we may be unable to raise capital, which would force us to limit or cease our operations and related product development programs.\nIn June 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,520,000 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $128.2 million, and as of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $131.2 million. We believe that our current working capital is sufficient to fund operations through 2016, including pursuing regulatory approval for SUSTOL in the U.S. and, if approved, making significant investments to support commercialization, and completing Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies currently ongoing and expected to commence in 2016 relative to our HTX-011 and HTX-019 product candidates. In the event that we pursue preclinical and/or clinical development in other areas, potentially acquire other strategic assets, if SUSTOL is not approved or if the degree of commercial success of SUSTOL is less than expected, we may need to raise additional capital, and we may seek funds through various sources, including debt and equity offerings, corporate collaborations, bank borrowings, arrangements relating to assets, sale of royalty streams we may receive on our products or other financing methods or structures. The source, timing and availability of any financings will depend on market conditions, development program progress, interest rates and other factors. If we are unable to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or otherwise, we may be required to reduce or defer our activities. Our capital requirements going forward will depend on numerous factors, including but not limited to: the scope, rate of progress, results and costs of preclinical testing and clinical trials; an approval decision by the FDA with respect to SUSTOL; the timing of and costs associated with the commercial launch of SUSTOL, if approved; the degree of commercial success of SUSTOL; the number and characteristics of product development programs we pursue and the pace of each program, including the timing of clinical trials; the time, cost and outcome involved in seeking other regulatory approvals; scientific progress in our research and development programs; the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs; our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations or partnerships for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates; the cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities if we commercialize products independently; the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop; and general market conditions.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital when needed or desired, or we may need to raise additional capital on unfavorable terms, which could result in dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe may not be able to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds, we may be required to curtail significantly or cease our operations.\nThe timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the status of regulatory approval of any pending applications with the FDA, or other regulator, as the case may be, and the costs involved with pursuing regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 the number and characteristics of product development programs we pursue and the pace of each program;\n\u2022 the scope, rate of progress, results and costs of preclinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations or partnerships for research, development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the cost and timing of establishing sales and marketing capabilities if we commercialize any products independently; and\n\u2022 the cost of establishing supply arrangements for clinical and commercial development of our product candidates and any products that we may develop.\nIf we issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities to raise funds, our stockholders will suffer dilution of their investment, and such issuance may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include, among other things, limitations on borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make investments. Our Senior Secured Convertible Notes (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) also include restrictions on our use of cash and financial activities. In the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners, these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products on terms that are not favorable to us or require us to enter into a collaboration arrangement that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our product development programs and reduce personnel-related and other costs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProvisions contained in our Convertible Notes limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nThe Convertible Notes are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our bank and investment accounts, and the terms of the Convertible Notes require us to seek approval from the holders of the Convertible Notes before taking certain actions, including incurring additional indebtedness or modifying the terms of existing indebtedness. The Convertible Notes also include events of default which include any default of our financial obligations under certain material contracts we may enter into. In addition, potential third-party lenders may be unwilling to subordinate new debt to the Convertible Notes. As a\nresult, we may not be able to raise funds through the issuance of debt in the future, which could impair our ability to finance our business obligations or pursue business expansion initiatives.\nWe could be exposed to significant product liability claims that could be time consuming and costly to defend, divert management attention and adversely impact our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage.\nThe administration of drugs in humans, whether in clinical studies or commercially, carries the inherent risk of product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually the cause of an injury. Our product candidates and products that we may commercially market in the future may cause, or may appear to have caused, injury or dangerous drug interactions, and we may not learn about or understand those effects until the product or product candidate has been administered to patients for a prolonged period of time.\nAlthough we are insured against such risks up to an annual aggregate limit in connection with clinical trials and commercial sales of our products, our present product liability insurance may be inadequate and may not fully cover the costs of any claim or any ultimate damages we might be required to pay. Product liability claims or other claims related to our products, regardless of their outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages. Any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms. In addition, product liability coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. A product liability claim could also significantly harm our reputation and delay market acceptance of our products.\nThe investment of our cash is subject to risks, which may cause losses or adversely affect the liquidity of these investments and our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur investments of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which have been and may, in the future, be exacerbated by a U.S. and/or global financial crisis. We may realize losses in the fair value of certain of our investments or a complete loss of these investments if the credit markets tighten, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Industry\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nConducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. For example, we have incurred significant expenses in developing SUSTOL and, even if approved and depending on the scope of the approved product label, it may not result in a commercially viable product. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we, or our potential partners, must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses in humans. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expense and devote a significant amount of time to preclinical testing and clinical trials.\nThe outcome of clinical testing is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later stage clinical trials. In addition, regulations are not static, and regulatory agencies, including the FDA, alter their staff, interpretations and practices and may impose more stringent requirements than currently in effect, which may adversely affect our planned drug development and/or our commercialization efforts. Satisfying FDA, and other regulatory agencies\u2019, requirements typically takes a significant number of years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by any delays in, or termination of, our clinical trials. Factors that could impede our ability to generate commercially viable products through the conduct of clinical trials include:\n\u2022 insufficient funds to conduct clinical trials;\n\u2022 the inability to find partners, if necessary, for support including research, development, manufacturing or clinical needs;\n\u2022 the failure of tests or studies necessary to submit an NDA, such as bioequivalence studies in support of a 505(b)(2) regulatory filing, or stability studies, to meet the required standards;\n\u2022 the failure of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 the failure by us or third-party investigators, CROs, or other third parties involved in the research to adhere to regulatory requirements applicable to the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u2022 the failure of preclinical testing and early clinical trials to predict results of later clinical trials;\n\u2022 any delay in completion of clinical trials, resulting in increased costs; and\n\u2022 the inability to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates following completion of clinical trials, or delays in obtaining such approvals.\nThere can be no assurance that if our clinical trials are successfully initiated and completed we will be able to obtain approval by the FDA in the U.S. or similar regulatory authorities elsewhere in the world in a timely manner, if at all. If we fail to successfully develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to attain profitability, and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be damaged, each of which would cause our stock price to decrease.\nDelays in clinical testing could increase our costs and delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates.\nBefore we can receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our potential products, the FDA and comparable authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions require extensive preclinical safety testing and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy. Significant delays in preclinical and clinical testing could materially impact our product development costs and delay\nregulatory approval of our product candidates. Our ability to complete clinical trials in a timely manner could be impacted by, among other factors:\n\u2022 delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n\u2022 delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical study;\n\u2022 delay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022 delay or failure in obtaining institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign entities, to conduct a clinical trial at each site;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 delay or failure in obtaining clinical materials;\n\u2022 delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u2022 delay or failure in having subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022 clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022 inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication;\n\u2022 failure of our third-party clinical trial managers to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022 delay or failure in adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022 ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;\n\u2022 feedback from the FDA, the IRB, data safety monitoring boards, or comparable foreign entities, or results from earlier stage or concurrent preclinical and clinical studies, that might require modification to the protocol;\n\u2022 decision by the FDA, the IRB, comparable foreign regulatory entities, or recommendation by a data safety monitoring board or comparable foreign regulatory entity, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u2022 unacceptable risk-benefit profile or unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug;\n\u2022 manufacturing issues, including problems with manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials; and\n\u2022 changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, the ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, whether enrolled subjects drop out before completion, competing clinical trials, and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and while we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.\nOur failure to successfully establish, recruit for, and oversee our clinical trials could delay our product development effects and negatively impact our business. If we experience delays in the completion of any ongoing study, the commercial prospects of HTX-011, HTX-019 or any of our other product candidates could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidates\u2019 development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nWe may not obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Regulatory approval may also be delayed or revoked or may impose limitations on the indicated uses of a proposed product. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for SUSTOL or any of our other product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe process for obtaining approval of a new drug is time consuming, subject to unanticipated delays and costs, and requires the commitment of substantial resources. The regulatory process is uncertain, can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any product that we or our potential future collaborative partners develop must receive all necessary regulatory agency approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in the U.S. or other countries. Human pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements by the FDA in the U.S. and similar health authorities in foreign countries. We may not receive necessary regulatory approvals or clearances to market SUSTOL or any other product candidate in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions, as a result of changes in regulatory policies prior to approval or other events. Additionally, data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities, or from stability or bioequivalence studies, are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory agency approvals or clearances.\nSUSTOL or any of our other product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u2022 disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate that the product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022 failure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022 the failure of third-parties to manage and conduct the trials or perform necessary oversight to meet expected deadlines or to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate that the product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022 disagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022 the insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials to support the submission and filing of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022 disapproval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022 changes in approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe FDA or a comparable non-U.S. regulatory authority may require additional preclinical or clinical data to support approval, such as confirmatory studies and other data or studies to address questions or concerns that may arise during the FDA review process.\nEven if granted, regulatory approvals may include significant limitations on the uses for which products may be marketed. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in warning letters, imposition of civil penalties or other monetary payments, delay in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval, product recall or seizure, operating restrictions, interruption of clinical trials or manufacturing, injunctions and criminal prosecution.\nIn addition, the marketing and manufacturing of products are subject to continuing FDA review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, its manufacture or its marketing may result in the FDA requiring further clinical research or restrictions on the product or the manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent SUSTOL or any of our other product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn the event we pursue the right to market and sell SUSTOL or any other product candidates in jurisdictions other than the U.S., we would be required to obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements in each foreign country. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the U.S. generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that\ncountry. In the event we choose to pursue them, we may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. If we are unable in the future to obtain approval of a product candidate by regulatory authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nEven if SUSTOL or any of our other product candidates receives regulatory approval, it may still face future development and regulatory difficulties. If we fail to comply with continuing federal, state and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market drugs, and our business would be seriously harmed.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for SUSTOL or any of our other product candidates, it would be subject to ongoing requirements of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including requirements related to manufacturing, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, and reporting of safety and other post-market information. Following initial regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop, including SUSTOL, we will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including review of adverse drug experiences and clinical results that may be reported after drug products become commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or continued actions required as a condition of approval. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our drug candidates will also be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. If a previously unknown problem or problems with a product or a manufacturing and laboratory facility used by us is discovered, the FDA or foreign regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or on the manufacturing facility, including requiring us to withdraw the product from the market. Any changes to an approved product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often require FDA approval before the product, as modified, can be marketed. We and our contract manufacturers will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for submission of safety and other post-market information. If we and our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022 issue warning letters;\n\u2022 impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022 suspend or withdraw our regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend or terminate any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on our operations;\n\u2022 close the facilities of our contract manufacturers; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nAdditionally, such regulatory review covers a company\u2019s activities in the promotion of its drugs, with significant potential penalties and restrictions for promotion of drugs for an unapproved use or other inappropriate sales and marketing activities. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the U.S. will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General. Violations of applicable advertising and promotion laws and regulations, including promotion of products for unapproved (or off-label) uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil and criminal sanctions by the FDA. We are also required to submit information on our open and completed clinical trials to public registries and databases; failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to negative publicity, fines and penalties that could harm our business. If SUSTOL is approved, we will also be required to comply with the requirements to submit to governmental authorities information on payments to physicians and certain other third parties; failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to negative publicity, fines and penalties that could harm our business.\nThe commercial use of our products may cause unintended side effects or adverse reactions, or incidents of misuse may occur, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot predict whether any commercial use of our product candidates, if approved, will produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in clinical trials conducted for such product candidates to date. Additionally, incidents of product misuse may occur. These events, including the reporting of adverse safety events, among others, could result in product recalls, product liability actions or withdrawals or additional regulatory controls (including additional regulatory scrutiny and requirements for additional labeling), all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition from other companies developing products in the CINV indication, including those with potentially competitive delivery technologies.\nSUSTOL, if approved, will face significant competition upon commercial launch. In particular, competition may come from ALOXI, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and AKYNZEO\u00ae, an oral formulation of palonosetron combined with the NK1 receptor antagonist netupitant, both manufactured by Eisai; ProStrakan\u2019s SANCUSO\u00ae (granisetron transdermal patch), as well as generic forms of granisetron (formerly marketed as KYTRIL) and ondansetron (formerly marketed as ZOFRAN). If we are able to successfully develop HTX-019 for the treatment of CINV, we will compete with other NK1 receptor antagonists, such as Merck\u2019s EMEND\u00ae for Injection (fosaprepitant) and Tesaro\u2019s VARUBI\u2122 (rolapitant).\nWith respect to our pain management program, if we are able to successfully develop HTX-011 for the treatment of post-operative pain, we will compete with marketed products such as Pacira Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u2019s EXPAREL\u00ae (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension).\nSmaller or early stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical companies. We will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient\nregistration for clinical trials, and acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business. If any of our competitors succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do or for products that are more effective or less costly than ours, our commercial opportunity could be significantly reduced. Major technological changes can happen quickly in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the development of technologically improved or different products or drug delivery technologies may make our product candidates or platform technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nOur products may face competition from lower cost generic products offered by our competitors.\nPricing for therapeutics can be extremely competitive, and strict formulary guidelines enforced by payors may create significant challenges in the acceptance and profitability of branded products. The market for generic products can be very lucrative, and it is dominated by companies that may have much larger distribution capabilities than we may have in the future. It can be very difficult to predict the timing of the launch of generic products given the commonality of litigation with manufacturers over anticipated patent expiration. Our inability to accurately foresee and plan for generic product launches that may compete with our products may significantly impact our potential revenues from such products. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a branded product, or upon the \u201cat-risk\u201d launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a manufacturer of a generic version of a drug that may compete with one of our products, we could quickly lose a significant portion of our sales of that product. The inability for a branded product we may sell to successfully compete against generic products could negatively impact sales of our product, reduce our ability to grow our business, and significantly harm our business prospects.\nIf we cannot establish pricing of our product candidates acceptable to the U.S. or foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors, or arrange for favorable reimbursement policies, our product sales will be severely hindered.\nThe continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect our ability to generate adequate revenues and gross margins to make the products we develop commercially viable. Our ability to commercialize any product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations establish appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of such products and related treatments and for what uses reimbursement will be provided.\nIn the U.S., given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, reducing the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and reforming the Medicare and Medicaid systems. For example, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) encourages comparative effectiveness research. Any adverse findings for our products from such research may negatively impact reimbursement available for our products. Economic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs. State Medicaid programs are increasingly asking manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Further, the trend toward managed health care in the U.S., which could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products, may result in lower prices for our products, if they are approved for marketing. While we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals affecting our business will\nbe adopted, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material and adverse effect on our potential revenues and gross margins.\nIf we cannot arrange for adequate third-party reimbursement for our products, our future revenue will suffer.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our potential products, including SUSTOL, will depend in substantial part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors often challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and such pressure may increase in the future. Significant uncertainty exists as to the adequate reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. Any products we are able to successfully develop may not be reimbursable by third-party payors. In addition, our products may not be considered cost-effective and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a profit. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our products are approved for marketing and any such changes could further limit reimbursement. Reimbursement policies utilized by our collaborators or ourselves may be challenged by regulatory entities, with resultant fines, negative publicity and the need to implement changes that reduce the utilization of our products. If any products we develop do not receive adequate reimbursement, our revenue could be severely limited.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight pursuant to anti-kickback laws, false claims statutes, and anti-corruption laws, which may result in significant additional expense and limit our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, any failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nIn the U.S., upon commercial launch of a product, we will be subject to health care fraud and abuse regulations that are enforced by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product with marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products with marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 the Federal health care programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022 federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs that are false or fraudulent. This false claims liability may attach in the event that a company is found to have knowingly submitted false average sales price, best price or other pricing data to the government or to have unlawfully promoted its products;\n\u2022 federal \u201csunshine\u201d laws, now known as Open Payments, that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers, such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201cpayment or transfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals; and\n\u2022 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.\nThe risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened many of these laws. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes.\nIn addition, a number of states have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to track and report payments, gifts and other benefits provided to physicians and other health care professionals and entities. Similarly, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within PPACA requires pharmaceutical companies to report to the federal government certain payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act provisions required manufacturers that participate in federal health care programs to begin collecting such information after a six-month period following commercial launch of a product; however state law equivalents may require compliance beginning at commercial launch.\nIn addition, we may in the future be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.\nChanges in laws affecting the healthcare industry could also adversely affect our revenues and profitability, including new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to patent protection and enforcement, healthcare availability, and product pricing and marketing. Changes in FDA regulations and regulations issued by other regulatory agencies inside and outside of the U.S., including new or different approval requirements, timelines and processes, may also delay or prevent the approval of product candidates, require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or other measures that could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect the market for our products. The enactment in the U.S. of healthcare reform, new legislation or implementation of existing statutory provisions on importation of lower-cost competing drugs from other jurisdictions and legislation on comparative effectiveness research are examples of previously enacted and possible future changes in laws that could adversely affect our business.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from\ngovernment-funded healthcare programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nHealth care reform could increase our expenses and adversely affect the commercial success of our products.\nThe PPACA includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies, some of which became effective immediately upon enactment of the law, and others of which are scheduled to take effect over the next several years. For example, the PPACA seeks to expand healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The PPACA also imposes substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit and an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the U.S. The PPACA also requires increased disclosure obligations-including those required under the \u201csunshine\u201d laws-and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics and contains cost-containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products. These and other aspects of the PPACA, including the regulations that may be imposed in connection with the implementation of the PPACA, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe are subject to certain data privacy and security requirements, which are very complex and difficult to comply with at times. Any failure to ensure adherence to these requirements could subject us to fines and penalties, and damage our reputation.\nWe are required to comply, as applicable, with numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, which govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who may prescribe products we may sell in the future and from whom we may obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). We are not a HIPAA covered entity, do not intend to become one, and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, these privacy and security requirements do not apply to us. However, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA. We are unable to predict whether our actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to us. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business, and any failure to comply could result in harm to our reputation, and potentially fines and penalties.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of clinical trial participants and employees. Similarly, our third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. Thus, any access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at our partners or third-party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business.\nOur use of hazardous materials could subject us to liabilities, fines and sanctions.\nOur laboratory and clinical testing sometimes involve use of hazardous, radioactive or otherwise toxic materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing how we use, manufacture, handle, store and dispose of these materials.\nAlthough we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with all federal, state and local regulations and standards, there is always the risk of accidental contamination or injury from\nthese materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and we could also be subject to fines and penalties and such liability and costs could exceed our financial resources. If we fail to comply with these regulations and standards or with the conditions attached to our operating licenses, the licenses could be revoked, and we could be subjected to criminal sanctions and substantial financial liability or be required to suspend or modify our operations. Compliance with environmental and other laws may be expensive and current or future regulations may impair our product development efforts.\nRisks Related To Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose valuable assets or incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain trade secret protection, as well as successfully defending these patents against challenges, while operating without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We have filed a number of U.S. patent applications on inventions relating to the composition of a variety of polymers, specific products, product groups and processing technology. We have filed a number of U.S. patent applications on inventions relating to the composition of a variety of polymers, specific products, product groups and processing technology. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 15 issued U.S. patents and an additional 47 issued (or registered) foreign patents. The patents on the bioerodible technologies expire between January 2017 and March 2026. The product SUSTOL is covered by patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Currently, the product SUSTOL is covered by seven patents issued in the U.S. and by 24 patents issued in foreign countries including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the EU, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and United Kingdom. U.S. patents covering SUSTOL have expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to November 2024; foreign patents covering SUSTOL have expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to September 2025. Granted patents include claims covering the product composition, methods of use and methods of preparation. Our policy is to actively seek patent protection in the United States and to pursue equivalent patent claims in selected foreign countries, thereby seeking patent coverage for novel technologies and compositions of matter that may be commercially important to the development of our business. Granted patents include claims covering the product composition, methods of use and methods of preparation. Our existing patents may not cover future products, additional patents may not be issued, and current patents, or patents issued in the future, may not provide meaningful protection or prove to be of commercial benefit.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies, including ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patent applications may not issue into patents, and any issued patents may not provide sufficient protection for our product candidates or provide sufficient protection to afford us a commercial advantage against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or circumvented. Patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in confidence for at least 18 months after their filing. Consequently, we cannot be certain that the patent applications we are pursuing will lead to the issuance of any patent or be free from infringement or other claims from other parties. Our competitors may also independently develop products similar to ours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to us or licensed by us. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.\nWe may enter into collaborative agreements which may subject us to obligations that must be fulfilled and require us to manage complex relationships with third parties. In the future, if we are unable to meet our obligations or manage our relationships with our collaborators under these agreements our revenue may decrease. The loss or diminution of our intellectual property rights could result in a decision by our third-party collaborators to terminate their agreements with us. In addition, these agreements are generally complex and contain provisions that could give rise to legal disputes, including potential disputes concerning ownership of intellectual property and data under collaborations. Such disputes can lead to lengthy, expensive litigation or arbitration, requiring us to divert management time and resources to such dispute.\nBecause the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies involve complex legal and factual questions, enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded to products and processes, including ours, in the U.S., remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. The recently enacted America Invents Act, which reformed certain patent laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As more products are commercialized using our proprietary product platforms, or as any product achieves greater commercial success, our patents become more likely to be subject to challenge by potential competitors.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions agreements with us. These agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances, and that all inventions arising out of the individual\u2019s relationship with us shall be our exclusive property. These agreements may be breached, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer our information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. We may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in trade secrets, technical know-how and other non-patented technology. We may have to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. In addition, interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications. Enforcing or defending our proprietary rights is expensive, could cause diversion of our resources and may not prove successful. In addition, courts outside the U.S. may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose the ability to exclude others from using our technology to develop or sell competing products.\nWe may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and any litigation could force us to stop developing or selling potential products and could be costly, divert management attention and harm our business.\nWe must be able to develop products without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. Because the markets in which we operate involve established competitors with significant patent portfolios, including patents relating to the composition of a variety of polymers, specific products, product groups and processing technology, it could be difficult for us to use our technologies or develop products without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Therefore, there is risk that third parties may make claims of infringement against our products or technologies. We may not be able to design around the patented\ntechnologies or inventions of others, and we may not be able to obtain licenses to use patented technologies on acceptable terms, or at all. If we cannot operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, we will not be able to develop or commercialize some or all of our product candidates, and consequently will not be able to earn product revenue.\nThere is considerable uncertainty within the pharmaceutical industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted to be infringed by any future manufacture, use or sale of our products. In part as a result of this uncertainty, there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. We may have to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties who infringe our patents and other intellectual property or challenge our patent or trademark applications. For example, in the U.S., putative generics of innovator drug products (including products in which the innovation comprises a new drug delivery method for an existing product, such as the drug delivery market occupied by us) may file Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\u201cANDA\u201d) and, in doing so, certify that their products either do not infringe the innovator\u2019s patents or that the innovator\u2019s patents are invalid. This often results in litigation between the innovator and the ANDA applicant. This type of litigation is commonly known as \u201cParagraph IV\u201d litigation in the U.S. These litigations could result in new or additional generic competition to any of our products that may be marketed in the future and a potential reduction in product revenue.\nIf we are required to defend ourselves in a patent-infringement lawsuit, we could incur substantial costs, and the lawsuit could divert management attention, regardless of the lawsuit\u2019s merit or outcome. These legal actions could seek damages and seek to enjoin testing, manufacturing and marketing of the accused product or process. In addition to potential liability for significant damages, we could be required to redesign affected products or obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the accused product or process and any license required under any such patent may not be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our products. Any litigation, including any interference or derivation proceedings to determine priority of inventions, oppositions or other post-grant review proceedings to patents in the U.S. or in countries outside the U.S., or litigation against our partners may be costly and time-consuming and could harm our business. We expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope and/or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights or hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products.\nPeriodically, we review publicly available information regarding the development efforts of others in order to determine whether these efforts may violate our proprietary rights. We may determine that litigation is necessary to enforce our proprietary rights against others. Such litigation could result in substantial expense, regardless of its outcome, and may not be resolved in our favor.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe stock markets, in general, and in particular with respect to biotech and life sciences companies, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations\nmay adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its volatility. Our stock price may be particularly volatile given the stage of our business, which is pre-commercial and subject to more speculation by stock market investors.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, litigation has often been brought against that company. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could be extremely expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and our company\u2019s resources.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders.\nIn addition, Section 203 of Delaware General Corporation Law, which is applicable to us, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company by prohibiting stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us, unless certain approvals are obtained.\nConversion of our Convertible Notes would result in substantial dilution for our existing stockholders.\nOur outstanding Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum, payable quarterly in cash or in kind, at the election of the holders of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a rate of 1,250 shares for every $1,000 of principal and accrued interest that is being converted. In the event the holders of the Convertible Notes were to opt to convert in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest due under the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2015, we would be required to issue an aggregate of 7,086,560 shares, representing approximately 16% of our outstanding shares, after giving effect to such conversion. This would result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders.\nConcentration in stockholder ownership could influence strategic actions.\nOur directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities currently beneficially own or control a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. In addition, certain of our principal stockholders hold outstanding warrants that are exercisable for additional shares of our common stock. Based on information set forth in a Schedule 13D/A filed with the SEC on June 12, 2015, Tang Capital Partners, LP and its affiliates\u2019 (\u201cTCP\u201d) beneficial ownership in our common stock, as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, was approximately 14%, excluding the exercise of outstanding warrants. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, TCP has the right to acquire 5,669,248 shares upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. Kevin C. Tang, the Managing Director of Tang Capital Management, LLC, the general partner of Tang Capital Partners, LP, is also chairman of our Board of Directors.\nSuch a substantial concentration of common stock ownership or control could significantly influence corporate actions on various strategic matters, including, for example, receptivity to collaborations and merger or sale overtures to the extent that stockholder approval is required for such transactions. Further, covenants contained in the Convertible Notes would require approval from the noteholders for any change of control transaction we might consider. Accordingly, we may only be able to pursue transactions that are supported by these large stockholders. In addition, the conversion of the Convertible Notes, the exercise of these warrants, or the sale by our current stockholders of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such exercises or sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nFuture utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards may be impaired due to recent changes in ownership.\nWe believe our net operating losses and tax attributes may be subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. As a result, our deferred tax assets, and related valuation allowance, have been reduced for the estimated impact of the net operating losses and credits that we currently estimate may expire unused. Utilization of our remaining net operating loss and research and development credit carry-forwards may still be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions for ownership changes after December 31, 2015, including those that may come in conjunction with future equity financings or market trades by our stockholders.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders.\nProxy contests have been waged against many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry over the last few years. If faced with a proxy contest, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest, which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest involving us because:\n\u2022 responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees, and can lead to uncertainty;\n\u2022 perceived uncertainties as to future direction may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022 if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan in a timely manner and create additional value for our stockholders.\nThese actions could cause the market price of our common stock to experience periods of volatility.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC, the NASDAQ Stock Market or other regulatory authorities.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the source of gain for our stockholders.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our current and future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 11636, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HRTX"}
