{"cik": "1024126", "company": "PERNIX THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could be negatively impacted. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known that may materially adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur business operations and financial position could be adversely affected as a result of our substantial indebtedness and other payment obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $330.2 million aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding, consisting of approximately $35.7 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25%/5.25% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2022 (the Exchangeable Notes), issued pursuant to a new indenture, under which Pernix Ireland Pain Designated Activity Company, or PIP DAC, formerly known as Pernix Ireland Pain Limited (PIPL), is the issuer and we and our other subsidiaries are the guarantors with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, of approximately $78.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Notes due 2021(the Convertible Notes), approximately $172.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 12% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the Treximet Secured Notes), approximately $14.2 million outstanding under our five-year $40 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the New ABL Facility), and approximately $30 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under PIP DAC's new term loan credit agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, as agent and the lenders party thereto (the Term Credit Agreement), and together with the New ABL Facility, the Credit Facilities. In addition, we have the ability to borrow up to an additional $15.0 million under the Term Credit Agreement for certain specified purposes, including future acquisitions, subject to conditions set forth in the Term Credit Agreement, and up to an additional approximately $26 million under the New ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base capacity and the conditions set forth in the New ABL Facility. In addition, the Term Credit Agreement includes an incremental feature that allows us, with the consent of the requisite lenders under the Term Credit Agreement, to obtain up to an additional $20 million in term loan commitments from new or existing lenders under the Term Credit Agreement that agree to provide such commitments. We owed approximately $6.7 million to GSK pursuant to the Interim Settlement Agreement between us and GSK, as amended by Amendment No. 2 to the Interim Settlement Agreement, which was paid in full at the end of 2017. Our significant indebtedness and other payment obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding notes and our other indebtedness and contractual and commercial commitments;\nrequire us to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, entering new markets or exploiting business opportunities;\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionally less debt;\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds and/or leverage our cost of borrowing; and\ndecrease our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn the event our capital resources are otherwise insufficient to meet future capital requirements and operating expenses, we may seek to finance our cash needs through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic relationships, including the divestiture of non-core assets, assigning receivables, milestone payments or royalty rights, or other arrangements. Securing additional financing will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a\ndisproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management's ability to conduct our day-to-day operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\nsell our business or all or substantially all of our assets to one or more third parties;\nseek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection;\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our products and product candidates;\nseek collaborators for one or more of our current or future products or product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nAdditional equity or debt financing, or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements, may not be permissible under the indentures governing our outstanding notes or the covenants in the agreements governing our credit facilities, or otherwise available on acceptable terms, if at all. Additional equity financing will be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve additional restrictive covenants. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations or other strategic transactions, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nRecent reductions in workforce associated with our realignment plan could disrupt the operation of our business, distract our management from focusing on revenue-generating efforts, result in the erosion of employee morale, and impair our ability to respond rapidly to growth opportunities in the future.\nWe recently completed a realignment plan in January 2018 that resulted in personnel reduction of approximately 22% of our workforce, primarily through a reduction of sales and commercial infrastructure positions. The employee reductions could result in an erosion of morale and affect the focus and productivity of our remaining employees, including those directly responsible for revenue generation and the management and administration of our finances, which in turn may adversely affect our revenue in the future or cause other administrative deficiencies. Additionally, employees directly affected by the reductions may seek future employment with our business partners, customers or competitors. We may face wrongful termination, discrimination, or other claims from employees affected by the reduction related to their employment and termination. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against such claims, regardless of the merits of such actions. Furthermore, such matters could divert the attention of our employees, including management, away from our operations, harm productivity, harm our reputation and increase our expenses. We cannot assure you that our realignment plan will be successful, and we may need to take additional realignment efforts, including additional personnel reduction, in the future.\nWe may not be able to grow through acquisitions of businesses and assets, the formation of collaborations or other strategic alliances or the in-licensing of products or product candidates.\nWe have sought growth largely through acquisitions, including the acquisitions of the Zohydro ER product line in 2015, the rights to Treximet intellectual property in 2014, Pernix Sleep in 2013 and Cypress in 2012. As part of our strategy, we plan to pursue acquisitions of assets, businesses or strategic alliances and collaborations (including the in-licensing of products or product-candidates), to expand our existing technologies and operations. However, the indentures governing the Exchangeable Notes, the Convertible Notes and the Treximet Secured Notes, and the agreements governing our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants, which include, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, as well as certain consolidations, acquisitions, mergers, purchases or sales of assets and capital expenditures, subject to certain exceptions and permissions limited in scope and dollar value, among other things. For additional information see the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Moreover, we cannot assure you that acquisitions will be available on terms attractive to us or that such acquisitions will be permissible under the indentures governing our outstanding notes and the covenants in the agreements governing our credit facilities or that we will be able to arrange financing on terms acceptable to us or to obtain timely federal and state governmental approvals on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or assets and realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or other collaborations or strategic alliances.\nManagement has in the past devoted, and will in the future devote, significant attention and resources to integrating newly acquired businesses and assets and/or establishing functioning collaborations that leverage our capabilities in pursuit of developing and commercializing our products and product candidates. Potential difficulties we have or may in the future encounter in the integration process include the following:\nthe inability to successfully combine our businesses with any newly acquired business, to integrate any newly acquired assets into our existing product portfolio, and to meet our capital requirements following such acquisition, in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings or revenue enhancements anticipated to result from these acquisitions, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\nlost sales and customers as a result of certain of our customers deciding not to do business with us following the acquisition of a business or asset;\nthe additional complexities of integrating newly acquired businesses and assets with different core products and markets;\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with an acquisition of a business or asset; and\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by integrating the operations of a newly acquired business or a newly acquired asset into the existing product portfolio.\nour collaborative partners may not commit adequate resources to the development, marketing and distribution of any collaboration products, limiting our potential revenues from these products;\nour collaborative partners may experience financial difficulties and may therefore be unable to meet their commitments to us;\nour collaborative partners may pursue a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors; and\nour collaborative partners may terminate our relationship.\nWith respect to potential collaborations or strategic alliances, our ability to reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to reduce or delay our development or commercialization programs or initiatives.\nFor all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that integrating a newly acquired business or asset and/or the establishment of collaborations or other strategic alliances could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our products, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\nDespite our significant level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although certain of our agreements, including the agreements governing our credit facilities and the indentures governing the Exchangeable Notes, the Convertible Notes and the Treximet Secured Notes, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to waiver and a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred following receipt of a waiver or in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Among other things, we have the ability to borrow up to an additional $15.0 million under the Term Credit Agreement for certain specified purposes, including future acquisitions, subject to conditions set forth in the Term Credit Agreement, and approximately $26 million of additional funds under the New ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base capacity and the conditions set forth in the New ABL Facility. In addition, the Term Credit Agreement includes an incremental feature that allows us, with the consent of the requisite lenders under the Term Credit Agreement, to obtain up to an additional $20 million in term loan commitments from new or existing lenders under the Term Credit Agreement that agree to provide such commitments. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our substantial leverage described herein, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase.\nOur debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, we may have to delay or curtail our operations.\nOur ability to generate cash flows from operations and to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness will depend on our future financial performance. Our future financial performance will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors that we cannot control, such as those risks described in this section and in our other filings with the SEC. A significant reduction in operating cash flows resulting from changes in economic conditions, increased competition or other events beyond our control could increase the need for additional or alternative sources of liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and our ability to service our debt and other obligations. If we are unable to service our indebtedness we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital, or seeking Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Court protection.\nThese alternative strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms, if at all, and they may not yield sufficient funds to make required payments on our indebtedness.\nIf for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt, which may allow our creditors at that time to declare outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements.\nIn addition, the borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and other debt we incur could likewise be variable-rate debt. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed thereunder remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nThe indentures governing the Exchangeable Notes, the Convertible Notes and the Treximet Secured Notes and the covenants in the agreements governing our credit facilities impose significant operating and/or financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nThe indentures governing the Exchangeable Notes, the Convertible Notes and the Treximet Secured Notes and the agreements governing our credit facilities contain covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to take various actions, such as:\nincur additional debt;\npay dividends and make distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock;\nmake certain investments, purchase certain assets or other restricted payments;\nsell assets, including in connection with sale-leaseback transactions;\ncreate liens;\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\nmake lease payments that exceed a specified amount; and\nmerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.\nIn addition, the terms of the Treximet Secured Notes require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $8.0 million at all times and the terms of the New ABL Facility require us to maintain unrestricted minimum liquidity of $7.5 million at all times. In order to maintain minimum liquidity, we must maintain cash or the availability to borrow cash under the New ABL Facility in a combined amount of no less than the minimum liquidity set forth in the Treximet Secured Notes indenture and the New ABL Facility.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as described in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, holders of the Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a holder elects to convert its Convertible Notes for shares in excess of the conversion cap, as described in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, we will be obligated to deliver cash in lieu of any share that was not delivered on account of such limitation. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the\nConvertible Notes surrendered therefor in connection with a fundamental change or payments of cash on Convertible Notes converted in excess of the conversion cap. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other outstanding indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions as required by the indenture.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as described in the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes, holders of the Exchangeable Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of Exchangeable Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the capitalized principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the Exchangeable Notes surrendered therefor in connection with a fundamental change. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Exchangeable Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Exchangeable Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other outstanding indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Exchangeable Notes or make cash payments upon conversions as required by the indenture.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements. Our failure to comply with our debt-related obligations could result in an event of default under the particular debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the indebtedness under that instrument and, in some cases, the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part.\nThese restrictions also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions including transactions, collaborations or other commercial transactions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nOur ability to borrow under the New ABL Facility is limited by the amount of our borrowing base. Any negative impact on the elements of our borrowing base, such as accounts receivable and inventory or an imposition of a reserve against our borrowing base, which Cantor Fitzgerald Securities has the authority to do in its sole discretion, could reduce our borrowing capacity under the New ABL Facility.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our products.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial personnel. We are highly dependent upon our executive management team. The loss of the services of any members of our executive management team or other key personnel could delay or prevent the successful completion of some of our development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nOur management devotes substantial time to comply with public company regulations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market, imposes various requirements on public companies, including with respect to corporate governance practices. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that our management maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and, as applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 requires us to incur substantial accounting and related expenses and expend significant management efforts. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, our financial reporting could be unreliable and misinformation could be disseminated to the public.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal control over financial reporting could harm our operating results and prevent us from meeting our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause our stockholders and potential investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, investors relying upon this misinformation could make an uninformed investment decision and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq Global Market or other regulatory authorities, or to stockholder class action securities litigation.\nOur April 2015 acquisition of Zohydro ER and the August 2014 acquisition of the rights to Treximet intellectual property and our strategy of obtaining, through asset acquisitions and in-licenses, rights to other products and product candidates for our development pipeline and to proprietary drug delivery and formulation technologies for our life cycle management of current products may not be successful.\nWe acquired the rights to Zohydro ER in April 2015 and Treximet intellectual property in August 2014 and from time to time we may seek to engage in additional strategic transactions with third parties to acquire rights to other pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical product candidates in the late stages of development and proprietary drug delivery and formulation technologies. Because we do not have discovery and research capabilities, the growth of our business will depend in significant part on our ability to acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates or proprietary drug delivery and formulation technologies that we believe have significant commercial potential and are consistent with our commercial objectives. However, we may be unable to license or acquire suitable products, product candidates or technologies from third parties for a number of reasons.\nThe licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products, product candidates and related technologies is a competitive area. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products, product candidates and drug delivery and formulation technologies, which may mean fewer suitable acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices. Many of our competitors have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nOther factors that may prevent us from licensing or otherwise acquiring suitable products, product candidates or technologies include:\nwe may be unable to license or acquire the relevant products, product candidates or technologies on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on investment;\ncompanies that perceive us as a competitor may be unwilling to license or sell their product rights or technologies to us;\nwe may be unable to identify suitable products, product candidates or technologies within our areas of expertise;\nwe may have inadequate cash resources or may be unable to obtain financing to acquire rights to suitable products, product candidates or technologies from third parties; and\nwe may be restricted from licensing or otherwise acquiring suitable products due to restrictions contained in the indentures governing the Exchangeable Notes, the Convertible Notes and the Treximet Secured Notes and the restrictions contained in the covenants in the agreements governing our credit facilities.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify and acquire rights to products, product candidates and proprietary drug delivery and formulation technologies and successfully integrate them into our operations, we may not be able to increase our revenues in future periods, which could result in significant harm to our financial condition, results of operations and development prospects.\nIf we fail to successfully manage any acquisitions, our ability to develop our product candidates and expand our product pipeline may be harmed.\nOur failure to adequately address the financial, operational or legal risks of any acquisitions or in-license arrangements could harm our business. Financial aspects of these transactions that could alter our financial position, reported operating results or stock price include:\nuse of cash resources;\nhigher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities;\nthe incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, impairment losses or restructuring charges;\nlarge write-offs and difficulties in assessing the relative percentages of in-process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount that must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset; and\namortization expenses related to other intangible assets.\nOperational risks that could harm our existing operations or prevent realization of anticipated benefits from these transactions include:\nchallenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business;\ndisruption of our ongoing business;\ndifficulty and expense in assimilating the operations, products, technology, information systems or personnel of the acquired company;\ndiversion of management's time and attention from other business concerns;\nentry into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience;\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\nthe assumption of known and unknown liabilities of the acquired business or asset, including intellectual property claims; and\nsubsequent loss of key personnel.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our licensing or acquisitions, our ability to develop and commercialize new products and continue to expand our product pipeline may be limited.\nIf we are unable to effectively train and equip our sales force to sell newly acquired, in-licensed and existing products, our ability to successfully commercialize our products will be harmed.\nWe have in the past made, and may in the future continue to make, acquisitions or in-licenses of pharmaceutical products. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, turnover of some of our sales representatives that we hired or will hire, requiring us to train new sales representatives. The members of our sales force may have no prior experience promoting the pharmaceutical products that we own or may acquire or in-license in the future. As a result, we expend significant time and resources to train our sales force to be credible and persuasive in convincing physicians to prescribe and pharmacists to dispense these pharmaceutical products. In addition, we must train our sales force to ensure that a consistent and appropriate message about our products is being delivered to our potential customers. Our sales representatives may also experience challenges promoting multiple products when they call on physicians and their office staff. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with effective materials relating to our pharmaceutical products, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate potential customers about the benefits of such products and their proper administration and label indication, our efforts to successfully market these pharmaceutical products could be put in jeopardy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, stock price and operations.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nWhen our patent rights expire, previously protected products may become subject to competition from generic versions, which may lower our net revenue.\nWe own, have applied for or hold licenses to patents. Our patent protection for our products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents. The protection afforded is limited by the applicable terms of our patents and the availability of legal remedies in the United States. Following expiration of patents covering our products, other entities may be able to obtain approval to manufacture and market generic alternatives, which we expect would result in lower net revenue. For example, in August 2014, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Pernix Ireland Limited (PIL), we acquired the U.S. intellectual property rights to Treximet from GSK. Treximet is covered by five patents in the U.S. Including six months of pediatric exclusivity, four of the patents expired on February 14, 2018, and one expires on April 2, 2026. Six companies filed Abbreviated\nNew Drug Applications, or ANDAs, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, seeking approval to market a generic version of Treximet. Three of the ANDA filers are enjoined from engaging in the commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sale in or importation into the United States of the proposed ANDA products prior to April 2, 2026. One of the two ANDA filers that were legally able to launch their generic versions of Treximet on February 15, 2018 did enter the market. The one ANDA filer that could have launched as early as January 3, 2018 has not yet entered the market. While we launched our own generic version of Treximet on February 15, 2018, the entry of generics into the market will likely have a significant adverse impact on our sales of Treximet and, ultimately, our results of operations.\nThe commercial success of our currently marketed products and any additional products that we successfully commercialize will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nAny products that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not be profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including:\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effect;\nthe efficacy and potential advantages over the alternative treatments;\nthe ability to offer our branded products for sale at competitive prices, including in relation to any generic products;\nsubstitution of our branded products with generic equivalents at the pharmacy level;\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support; and\nsufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nWe face competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nThe Industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Our competitors include large and small pharmaceutical companies, and other private and public research organizations. We face significant competition for our currently marketed products, including significant price competition from products for the same therapeutic categories. Some of our currently marketed products do not have patent protection and face or could face generic competition.\nSome or all of our products may face competition from other branded and generic drugs approved for the same therapeutic indications, approved drugs used \"off-label\" for such indications and novel drugs in clinical development. As a result, our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than our products.\nOur patent rights may not adequately protect our products or product candidates if competitors develop products that compete with us without legally infringing our patent rights. Further, our patent rights may be subject to challenge by branded and generic competition.\nThe FDCA and FDA regulations and policies provide certain exclusivity incentives to manufacturers to develop generic versions of innovator products and 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. A generic manufacturer may only be required to show that its proposed generic product has the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration and indication as, and is bioequivalent to, our brand-name product. The development costs for such generic products would be significantly less than those for our brand-name products and could lead to the emergence of multiple lower-priced competitor products, which would substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our brand-name products. Additionally, other branded competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates, and they may obtain periods of exclusivity under applicable laws that may delay our own products' approval by the FDA.\nProducts in our portfolio that do not have patent protection are potentially at risk for generic competition. Additionally, products we sell through our collaborative or co-promotion arrangements may also face competition in the marketplace. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in marketing and sales, research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products and thus may be better equipped than us to discover, develop, manufacture and commercialize products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel and acquiring technologies. Many of our competitors have collaborative arrangements in our target\nmarkets with leading companies and research institutions. In many cases, products that compete with our products have already received regulatory approval or are in late-stage development, have well-known brand names, are distributed by large pharmaceutical companies with substantial resources and have achieved widespread acceptance among physicians and patients. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nWe may face competition based on the safety and effectiveness of our products, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent position and other factors. Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer or more affordable products, or products with more effective patent protection, than our products. Accordingly, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we are able to, which would adversely affect our competitive position, our revenue and profit from existing products and anticipated revenue and profit from product candidates. If our products or product candidates are rendered noncompetitive, we may not be able to recover the expenses of developing and commercializing those products or product candidates.\nIf our competitors sell generic equivalents of our products, our net revenues from such products are expected to decline.\nProduct sales of generic pharmaceutical products often follow a particular pattern over time based on regulatory and competitive factors. The first company to introduce a generic equivalent of a branded product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market. However, as other companies introduce competing generic products, the first entrant's market share, and the price of its generic product, will typically decline. The extent of the decline generally depends on several factors, including the number of competitors, the price of the branded product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors.\nFor example, in the generic drug industry, when a company is the first to introduce a generic drug, the pricing of the generic drug is typically set based on a discount from the published price of the equivalent branded product. Other generic manufacturers may enter the market and, as a result, the price of the drug may decline significantly. In such event, we may in our discretion provide our customers a credit with respect to the customers' remaining inventory for the difference between our new price and the price at which we originally sold the product to our customers. There are circumstances under which we may, as a matter of business strategy, not provide price adjustments to certain customers and, consequently, we may lose future sales to competitors.\nNegative publicity regarding any of our products or product candidates could delay or impair our ability to market any such product, delay or prevent approval of any such product candidate and may require us to spend time and money to address these issues.\nIf any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to consumers and/or subject to FDA enforcement action, our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be impaired. Because of our dependence on patient and physician perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies could limit the commercial potential of our products and expose us to potential liabilities.\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain qualified sales and management personnel and successfully manage our sales and marketing programs and resources, or if our commercial partners do not adequately perform, the commercial opportunity for our products may be diminished.\nWe and any other commercialization partner we engage may not be able to attract, hire, train and retain qualified sales and sales management personnel in the future. If we or they are not successful in maintaining an effective number of qualified sales personnel, our ability to effectively market and promote our products may be impaired. Even if we are able to effectively maintain such sales personnel, their efforts may not be successful in commercializing our products.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the revenues that we might receive from sales of products that are the subject to commercial partnerships could largely depend upon the efforts our partners. The efforts of partners, in many instances, could likely be outside our control. If we are unable to maintain commercial partnerships or to effectively establish alternative arrangements for our products, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, despite arrangements with other partners, we still may not be able to cover all of the prescribing physicians for our products at the same level of reach and frequency as our competitors, and we ultimately may need to further expand our selling efforts in order to effectively compete.\nFrom time to time, we compliment the efforts of our sales force with on-line and other non-personal promotional initiatives that target both physicians and patients. We also focus upon ensuring broad patient access to our products by negotiating agreements with leading commercial managed care organizations, or MCOs, and with government payors. Although our goal is to achieve sales through the efficient execution of our sales and marketing plans and programs, we may not be able to effectively generate prescriptions and achieve broad market acceptance for our products on a timely basis, or at all.\nA failure to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand for our products could harm our reputation and subject us to financial losses.\nOur product, Zohydro ER with BeadTek, contains a controlled substance that is regulated by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. DEA quota requirements applicable to Schedule I and II controlled substances limit the amount of controlled substance drug products a manufacturer can manufacture and the amount of API it can use to manufacture those products. We may experience difficulties obtaining raw materials needed to manufacture such product as a result of DEA regulations. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining quotas, unable to manufacture and release inventory on a timely and consistent basis, fail to maintain an adequate level of product inventory, or if inventory is destroyed or damaged or reaches its expiration date, patients might not have access to our product, our reputation and our brands could be harmed and physicians may be less likely to prescribe such product in the future, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and our contract manufacturers may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals or clearances that are necessary to manufacture pharmaceutical products.\nBefore approving a new drug, the FDA requires that the facilities in which the product will be manufactured be in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements, which include, among other things, requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, maintenance of records and documentation and utilization of qualified raw materials. To be successful, our products must be manufactured in compliance with cGMP during development and, following approval, in commercial quantities and at acceptable costs.\nWe and our contract manufacturers must comply with these cGMP requirements. While we believe that we and our contract manufacturers currently meet these requirements, we cannot assure that the manufacturing facilities used to manufacture and package our products will continue to meet cGMP requirements or will be sufficient to manufacture all of our needs and/or the needs of our customers for commercial materials.\nWe and our contract manufacturers may also encounter problems with the following:\nproduction yields;\npossible facility contamination;\nquality control and quality assurance programs;\nshortages of qualified personnel;\ncompliance with FDA or other regulatory authorities' regulations, including the demonstration of purity and potency;\nchanges in FDA or other regulatory authorities' requirements;\nproduction costs; and/or\ndevelopment of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls.\nIn addition, we and our contract manufacturers must register our manufacturing facilities with the FDA, and our facilities are subject to FDA inspections to confirm continuing compliance with cGMP and other regulations. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA may impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, temporary or permanent refusal to permit us or our contract manufacturers to continue manufacturing approved products. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with regulatory requirements for our controlled substance product, Zohydro ER with BeadTek, the DEA may take regulatory actions detrimental to our business, resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of distribution, withdrawal of such product from the market or other penalties.\nWe, our third-party manufacturers and our Zohydro with BeadTek product, are subject to the Controlled Substances Act and DEA regulations thereunder. Accordingly, we must adhere to a number of requirements, including registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; labeling and packaging requirements; security controls, procurement and manufacturing quotas; and certain restrictions on refills. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.\nChanges in laws, regulations and policies applicable to the market for opioid products, litigation and government investigations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of Zohydro ER are subject to comprehensive government regulations. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to the market for opioid products, including Zohydro ER with BeadTek, could potentially affect our business. For instance, federal, state and local governments have recently given increased attention to the public health issue of opioid abuse.\nAt the federal level, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy continues to coordinate efforts between the FDA, the DEA, and other agencies to address this issue. The FDA recently requested that Endo International plc, or Endo, withdraw Opana \u00ae ER, one of its opioid pain medications, from the market due to the public health consequences of abuse (even when taken at recommended doses) associated with the use of Endo's product. Endo voluntarily complied with the FDA's removal request. In publicly announcing the request, the FDA noted that it would take similar regulatory action with regard to other opioid products if the risks for abuse outweighed the product's potential benefits. The FDA also recently revised the \"black-box\" warnings required in the labeling of opioid paid medications, including Zohydro ER with BeadTek, that highlight the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death. The DEA continues its efforts to hold manufacturers, distributors, prescribers and pharmacies accountable through various enforcement actions, as well as the implementation of compliance practices for controlled substances. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issued national, non-binding guidelines in 2016 relative to the prescribing of opioids. These guidelines included recommended considerations for primary care provider use when prescribing opioids, including specific considerations and cautionary information about opioid dosage increases and morphine milligram equivalents. Certain payors are, or are considering, adopting these CDC guidelines, as well as putting other restrictions on the prescribing of opioid pain medications. Additionally, the Trump administration and certain members of Congress have called for the DEA to restrict the quantity of opioids that can be manufactured in the United States.\nRecent federal activity includes the issuance of a Presidential commission's final recommendations on combating opioid abuse; the federal Department of Health and Human Services declaring the opioid crisis a national public health emergency; President Trump's establishing a commission to make recommendations regarding new laws and policies to combat opioid addiction and abuse; Mallinckrodt's $35.0 million settlement with the Justice Department regarding allegations that the company failed to report signs that large quantities of its highly addictive oxycodone pills were diverted to the black market in Florida; and the FDA's announced intention to extend to immediate-release opioids the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, currently imposed on extended-release opioids, such as Zohydro ER. At the state and local level, a number of states and major cities have brought separate lawsuits against various pharmaceutical companies marketing and selling opioid based pain medications, alleging misleading or otherwise improper promotion of opioid drugs to physicians and consumers. In addition, the attorneys general from several states have announced the launch of a joint investigation into the marketing and sales practices of drug companies that manufacture opioid pain medications.\nThese initiatives and other changes and potential changes in laws, regulations and policies, including those that have the effect of reducing the overall market for opioids or reducing the prescribing of opioids, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ceasing the distribution of our combination drug product IDA will impact our net revenues. In the future, FDA could also request that we no longer market and distribute certain of our other DESI, OTC, medical foods and dietary supplement products.\nThrough our Macoven entity, Pernix distributed a combination product called isometheptene mucate, dichlorphenazone, and acetaminophen, or IDA, which was originally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 1948 for safety only. The product's efficacy as an adjunct treatment for peptic ulcer disease, as well as other medical conditions, such as migraine headaches, was reviewed under the FDA's Drug Efficacy Study Implementation process, DESI notice 3265.\nOn October 20, 2017, we received a letter dated October 19, 2017 from the FDA asserting that IDA was subject to DESI 3265 and that any drug products identified in DESI 3265, including IDA, require an approved NDA or ANDA in order for them to continue to be distributed. Since we have not obtained an NDA or ANDA for IDA, the FDA directed that we should immediately cease distribution of IDA. While IDA has a long history of safe use, we complied with the FDA's request and confirmed with the FDA within the requested time frame that we ceased distribution of the product. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net revenues from the sale of IDA were $14.9 million. As we will not have further revenues from the product in 2018, the discontinuance of the product will impact net revenues for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, it is possible that the FDA could in the future request that we no longer distribute certain of our DESI, OTC, medical foods and dietary supplement products, which could adversely affect our net revenues.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our currently marketed products and any other products that we successfully develop or commercialize. For example, at the state and local level, a number of states and major cities have brought separate lawsuits against various pharmaceutical companies marketing and selling opioid based pain medications, alleging misleading or otherwise improper promotion of opioid drugs to physicians and consumers. In addition, the attorneys general from several states have announced the launch of a joint investigation into the marketing and sales practices of drug companies that manufacture opioid pain medications. While we are not a party to these actions, it is possible that we could be included in them in the future.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our products or product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\ndecreased demand for our products or any products that we may develop;\ninjury to reputation;\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\nwithdrawal of a product from the market;\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\ndiversion of management time and attention;\nloss of revenue; and\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nThe amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we might incur. Further, there may be instances where our existing insurance coverage will not respond to or cover a claimed liability or where our insurers may dispute whether their insurance contracts must legally respond to such claimed liabilities. In such instances, we may not have insurance funds available to cover such liabilities, as well as the legal defense costs that would have to be incurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations. Finally, insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nWe generally experience some effects of seasonality due to our patients resetting their deductible amounts in the beginning of the calendar year and reaching their deductible amounts during the year. Accordingly, sales of our products and associated revenue have generally decreased in the first quarter of each year and begin to increase during the remainder of the year. This seasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results. In addition, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality that we experience may change.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe may face delays in the development and commercialization of, or be unable to meet demand for, our products and may lose potential revenues if the manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our products in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers.\nWe do not manufacture our marketed products, and we do not currently plan to develop any capacity to do so. We rely on third parties to manufacture our products. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations.\nOur manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to sell our marketed products or any other product candidate that we commercialize would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in our ability to meet commercial demand for our marketed products will result in the loss of potential revenues.\nFor example, we recently announced that, due to a manufacturing issue with our supplier, we expect that the 20 mg. strength of Zohydro ER with BeadTek will be on back order until at least the first quarter of 2018. During this time, we will continue to market and distribute other strengths of Zohydro ER with BeadTek, including the 10 mg., 15 mg., 30 mg., 40 mg. and 50 mg. strengths. While utilization of the 10 mg., 15 mg. and 30 mg. strengths are expected to increase in order to fulfill patient needs, the temporary stock-out of the 20 mg. strength has and will continue to impact the overall prescription volume for Zohydro ER with BeadTek, which may result in a continued loss of revenue and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, in connection with our acquisition of the rights to Treximet intellectual property in August 2014, we discovered short-term supply constraints for the product. While we believe that we have addressed this issue by securing another manufacturer, our failure to obtain sufficient supply of Treximet to meet anticipated demand in the future may result in the loss of potential revenues\nAll manufacturers of pharmaceutical products must comply with the FDA's current cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA is also likely to conduct inspections of our manufacturers' facilities as part of their review of any NDAs we submit to the FDA. These cGMP requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety, efficacy, or quantities of our drug products are compromised due to our manufacturers' failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products.\nMoreover, our manufacturers and suppliers may experience difficulties related to their overall businesses and financial stability, which could result in delays or interruptions of our supply of our marketed products. We do not have alternate manufacturing plans in place at this time. If we need to change to other manufacturers, the FDA must approve these manufacturers' facilities and processes in advance, which would require new testing and compliance inspections. Moreover, new manufacturers may have to be trained in or independently develop the processes necessary for production.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect the commercial activities for our marketed products and required approvals for any other product candidate that we develop, or entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our products. Furthermore, if our manufacturers failed to deliver the required commercial quantities of raw materials, including bulk drug substance, or finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues.\nThe concentration of our product sales to only a few wholesale distributors increases the risk that we will not be able to effectively distribute our products if we need to replace any of these customers, which would cause our sales to decline.\nThe majority of our sales are to a small number of pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which in turn sell our products primarily to retail pharmacies, which ultimately dispense our products to the end consumers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation accounted for 34%, 24% and 30%, respectively, of our total gross sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation accounted for 36%, 26% and 31%, respectively, of our total gross sales.\nIf any of these customers cease doing business with us or materially reduce the amount of product they purchase from us and we cannot conclude agreements with replacement wholesale distributors on commercially reasonable terms, we might not be able to effectively distribute our products through retail pharmacies. The possibility of this occurring is exacerbated by the recent significant consolidation in the wholesale drug distribution industry, including through mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drugstore chains. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we enter into may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nWe enter into collaboration arrangements from time to time on a selective basis. Our collaborations may not be successful. In the future, we might market certain branded and generic products in the U.S. pursuant to collaboration arrangements. The success of such collaboration arrangements may depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.\nDisagreements between parties to collaboration arrangements regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercialization of applicable product candidates and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority.\nOur business could suffer as a result of a failure to manage and maintain our distribution network with our wholesale customers.\nWe depend on the distribution abilities of our wholesale customers to ensure that our products are effectively distributed through the supply chain. If there are any interruptions in our customers' ability to distribute products through their distribution centers, our products may not be effectively distributed, which could cause confusion and frustration among pharmacists and lead to product substitution.\nTo the extent that we conduct clinical trials, we plan to rely on third parties to conduct these trials and such third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not plan to independently conduct clinical trials for product candidates that we might acquire in the future and, instead, would rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators. Reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities would reduce our control over these activities, although we would remain responsible for ensuring that clinical trials performed at our direction are conducted in accordance with approved investigational plans and approved clinical trial protocols. Moreover, the FDA requires compliance with good clinical practices for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Reliance on third parties does not relieve a sponsor of these responsibilities and requirements. Furthermore, these third parties could also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we might not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for future product candidates and may not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize such product candidates.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and business disputes that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and business disputes and additional claims may arise in the future. Current legal proceedings and disputes as well as those that may arise in the future may be complex and extended and may occupy the resources of our management and employees. These proceedings may also be costly to prosecute and defend and may involve substantial awards or damages payable by us if not found in our favor some or all of which may not be covered by our existing insurance coverage or might result in the granting of certain rights on unfavorable terms in order to settle such proceedings. Defending against or settling such claims and any unfavorable legal decisions, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. For more information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property relating to our products, the value of our products will be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our products. The patent situation in the field of pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions. We rely upon patents, trademarks, trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our products.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional patent rights relating to our products and pending patent applications to which we have rights may not issue as patents or may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Further, our patents could be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or held to be unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop third party competitors from marketing competing products. Moreover, some physicians may prescribe a competitive or similar product that is not approved by the FDA to treat patients with insomnia in lieu of prescribing Silenor and we cannot guarantee that our intellectual property will prevent or deter such \"off-label\" use.\nOur patent rights also may not afford us protection against all competitors. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including a transition from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system. Because patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to invent or file patent applications to the inventions. If a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application covering a similar invention, we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The specific type of proceeding will be determined by the filing date of the application for patent. If the application for patent was filed prior to March 15, 2013, such a proceeding would be an interference proceeding. For all applications filed after March 15, 2013, such a proceeding would be a derivation proceeding. Further, our patents may be challenged by one or more post-grant proceedings. The cost of any type of patent proceeding could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts could be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of patent protection. In addition, patents generally expire, regardless of the date of issue, 20 years from the earliest non- provisional effective U.S. filing date, thus loss of patent protection may occur from patent terms expiring.\nOur collaborators and licensors may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. These third parties may have the first right to maintain or defend our intellectual property rights and, although we may have the right to assume the maintenance and defense of our intellectual property rights if these third parties do not, our ability to maintain and defend our intellectual property rights may be compromised by the acts or omissions of these third parties.\nTrademark protection of our products may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage.\nWe use trademarks on our marketed, branded products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing those products and maintaining good will. Distinctive marks may also be important for any additional products that we successfully develop and/or commercially market. However, even though we register, maintain, monitor and defend our trademarks as necessary, we generally do not rely on our marks to provide a meaningful competitive advantage over other products. We believe that efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors are likely to continue to be more important factors in the commercial success of our products.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe have acquired rights to products and product candidates under license and co-promotion agreements with third parties and expect to enter into additional licenses and co-promotion agreements in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect that future licenses will impose, various development and commercialization, purchase commitment, royalty, sublicensing, patent protection and maintenance, insurance and other similar obligations on us.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole, terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages. Any such termination or claim could prevent or impede our ability to market any product that is covered by the license agreement. Even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful, our business could suffer. In addition, upon any termination of a license agreement, our market position could be impacted if we were legally required to provide a licensor with a license to use any related intellectual property that we developed.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patents and trademarks, we rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We require our relevant persons, such as employees, consultants and other third parties, including vendors (when appropriate), to execute confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions agreements with us.\nThese agreements may be breached, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer our information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, competitors may be able to use this information to develop products that compete with our products, which could adversely impact our business.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it may adversely affect our business.\nOur development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, may infringe or be claimed to infringe one or more claims of an issued patent or pending patent application which we do not hold a license or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents or patent applications and could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or our collaborators could be forced to stop or delay development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nIf any relevant claims of third-party patents that we are alleged to infringe are upheld as valid and enforceable in any litigation or administrative proceeding, we or our potential future collaborators could be prevented from commercializing a product, or maybe required to obtain licenses from the patent owners of each such patent, or to redesign our products, and could be liable for damages. There can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or, if available, would be available on acceptable terms, or that we would be successful in any attempt to redesign our products. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, failure to redesign, or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us or our future collaborators from manufacturing and selling our products and would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or acquisition strategy.\t\nWe make significant investments in our currently-marketed products for sales, marketing, and distribution. We have used, and expect to continue to use, revenue from sales of our marketed products to fund acquisitions (at least partially), for development costs and to establish and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nour ability to restructure our existing debt;\nour ability to successfully integrate the operations of newly acquired businesses and assets and/or in-licensed products or product candidates into our product portfolio;\nour ability to successfully establish and maintain collaborations or other strategic alliances;\nthe level of product sales from our currently marketed products and any additional products that we may market in the future;\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in products, businesses and technologies;\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of clinical development activities for our product candidates;\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\nthe number of, and development requirements for, additional product candidates that we pursue;\nthe costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution;\nthe extent to which we choose to establish additional collaboration, co-promotion, distribution or other similar arrangements for our products and product candidates; and\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims.\nWe intend to obtain any additional funding that we require through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic relationships, including the divestiture of non-core assets, assigning receivables, milestone payments or royalty rights, or other arrangements. We cannot assure such funding will be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Additional equity financing will be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations or other strategic transactions, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or we may have to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf efforts to raise additional funds are unsuccessful, we may be required to delay, scale-back or eliminate plans or programs relating to our business, relinquish some or all rights to our products or renegotiate less favorable terms with respect to such rights than we would otherwise agree to accept or we may have to cease operating as a going concern. In addition, if we do not meet our payment obligations to third parties as they come due, we may be subject to litigation claims. Even if we were successful in defending against these potential claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and might result in unfavorable results that could further adversely impact our financial condition\nIf we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investments.\nIf the estimates that we make, or the assumptions upon which we rely, in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate, our future financial results may vary from expectations.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. For example, at the same time we recognize revenues for product sales, we also record an adjustment, or decrease, to revenue for estimated charge backs, rebates, discounts, vouchers and returns, which management determines on a product-by-product basis as its best estimate at the time of sale based on each product's historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves. For new products, these sales adjustments may be estimated based upon information available on any similar products in the marketplace or specific information provided by business partners or if management is not able to derive a reasonable estimate for the adjustments, gross revenue can be deferred and recognized as the product is prescribed.\nActual sales allowances may vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including unanticipated competition, regulatory actions or changes in one or more of our contractual relationships. We cannot assure you, therefore, that there may not be material fluctuations between our estimates and the actual results.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net operating losses (\"NOLs\") of approximately $396.5 million for federal income tax purposes. Subject to applicable limitations, these NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income, to the extent we generate any taxable income, and thereby reduce our future federal income taxes otherwise payable.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" as defined in that section, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may become subject to significant limitations. In general terms, an ownership change occurs if there is a greater than 50 percentage point increase in the amount of the corporation's stock owned by certain stockholders during a three year testing period. An ownership change may be triggered by the purchase and sale, redemption, or new issuance of stock. $366.5 million of our NOLs are already subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code. We may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, which may result from, among other things, issuances of common stock, including upon the exercise by the holders of our existing convertible debt securities and any convertible debt securities we may offer in the future of the conversion rights under such instruments, and upon the exercise of stock options and other equity compensation awards. If a future ownership change were to be triggered, our ability to use some or all of our remaining NOLs could be significantly limited. Further, depending on the level of our taxable income, all or a portion of our NOLs may expire unutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income by the entire amount of our current and future NOLs.\nAdditionally, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation and modifies several existing laws around NOLs, including a limitation on the deduction for NOLs to 80 percent of current year taxable income as well as an indefinite carryover period for NOLs. Both provisions are applicable for losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. For these reasons, even if we generate taxable income in the future, our ability to utilize our NOLs may be limited, potentially significantly so.\nIf we fail to meet all applicable continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market and it determines to delist our common stock, the market liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we fail to meet all applicable listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market and it determines to delist our common stock, trading, if any, in our shares may continue to be conducted on an over-the-counter market, such as the OTCQX, OTCQB or the OTC Pink. Delisting of our shares would result in limited release of the market price of those shares and limited analyst coverage and could restrict investors' interest and confidence in our securities. Also, a delisting could have a material adverse effect on the trading market and prices for our shares and our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing. In addition, if our shares were not listed and the trading price of our shares was less than $5.00 per share, our shares could be subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act which, among other things, requires that broker/dealers satisfy special sales practice requirements, including making individualized written suitability determinations and receiving a purchaser's written consent prior to any transaction. In such case, our securities could also be deemed to be a \"penny stock\" under the Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, which would require additional disclosure in connection with trades in those shares, including the delivery of a disclosure schedule explaining the nature and risks of the penny stock market. Such requirements could severely limit the liquidity of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital.\nIf significant business or product announcements by us or our competitors cause fluctuations in our stock price, an investment in our stock may suffer a decline in value.\t\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility as a result of announcements by us or other companies in our industry, including our collaborators. Announcements that may subject the price of our common stock to substantial volatility include but are not limited to announcements regarding:\nour operating results, including the amount and timing of sales of our products and our ability to successfully integrate the operations of newly acquired businesses or products;\nthe availability and timely delivery of a sufficient supply of our products;\nthe safety and quality of our products or those of our competitors;\nour licensing and collaboration agreements and the products or product candidates that are the subject of those agreements;\nthe results of discoveries, preclinical studies and clinical trials by us or our competitors;\nthe acquisition of technologies, product candidates or products by us or our competitors;\nthe development of new technologies, product candidates or products by us or our competitors;\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or products or those of our competitors; and\nsignificant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\t\nWe did not make any distributions for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We are currently investing in our promoted products lines and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing our credit facilities and the indentures governing the Exchangeable Notes, the Convertible Notes and the Treximet Secured Notes prohibit us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nExchange of the Exchangeable Notes and conversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nSubject to certain contractual restrictions, holders of the Exchangeable Notes and the Convertibles Notes are entitled to exchange or convert, respectively, the Exchangeable Notes or the Convertible Notes for shares of our common stock at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Exchangeable Notes or the Convertible Notes, respectively. The exchange of some or all of the Exchangeable Notes or the conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. If holders of the Exchangeable Notes were to exchange all of the outstanding Exchangeable Notes (not taking into account the potential for capitalization of interest or additional interest or changes to the exchange price), we would need to deliver approximately 6,498,273 shares of our common stock to settle the exchange, which would result in significant dilution to existing stockholders. If holders of the Convertible Notes were to exchange all of the outstanding Convertible Notes, we would need to deliver approximately 682,413 shares of our common stock to settle the conversion, which would result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such exchange or conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe anticipate that there may be fluctuations in our future operating results. Potential causes of future fluctuations in our operating results may include:\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in financial results due to seasonal demands for certain of our products;\nunanticipated potential product liability or patent infringement claims;\nnew or increased competition from generics;\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by competitors;\nchanges in the availability of reimbursement to the patient from third-party payers for our products;\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key strategic alliance agreements;\nthe initiation of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights;\nthe loss of key employees;\nthe results of pre-clinical testing, IND application, and potential clinical trials of some product candidates;\nregulatory changes;\nthe results and timing of regulatory reviews relating to the approval of product candidates;\nthe results of clinical trials conducted by others on products that would compete with our products and product candidates;\nfailure of any of our products or product candidates to achieve commercial success;\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect research and development expenditures;\nfuture sales of our common stock; and\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems resulting from proposed healthcare legislation or otherwise.\nOur stock price is subject to fluctuation, which may cause an investment in our stock to suffer a decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors that are beyond our control. The stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock.\nIf we become subject to unsolicited public proposals from activist stockholders, we may experience significant uncertainty that would likely be disruptive to our business and increase volatility in our stock price.\nPublic companies, particularly those in volatile industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, have been the target of unsolicited public proposals from activist stockholders. The unsolicited and often hostile nature of these public proposals can result in significant uncertainty for current and potential licensors, suppliers, patients, physicians and other constituents, and can cause these parties to change or terminate their business relationships with the targeted company. Companies targeted by these unsolicited proposals from activist stockholders may not be able to attract and retain key personnel as a result of the related uncertainty. In addition, unsolicited proposals can result in stockholder class action lawsuits. The review and consideration of an unsolicited proposal as well as any resulting lawsuits can be a significant distraction for management and employees, and may require the expenditure of significant time, costs and other resources.\nIf we were to receive unsolicited public proposals from activist stockholders, we may encounter all of these risks and, as a result, may be delayed in executing our core strategy. We could be required to spend substantial resources on the evaluation of the proposal as well as the review of other opportunities that never come to fruition. If we were to receive any of these unsolicited public proposals, the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be even more volatile than in the past, and could be subject to wide price fluctuations based on many factors, including uncertainty associated with the proposals.\nWe may become involved in securities or other class action litigation that could divert management's attention and harm our business.\t\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Any securities or other class action litigation asserted against us could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nIf we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate increased revenue will be materially impaired.\nProduct candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are\nsubject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA, the DEA and other regulatory agencies in the United States. Should we acquire or develop a product candidate, the failure to obtain regulatory approval would prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate's safety and efficacy. Securing FDA approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA. Additionally, it is possible that future product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective, or may have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved and the nature of the disease or condition to be treated. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in the regulatory review process for a product application may cause delays in the approval of, or rejection of, an application. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. The FDA may decline to approve one or more of our product candidates for many reasons, including:\ndisagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\nfailure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\nfailure to demonstrate that a product candidate's clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\ndisagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\ninsufficiency of data collected from clinical trials of a product candidate to support the submission and filing of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\ndisapproval of the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\nchanges in approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nIn addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval ultimately obtained may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.\nAny pharmaceutical product for which we currently have marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products.\nAny FDA approved products are subject to continued requirements of and review by the FDA. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even after a product receives FDA approval, that approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, or to requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in administrative and judicial actions such as:\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\nrestrictions on the marketing or distribution of such products;\nrequirements to place additional warnings on the labels for such products;\nrequirements to develop a REMS for such products or, if a REMS is already in place, to incorporate additional requirements under the REMS;\nrequirements to conduct additional post-market studies;\nrestrictions on the manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\nwarning letters;\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\nrecalls;\nfines;\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\nproduct seizure;\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or\nprivate lawsuits alleging harm caused to subjects or patients.\nIn addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising and promotion of marketed products. A pharmaceutical product that receives FDA approval may only be promoted for FDA-approved indications and in accordance with the FDA-approved labeling. We may be subject to enforcement and other liability if we inappropriately promote our products.\nOur sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payors, and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products.\nOur sales of currently marketed products and our ability to commercialize our products effectively depends substantially on the availability of sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including U.S. governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, MCOs and private insurers. All of our promoted products are generally well covered by managed care and private insurance plans. Generally, the status or tier within managed care formularies, which are lists of approved products developed by MCOs, varies but coverage is similar to other products within the same class of drugs. However, the position of any of our branded products that requires a higher patient copayment may make it more difficult to expand the current market share for such product. In some cases, MCOs may require additional evidence that a patient had previously failed another therapy, additional paperwork or prior authorization from the MCO before approving reimbursement for a branded product. Some Medicare Part D plans also cover some or all of our products, but the amount and level of coverage varies from plan to plan. We also participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and submit all of our covered products for inclusion in this program. Coverage of our products under individual state Medicaid plans varies from state to state. Additionally, our covered products are made available under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which is codified as Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B \"ceiling price\" for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs. Details of the 340B program, our reliance on payment and reimbursement from third-party payors, and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement are discussed in the Business section under the heading \"Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement\" in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere have been, there are, and we expect there will continue to be federal and state legislative and administrative proposals that could limit the amount that government health care programs will pay to reimburse the cost of pharmaceutical and biologic products. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, created a new Medicare benefit for prescription drugs. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 significantly reduced reimbursement for drugs under the Medicaid program. More recently, there have been proposals to impose federal rebates on Medicare Part D drugs, requiring federally-mandated rebates on all drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees or on only those drugs dispensed to certain groups of lower income beneficiaries. Legislative or administrative acts that reduce reimbursement or result in us owing additional rebates for our products could adversely impact our business.\nDetails of changes under Health Care Reform, as well as current uncertainties arising as a result of Trump administration and Congressional initiatives, are discussed in the Business section under the heading \"Effects of Legislation on the Pharmaceutical Industry\" in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, private insurers, such as MCOs, may adopt their own reimbursement reductions in response to federal or state legislation. Any reduction in reimbursement for our products could materially harm our results of operations. In addition, we believe that the increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products, which may adversely impact our product sales. Furthermore, when a new product is approved, governmental and private coverage for that product and the amount for which that product will be reimbursed are uncertain. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our product candidates, and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time.\nThe MMA established a voluntary prescription drug benefit, called Part D, which became effective in 2006 for all Medicare beneficiaries. We cannot be certain that our currently marketed products will continue to be, or any of our product candidates still in development will be, included in the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Even if our products are included, the private health plans that administer the Medicare drug benefit can limit the number of prescription drugs that are covered on their formularies in each therapeutic category and class. In addition, private managed care plans and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts. Because many of these same private health plans administer the Medicare drug benefit, they\nhave the ability to influence prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population. In addition, certain states have proposed or adopted various programs under their Medicaid programs to control drug prices, including price constraints, restrictions on access to certain products and bulk purchasing of drugs.\nIf we acquire and market additional products to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a competitive basis to a sufficient patient population. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic trials in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products and product candidates.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\t\t\nWe participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and other governmental pricing programs.\nUnder the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B (we currently do not market any Part B drugs). Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to the CMS the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions.\nHealth Care Reform made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, such as expanding rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid MCOs as well and changing the definition of average manufacturer price. Health Care Reform also increased the minimum Medicaid rebate; changed the calculation of the rebate for certain innovator products that qualify as line extensions of existing drugs; and capped the total rebate amount at 100% of the average manufacturer price. Finally, Health Care Reform requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government.\nOn February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under Health Care Reform, which became effective on April 1, 2016. The issuance of regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program has and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and will be time-consuming to implement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly if CMS challenges the approach we take in our implementation of the final rule.\nFederal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service's 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer's drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge no more than the 340B \"ceiling price\" for the manufacturer's covered outpatient drugs to a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Health Care Reform expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate amount under Health Care Reform and CMS's final regulations implementing those changes also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.\nHealth Care Reform obligates the Secretary of HHS, to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B program. On January 5, 2017, HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. The effective date of the regulation has been delayed until July 1, 2018. Implementation of this final rule and the issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. In the case of our Medicaid pricing data, if we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products under the 340B drug discount program.\nWe are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties. Our failure to submit the required price data on a timely basis could also result in a civil monetary penalty for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.\nCMS and the Office of the Inspector General have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.\nFederal law requires that for a company to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, it also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs, (VA), Federal Supply Schedule, (FSS), pricing program. To participate, we are required to enter into an FSS contract with the VA, under which we must make our innovator \"covered drugs\" available to the \"Big Four\" federal agencies - the VA, the Department of Defense, or DoD, the Public Health Service (PHS), and the Coast Guard - at pricing that is capped pursuant to a statutory federal ceiling price, (FCP), formula set forth in Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA. The FCP is based on a weighted average non-federal average manufacturer price (Non-FAMP), which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and annual basis to the VA. If a company misstates Non-FAMPs or FCPs it must restate these figures. In 2017, the civil monetary penalties for the knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing was $181,071 for each item of false information. This penalty amount has not yet been updated for 2018.\nFSS contracts are federal procurement contracts that include standard government terms and conditions, separate pricing for each product, and extensive disclosure and certification requirements. All items on FSS contracts are subject to a standard FSS contract clause that requires FSS contract price reductions under certain circumstances where pricing is reduced to an agreed \"tracking customer.\" Further, in addition to the \"Big Four\" agencies, all other federal agencies and some non-federal entities are authorized to access FSS contracts. FSS contractors are permitted to charge FSS purchasers other than the Big Four agencies \"negotiated pricing\" for covered drugs that is not capped by the FCP; instead, such pricing is negotiated based on a mandatory disclosure of the contractor's commercial \"most favored customer\" pricing. We offer the same price to the Big 4 and other government agencies on our FSS contract.\nIn addition, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD TRICARE Management Activity, now the Defense Health Agency, to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, each of our covered drugs is listed on a Section 703 Agreement under which we have agreed to pay rebates on covered drug prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies. Companies are required to list their innovator products on Section 703 Agreements in order for those products to be eligible for DoD formulary inclusion. The formula for determining the rebate is established in the regulations and our Section 703 Agreement and is based on the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and the FCP (as described above, these price points are required to be calculated by us under the VHCA).\nOur relationships with customers and payors are subject to applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputation harm, and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, payors and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our products. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers exposes us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulation that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include but are not limited to, the following:\nThe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or arranging for or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term \"remuneration\" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The government can establish a violation of the anti-kickback statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate. Some courts, as well as certain governmental guidance, have interpreted the scope of the anti-kickback statute to cover any situation where one purpose of the remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care program business, even if there are other legitimate reasons for the remuneration. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The anti-kickback statute has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Those exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of the exception or safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal, but the legality of the arrangements will be evaluated based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. However, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or product support and patient assistance programs. We seek to comply with the available statutory exceptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making, or using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have faced enforcement actions under the False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectations that the customers will bill federal programs for the product. Federal enforcement agencies have also showed increased interest in pharmaceutical companies' product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company's marketing the product for unapproved uses. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of $11,181 to $22,363 per false claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary damages and penalties, pharmaceutical manufacturers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts. Companies may be required to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government to avoid exclusion from federal health care programs. Corporate integrity agreements impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. There are also federal criminal statutes that prohibit making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in countries outside of the U.S., such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nThe Open Payments program imposes annual reporting requirements on manufacturers of drugs, devices, or biologics for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program, of certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals made during the preceding calendar year, and any ownership and investment interests held by physicians. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for \"knowing failures\") for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not appropriately reported. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year.\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. Several states require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including providing gifts, meals or other items to certain health care providers. Some states restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Other states and cities require identification or licensing of state representatives. Some states require pharmaceutical manufacturers to implement compliance programs or marketing codes that are consistent with the May 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, and/or the voluntary PhRMA Code.\nWe, as well as many other pharmaceutical companies, sponsor prescription drug coupons and other product support agreements to help ensure that financial need does not limit a patient's access to our products. Co-pay coupon programs and other product and patient assistance programs have received negative publicity related to their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over less costly generics and as a strategy to increase drug prices by shielding patients from those price increases. In recent years, other pharmaceutical manufacturers were named in class action lawsuits that challenged co-pay programs under a variety of federal and state laws. The Office of Inspector General for the HHS has issued additional guidance related to co-pay and patient assistance programs, and other government enforcement agencies have initiated investigations into and pursued enforcement actions related to other manufacturers' product and patient support programs. We cannot be certain whether our product and patient support programs will be named in any future similar lawsuits or become subject to government scrutiny.\nWe attempt to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, utilizing the expertise of outside experts. However, it is possible that governmental authorities might conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our past or present operations, including activities conducted by our sales team or agents, would be found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, imprisonment, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nMany aspects of these laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations and remain subject to change. This increases the risk of potential violations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management's attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA-other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits-we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA- covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. HIPAA generally requires that healthcare providers and other covered entities obtain written authorizations from patients prior to disclosing protected health information of the patient (unless an exception to the authorization requirement applies). If authorization is required and the patient fails to execute an authorization, or the authorization fails to contain all required provisions, then we may not be allowed access to and use of the patient's information and our research efforts could be impaired or delayed. Furthermore, use of protected health information that is provided to us pursuant to a valid patient authorization is subject to the limits set forth in the authorization (e.g., for use in research and in submissions to regulatory authorities for product approvals). In addition, HIPAA does not replace federal, state, international or other laws that may grant individuals even greater privacy protections.\nAlso, the European Parliament has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will become effective on May 25, 2018. This regulation replaces the EU's 1995 data protection directive and shall be the single EU standard across all member states. The GDPR takes a broad view of the types of information that are deemed covered as personal identification information and contains provisions that require businesses to protect such personal data and the privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. The GDPR also regulates the exportation of personal data outside of the EU. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in significant penalties. Many companies, including our company, are assessing the requirements of the GDPR against current business practices and preparing for compliance with this regulation once it becomes effective.", "PERMNO": 84581, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PTXTQ"}
