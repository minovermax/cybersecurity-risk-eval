The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nThe extent to which the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and measures taken in response thereto, including any new and emerging variants of the virus and the efficacy and distribution of vaccines, may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.\nCOVID-19 has spread throughout the world, including the U.S., and has resulted in governmental and other regulatory authorities throughout the U.S. implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus and any variants of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business limitations, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact the consumer, our workforce and operations, as well as the workforce, operations and financial prospects of our customers, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures, such as restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our customers, vendors and suppliers. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including temporary bakery closures and restricting production at certain bakeries, restricting employee travel, developing social distancing plans for our employees, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by governmental and other regulatory authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, vendors and suppliers. We can provide no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to governmental authorities.\nCOVID-19 has had, and will continue to have, a widespread and broad-reaching effect on the economy and our business. Some of the impacts our business has experienced, is experiencing or may experience as a result of COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nWe experienced a favorable shift in sales mix to our branded retail products due to the change in consumer buying patterns as a result of COVID-19 during Fiscal 2021 and 2020, which positively impacted our business operations, including our sales, operating income and cash flows;\n\u2022\nMany of our foodservice customers have periodically closed or restricted operations, which has adversely impacted our revenues from these customers, and has impacted, and could continue to impact, our ability to collect payment from these customers;\n\u2022\nConsumer fears about contracting the disease have altered preferences and spending habits, including significant increases in purchases of fresh and frozen breads during the pendency of quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and other\nshutdowns; and these trends have moderated in recent periods, which could negatively affect our performance in future periods as compared to prior periods if consumers were to purchase fewer products from us;\n\u2022\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, temporary facility closures or partial shutdowns in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate and in response to positive diagnoses for COVID-19 in certain facilities for the safety of our employees;\n\u2022\nOur distribution networks, including our DSD distribution system and our warehouse delivery system, where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers may be disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages;\n\u2022\nDisruptions to our suppliers that supply our ingredients, packaging, and other materials necessary to produce, distribute, and sell our products may affect the ability of our suppliers to fulfill their obligations to us and may cause disruptions to our operations; and\n\u2022\nWe also implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees, which may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.\nThe extent to which the spread of COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak and the emergence of any new or worsening variants, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the distribution and efficacy of vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of COVID-19\u2019s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Any of these events could exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described herein, or in other reports filed with the SEC from time to time, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.\nThe willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Worsening economic conditions or future challenges to economic growth could have a negative impact on consumer demand, which could adversely affect our business. Deterioration of national and global economic conditions could cause consumers to shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or consumers may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns and could result in decreased demand in the foodservice business. This economic uncertainty may increase pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products.\nIn addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, efforts to combat inflation, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us.\nA disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributor partners could negatively affect our business. Such changes could result from litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributor partners, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributor partners. In addition, these changes could result from regulatory developments based on the manner in which the U.S. Department of Labor applies the Fair Labor Standards Act. Any of these developments could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLabor shortages and increased turnover or increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.\nWe have recently experienced labor shortages at some of our bakeries. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers\u2019 health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. A labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our bakeries and bread lines or otherwise operate at full capacity. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nAdditionally, health care, workers\u2019 compensation, postretirement welfare, and pension costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in these costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in benefit plan liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.\nThe costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.\nWe rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to several factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. In addition, failure to comply with local or other laws and regulations could also hurt our reputation. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition or were to suffer damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 53.7% of sales during Fiscal 2021. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam\u2019s Club, accounted for 21.2% of sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.\nWe employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation\u2019s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. In particular, we initiated under Project Centennial, among other things, (i) the integration of acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, (ii) the deployment of new systems and technology, and (iii) an enhanced organizational structure. Our focus on our long-term goals of being consumer-focused and committed to growing our most profitable brands is dependent on our success in achieving our strategic priorities: (i) develop team; (ii) brands focus; (iii) prioritize margins; and (iv) smart M&A activity. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization\u2019s attention from other business issues. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often-complex initiatives. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of our business strategies, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.\nFrom time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on the company\u2019s ability to identify opportunities that help the company meet its strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.\nAcquisitions, including future acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following:\n\u2022\nintegrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions\u037e\n\u2022\nmanaging a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions\u037e\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses\u037e\n\u2022\ncoordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations\u037e\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions\u037e\n\u2022\ncreating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters\u037e and\n\u2022\nexpectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.\nDivestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.\nIn situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, the company\u2019s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.\nDisruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather, inferior product or ingredient supply, or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers, due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, inferior product or ingredient supply, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model, could impair our ability to make, move or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict or political instability, including any escalation of hostility arising out of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events and disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe third-party vendor management processes may not be appropriately designed to reduce risks related to the delivery of goods, supplies and services.\nAs part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, we have entered into agreements with third-party vendors for the delivery of goods, supplies and services, including IT services. If we do not select quality vendors, appropriately review vendor contracts and monitor these vendors\u2019 performance (including their ability to protect our customer, consumer or other confidential data), or if any of these third-parties do not perform according to the terms of the agreements, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such third-party vendors or our reputation could be harmed by any failure to perform.\nTechnology Risks\nWe may be adversely impacted if our IT systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our IT systems. We rely on our IT systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our IT systems (including those provided to us by third-parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.\nIn addition, our IT systems (including those provided to us by third parties) may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.\nWe may experience difficulties in designing and implementing the upgrade of our ERP system.\nWe are in the midst of implementing an upgrade to our ERP system to a more robust platform. The upgrade of the ERP system will be designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance our operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operations of the business. The design and implementation of the upgrade to the ERP system\nrequires an investment of significant personnel and financial resources, including substantial expenditures for outside consultants, system hardware and software in addition to other expenses in connection with the transformation of our financial and operating processes. We may not be able to implement the ERP system upgrade successfully without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties, including potential design defects, miscalculations, testing requirements, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day business operations. If we are unable to implement the ERP system upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIndustry Risks\nIncreases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.\nRaw materials, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast, and water, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand and supply, armed conflict or political instability, including any escalation of hostility arising out of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices\u037e however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging or fixed price arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.\nIn addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing higher-margin products to lower-margin products.\nInflation may adversely affect us by increasing our costs of production, materials, and labor. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the market conditions of the baking industry and the expected raising of interest rate by the United States Federal Reserve, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins, and continued inflationary pressures could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompetition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.\nThe U.S. bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. Substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors\u2019 promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods and periods of high inflation. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.\nProduct removals, damaged product or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. Any such product removal, damaged product or an adverse result in any litigation related to such a product removal or damaged product could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results in future periods, depending on the costs of the product removal from the market, the destruction of product inventory, diversion of management time and attention, contractual and other claims made by customers that we supply, loss of key customers, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.\nDuring fiscal years 2018 through 2021, we have been required, and may be required in future periods, to remove certain of our products from the market should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged, including as a result of inferior ingredients provided by any of our suppliers.\nConsolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe expect consolidations among our retail and foodservice customers to continue. If this trend continues and our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. In addition, these pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.\nInability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, ingredients, and packaging. Similarly, demand for our products could be negatively affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of specific ingredients such as, but not limited to, sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could cause our sales, profitability, and our operating results to suffer.\nOur large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers\u2019 other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by large customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a large customer\u2019s demands, we could lose that customer\u2019s business, which also could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nGovernment regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution, and the safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees, are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusions and legal challenges.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency related to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, and affect our sales.\nCompliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these entities and agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in\nincreased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn and wheat. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules.\nWe may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of climate change, which could impact our production and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nWe are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.\nIncreasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, securities laws, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party\u2019s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.\nExecutive Offices\nThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods.\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nName, Age and Office\nBusiness Experience\nA.Ryals McMullian\nAge 52\nPresident and\nChief Executive Officer\nMr. McMullian was elected CEO in May 2019.
