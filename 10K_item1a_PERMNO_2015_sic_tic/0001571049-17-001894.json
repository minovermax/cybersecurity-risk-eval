{"cik": "816159", "company": "AIR METHODS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur actual operating results and financial condition may differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to, those described below. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u00b7 Our results of operations fluctuate due to weather and other factors associated with the air medical industry.\nAlmost all patient transport revenue and approximately 22% of AMS contract revenue are dependent upon flight volume. Approximately 14% of AMS operating costs incurred during 2016 also varied with the number of hours flown. Poor visibility, high winds, and heavy precipitation can affect the safe operation of aircraft and result in a reduced number of flight hours due to the inability to fly during these conditions. Prolonged periods of adverse weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our operating results due to missed flights or reduced demand for service. Further, prolonged periods of adverse weather conditions may lead referring agencies to incorrectly assume that our bases are out-of-service for weather even though that is not the case, thereby leading to decreases in requests and patient transports. Typically, the months from November through February have lower flight volume due to weather conditions and other factors, resulting in lower patient transport revenue during these months. Cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions for community-based locations open longer than one year were 1,745 lower in 2016 compared to 2015.\nFlight volume related to patient transports also can be affected by the distribution of calls among competitors by local government agencies and the entrance of new competitors into a market. Over the past several years, the increase in the number of air medical helicopters operating within the United States has expanded access to the service in rural and suburban areas but has generally decreased flight volume per aircraft.\nDemand for air medical transportation may also be unfavorably impacted by an overall slow-down in economic activity; decrease in road traffic volume because of unusually high spikes in fuel prices or other factors; cost of the service; loss of confidence in certain markets because of accidents within the air medical industry; or questions regarding the medical necessity for certain transports. In addition, if hospitals within our service areas expand operations to include trauma centers, cardiac catheterization labs, and similar capabilities, the demand for our services may decrease. Conversely, a trend toward hospital consolidation may increase demand for air medical transportation.\nFinally, a number of our bases are located in rural areas throughout the United States and are difficult to staff with appropriate personnel, resulting in lower in-service rates and, therefore, lower flight volume.\n\u00b7 Risks associated with operating our fleet.\nInherent in all helicopter operations are weather and operational risks. In order to minimize these risks, we are constantly reviewing and upgrading aircraft checklists, operating procedures, and crewmember training throughout our entire fleet. Recently the helicopter industry has been focused on technology to reduce the risk of injury to crewmembers and passengers in the event of an accident. We have taken steps to support the development and deployment of crash attenuating passenger seats and self-sealing helicopter fuel tanks to mitigate this risk.\nIn June 2016, the FAA issued a new regulatory framework (14 C.F.R. Part 107) integrating small commercial unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or drones, into the National Airspace System. Commercial drones operated not for hobby or recreation, weighing less than 55 pounds may be legally operated at a maximum altitude of 400 feet above ground level, within the visual line of sight of the operator and in daylight. Operation of drones outside of these regulatory parameters may be permissible with a waiver issued by the FAA. UAS must always yield the right of way to other aircraft.\nEmergency responders, on the ground and in the air, are aware that drones have occasionally not been operated within the requirements of the regulations, and illegal drone operations have the potential to create safety and operational concerns. The Company does not have any documented instances of drones interfering with any of our air medical transport operations, nor are we aware of any documented instances of drone interference with our tourism helicopter operations. However, no assurances can be made that such interference or accidents resulting therefrom will not occur in the future. The FAA is actively working with the drone industry to enhance and require \"sense and avoid\" technology.\n\u00b7 We depend on reimbursement by third-party payers, as well as payments by individuals, which could lead to delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement rate and collection cycle.\nWe respond to calls for air medical transport without pre-screening the third party payer coverage or the creditworthiness of the patient. For our independent service operations, we invoice patients and their insurers directly for services rendered and recognize revenue net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care. Both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix. The provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods. Net reimbursement per patient transport is primarily a function of our payer mix, timely and effective collection efforts, and collection rates. As discussed below, our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes to any of the foregoing factors.\nPayer Mix\nWe are subject to risks related to changes in the mix of privately insured versus uninsured or government-sponsored insured patients that receive our medical services. Medicare and Medicaid rates are less than the cost of providing air medical transportation, and our collection rates may decline as more of the U.S. population becomes eligible for Medicare coverage. The percentage of our patient transports covered by Medicare increased to 35.2% in 2016, compared to 34.4% and 33.3% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. A shift of 1% of our payer mix from insured accounts to either Medicaid or uninsured accounts would result in a decrease of $20.0 million to $21.4 million in pre-tax operating results over one year. A shift of 1% of our payer mix from insured accounts to Medicare would result in a decrease of $17.9 million in pre-tax operating results over one year.\nCollection Efforts\nHealth insurers continue to focus on providers that are out-of-network, such as our Company. As part of their efforts to contain costs, health insurers may unilaterally change their historical reimbursement amounts and billing and reimbursement procedures, including altering their medical necessity criteria. These tactics may result in payment delays, administrative appeals and dispute resolution procedures. As a result of such delays in our cash collections, we assume the financial risk of carrying costs associated with the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the increased potential for unrecoverable accounts. We cannot guarantee that the extended collection period will not result in decreased collection rates, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical payment and collection rates from health insurers.\nCollection Rates\nBoth the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the U.S. economy and the labor participation rate, which impact the number of indigent patients and funding for state-run programs, such as Medicaid. Medicaid reimbursement rates in every jurisdiction have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation. The collection rate may also be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including future changes to the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems and determination of medical necessity and payment rate by third-party payers.\nReimbursement per transport from private patient payers, Medicare, and Medicaid does not increase proportionately with price increases. Certain insurance companies have not increased their reimbursement rates proportionately with recent price increases to the same extent they did with previous price increases. Continued price increases may cause insurance companies to limit coverage for air medical transport, to the extent permitted by law, to amounts less than our historical collection rates. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical collection rates after the implementation of price increases for patient transports.\n\u00b7 If reimbursement rates paid by government healthcare programs or commercial payers are reduced, if we are unable to obtain or maintain favorable contract terms with payers or comply with our payer contract obligations, if insured individuals move to insurance plans with greater coverage exclusions or narrower networks, or if insurance coverage is otherwise restricted, our net operating revenues may decline.\nIn response to increasing federal healthcare expenditures and state budgetary shortfalls, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Some of these changes include reductions to reimbursement levels, which could decrease the amount of money we receive for our services from these programs.\nIn addition, governmental and other third-party payers may use cost containment strategies such as requiring prior authorizations, requiring discounts from providers in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in benefit plans, and implementing alternative payment models. The ability of commercial payers to control costs using these measures may be enhanced by the increasing consolidation of health insurers or insurers otherwise obtaining significant market share in a given market.\nIf we are unable to negotiate increased reimbursement rates, maintain existing rates or other favorable contract terms, effectively respond to payer cost controls, or comply with the terms of our payer contracts, the payments we receive for our services may be reduced or we may become involved in disputes with payers and experience payment delays or denials. In addition, some individuals may move from health insurance plans with higher reimbursement rates for our services and lower co-pays and deductibles to plans that may provide for lower reimbursement of our services along with higher co-pays and deductibles for our services.\n\u00b7 We may be adversely affected by consolidation of health insurers.\nConsolidation of insurance payers could place pressure on flight demand and increase the integrated entities\u2019 leverage to apply discounts to reimbursement rates. Our ability to negotiate prices and favorable contract terms with health insurers in certain markets may be negatively affected by consolidation efforts. We cannot predict whether we will be able to respond effectively to the impact of increased consolidation by health insurers.\n\u00b7 If we experience deterioration in the collectibility of patient responsibility accounts, our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity could be adversely affected.\nAs discussed in more detail in the Government Regulation section of this Form 10-K, the impact of PPACA, combined with the growing financial and economic pressures on the healthcare industry, have resulted in challenges to current and future reimbursement trends. A primary collection risk relates to outstanding patient balances for which the primary insurance payer has paid some but not all of the outstanding balance, with the remaining outstanding balance owed by the patient. Collections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. Further, we may be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures, including health savings accounts and high-deductible plans, that shift greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and higher copayment and deductible amounts. Our ability to collect patient responsibility accounts may be limited by statutory, regulatory and investigatory initiatives, including private lawsuits directed at emergency air ambulance charges and collection practices for uninsured and underinsured patients. Some federal and state legislators have proposed legislation that would limit our ability to balance bill patients. Significant changes in payer mix, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage or applicable laws may affect our collection of accounts receivable and are considered in our estimates of accounts receivable collectibility. If we experience further deterioration in collectibility of patient responsibility accounts and patient responsibility balances continue to increase, our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 Providers in the health care industry have been the subject of federal and state investigations, and we may become subject to investigations in the future.\nState and federal statutes impose substantial penalties-including civil and criminal fines, exclusion from participation in government programs, and imprisonment-on entities or individuals (including any individual corporate officers or physicians deemed responsible) that fraudulently or wrongfully bill governmental or other third-party payers for services. Third party payers typically have differing and complex billing and documentation requirements that we must meet in order to receive reimbursement for our services. We believe that audits, inquiries, and investigations from government agencies will continue to occur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including as a result of our arrangements with hospitals and health care providers and of our UR Division contracts. In addition, we may be subject to increased audits from private payers to the extent they encounter pricing pressures related to health care reform. This could result in substantial defense costs to us and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. Such pending or future audits, inquiries, or investigations, or the public disclosure of such matters, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of PPACA, and our business may be adversely affected if PPACA is repealed entirely or if provisions benefitting our operations are significantly modified as a result of the 2016 federal elections.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to effect major change in the healthcare system, including changes that increased access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, PPACA, affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. It includes, among other provisions, Medicare payment and delivery reforms aimed at containing costs, rewarding quality, and improving outcomes through coordinated care arrangements. PPACA also includes provisions that expand the government\u2019s ability to combat health care program fraud, abuse, and waste. To the extent uninsured patients obtain any type of insurance coverage, our collection rates may increase. To the extent patients currently covered by private insurance move to government-run programs or to public or private insurance exchanges, collection rates may decrease.\nThe 2016 federal election, which resulted in the election of a Republican president and Republican control of both houses of Congress, increased the likelihood of repeal of PPACA or significant changes to PPACA, its implementation or its interpretation. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how PPACA will be changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of alternative provisions, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants. For example, the president has signed an executive order that directs federal agencies to minimize \u201ceconomic and regulatory burdens\u201d of PPACA, but it is unclear how this will be implemented. Further, Congress could eliminate or alter provisions that are beneficial to us while leaving in place provisions that impose costs on us or otherwise decrease our revenues. For example, emergency services are currently included among the EHB that individual and small group plans must cover, but this provision could be repealed or amended, or the benchmark plans defining the scope of EHBs could change. Government efforts to repeal or change PPACA may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. We cannot predict whether we will be able to modify certain aspects of our operations to offset any potential adverse consequences from PPACA or other federal or state health reform initiatives.\nThe U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have also introduced and, in some cases, passed legislation that (i) prevents an emergency air ambulance provider from collecting any unpaid balance from the patient; and (ii) seeks to define sufficient reimbursement rates as the equivalent of the amounts paid by Medicare or another rate that is less than usual and customary rates. Our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected by such legislation.\n\u00b7 Potential federal government legislation to permit states to regulate the price of air ambulance transport and effectively exempt the air ambulance industry from the Airline Deregulation Act could impact operations.\nDuring 2016, an amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016 was introduced in the Senate to exempt air ambulance services from the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA), proposing to allow states to decide whether to create rules regarding air ambulance rates and services. Currently under the ADA, states are prohibited from enacting law that affects an air carrier's rates, routes, or services. Though the amendment failed, the Senate may consider similar legislation in the future. Pre-emption of the ADA with respect to air ambulance services may result in a patchwork of restrictions on air ambulance transports across state lines, reduced reimbursement, and likely other unintended consequences. We have worked proactively with the U.S. Department of Transportation to address this federal pre-emption issue.\n\u00b7 If we are not able to find suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate completed acquisitions into our current operations, we may not be able to profitably grow or operate our company.\nWe expect to continue to seek opportunities to grow through attractive acquisitions. However, acquisitions present a number of challenges, including significant effort to assimilate operations, financial and accounting practices and information systems and to integrate key personnel from the acquired business. To manage our growth effectively, we must expand and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, information systems, and procedures. Acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management's attention from day-to-day operations. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions, profitability may suffer due to acquisition-related costs or unanticipated liabilities, and our stock price may decrease if the financial markets consider any acquisition to be inappropriately priced.\n\u00b7 Failure to achieve expected benefits of the Tri-State Careflight L.L.C. (TSCF) acquisition and to integrate TSCF\u2019s operations with ours could adversely affect us.\nWe are in the process of eliminating overlapping operations and centralizing many support functions to achieve synergies from the acquisition of TSCF. However, we cannot be certain whether, and to what extent, additional efficiencies and cost savings in connection with the TSCF transaction will be achieved in the future. Such integration may be complex and the failure to do so efficiently and effectively may negatively affect earnings.\n\u00b7 Tourism operations may be adversely impacted by weather, global economic conditions and reliance on third-party booking agencies.\nAll tourism revenue is dependent upon flight volume but approximately 53% of our tourism operating expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016, varied with the number of hours flown. Typically, flight volume for Sundance\u2019s operations tends to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the length of daylight hours and traditional vacation schedules. BHH does not experience significant seasonal variation in passenger volume. Because international travelers account for a significant number of tourism customers, flight volume may also be impacted by global economic conditions and currency exchange rates. In addition, approximately 26% of Sundance\u2019s bookings originate with one online booking company. Termination of this contract may negatively impact the number of reservations booked for Sundance.\n\u00b7 Our business relies extensively on two key third-party suppliers for aircraft and aircraft parts. Failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in our relationships with these suppliers or their provision of services to us, could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe currently obtain a substantial portion of our helicopter spare parts and components from Airbus and Bell and maintain supply arrangements with other parties for our engine and related dynamic components. As of December 31, 2016, Airbus aircraft compose 75% of our helicopter fleet while Bell aircraft constitute 18%. Based upon the manufacturing capabilities and industry contacts of Airbus, Bell, and other suppliers, we believe we will not be subject to material interruptions or delays in obtaining aircraft parts and components but do not have an alternative source of supply for Airbus, Bell, and certain other aircraft parts. Failure or significant delay by these vendors in providing necessary parts could, in the absence of alternative sources of supply, have a material adverse effect on us. Increases in spare parts prices tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production. The ability to pass on price increases may be limited by reimbursement rates established by Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance providers and by other market considerations, including competitive pressures within our tourism operations.\n\u00b7 We are the subject of various legal proceedings that, if resolved unfavorably, could have an adverse effect on us, and we may be subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown.\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings and other related matters. In addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of our legal proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\n\u00b7 The market for sale of secondary used aircraft is limited and we may not realize the full value of our long-lived assets, resulting in impairment charges or losses upon disposition.\nWe are dependent upon the secondary used aircraft market to dispose of older models of aircraft. In the past several years, the demand for used aircraft has diminished. The decline in the oil and gas exploration industry has also increased the number of used aircraft on the market. If we are unable to dispose of our older aircraft, our aircraft carrying costs may increase above requirements for our current operations, or we may accept lower selling prices, resulting in losses on disposition or reduced gains. The types of aircraft targeted for disposition usually have lower carrying costs than new aircraft. We have also been able to convert some aircraft to spare parts to support the operation of our existing fleet, rather than seeking to sell the aircraft to a third party.\n\u00b7 Union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions could adversely affect our operations and result in increased cost of operations.\nThe CBA with our AMS pilots expired on December 31, 2016, and we are currently in the process of negotiating a new CBA. Historically, the CBA has included procedures for training, addressing grievances, discipline and discharge, among other matters, and defined vacation, holiday, sick, health insurance, and other employee benefits. Tourism pilots are not currently subject to the CBA. Union personnel have actively attempted to organize other employee groups in the past, and these groups may elect to be represented by unions in the future. If we are unable to reach agreement with the collective bargaining unit representing the AMS pilots in future negotiations regarding CBA terms or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act or other applicable laws. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business.\n\u00b7 Our AMS and Tourism operations are highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our businesses.\nWe face significant competition from national and regional air medical transportation providers for contracts with hospitals and other health care institutions. A number of hospitals and health care institutions have also elected to operate their own Part 135 Certificate, thereby eliminating the need for a third party to provide air medical transportation services. In addition, we face competition from smaller regional carriers and alternative air ambulance providers such as sheriff departments for patient transports. In some cases, advanced life support and critical care transport ground ambulance providers may also be competing for the same transports. Further, the construction of additional hospitals and medical treatment centers in currently unserved areas would likely increase the ability of ground-based ambulances to provide services currently provided by air medical providers. Therefore, the construction of additional medical facilities in our markets could, under certain circumstances, reduce demand for certain of our services. Air medical operators generally compete on the basis of price, safety record, accident prevention and training, clinical quality, and the medical capability of the aircraft. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully for new or renewing AMS contracts, preferred provider agreements, or market share in the future.\nOur Tourism Division faces competition from several larger aerial tourism operators in the Grand Canyon market and a number of smaller operators in both the Grand Canyon and Hawaiian Island markets. We also compete against other tourism offerings and experiences. Aerial tourism operators generally compete on the basis of price, experience offering, and customer satisfaction. Strong brand recognition and proximity to popular vacation sights also help to distinguish one competitor over another. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully for market share in the future.\n\u00b7 Sundance maintains a strategic partnership, the loss of which would materially disrupt its operations and adversely impact its financial position.\nSundance maintains a contract with the Hualapai Tribe to allow flights over and landings on tribal land adjoining Grand Canyon National Park. The relationship between Sundance and the Hualapai has been in place for over 25 years, and the current contract is effective through March 2017. Negotiations on renewal of the contract commenced in the first quarter of 2017. The contract results in mutual benefit, providing flights for Sundance and additional tourist traffic at Hualapai attractions. Failure to continue to successfully renew the contract with the Hualapai could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations for the Tourism Division.\n\u00b7 Future changes in airport or heliports access could limit tourism flight volume.\nWe currently operate our aerial tours out of several airports and heliports located in Las Vegas and the Hawaiian Islands. These facilities are strategically located in close proximity to tourist traffic. If these airports or heliports were to restrict access for rotor wing operations, our tourism flight volume may be significantly adversely impacted. In addition, Hawaii has a limited number of hangar and helipad sites, which may limit the ability of other competitors to enter the market but also our ability to expand operations to other locations within the state.\n\u00b7 Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nHazards are inherent in the aviation industry and may result in loss of life and property, thereby exposing us to potentially substantial liability claims arising from the operation of aircraft. We may also be sued in connection with medical malpractice claims arising from events occurring during or relating to medical flights. Under most AMS operating agreements, our customers have agreed to indemnify us against liability arising from medical malpractice claims and to maintain insurance covering such liability, but there can be no assurance that a hospital will not challenge the indemnification rights or will have sufficient assets or insurance coverage to fulfill its indemnity obligations. In independent model operations, our personnel perform medical procedures on transported patients, which may expose us directly to medical malpractice claims. We maintain general liability aviation insurance, aviation product liability coverage, and medical malpractice insurance, and believe our level of coverage is customary in the industry and adequate to protect against claims. However, there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that present levels of coverage will be available in the future at reasonable cost. A limited number of hull and liability insurance underwriters provide coverage for air medical and tourism operators. Insurance underwriters are required by various federal and state regulations to maintain minimum levels of reserves for known and expected claims. However, there can be no assurance that underwriters have established adequate reserves to fund existing and future claims. The number of air medical or tourism accidents, as well as the number of insured losses within other helicopter operations and the commercial airline industry, and the impact of general economic conditions on underwriters may result in increases in premiums above the rate of inflation. Approximately 28% of any increases in hull and liability insurance for our AMS operations may be passed through to our AMS contract customers according to contract terms.\n\u00b7 We could experience adverse publicity, harm to our brand, reduced requests or bookings, and potential tort liability as a result of an accident or incident involving our aircraft, which may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAn accident, catastrophe, or incident involving an aircraft that we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations if such accident or incident created a public perception that our operations are not safe or reliable or that our operations are less safe or reliable than other air medical or tourism operators. Additionally, accidents involving any aircraft operated by another operator could create a negative public perception of our industry generally. Such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity, cause harm to our brand, and reduce requests or bookings for AMS and Tourism operations, respectively. In addition, any such accident or incident could expose us to significant tort liability. Although we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type we believe to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident, if our liability exceeds the applicable policy limits, we could incur substantial losses from an accident, catastrophe, or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\u00b7 Volatility in fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on our cost of operations and profitability.\nFuel accounted for 2.7% of total AMS operating expenses and 7.1% of Tourism operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Both the cost and availability of fuel are influenced by many economic and geopolitical factors and events occurring in oil-producing countries throughout the world. The price per barrel of oil has fluctuated significantly over the past several years. We cannot predict the future cost and availability of fuel or the impact of disruptions in oil supplies or refinery production from refinery outages as well as natural disasters. The unavailability of adequate fuel supplies or higher fuel prices could have an adverse effect on our cost of operations and profitability. Generally, our AMS hospital contract customers pay for all fuel consumed in medical flights. However, our ability to pass on increased fuel costs for community-based operations may be limited by reimbursement rates established by Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance providers. Economic and competitive conditions may also limit our ability to fully recover increased fuel costs for community-based operations and tourism operations. Since 2009, we have carried financial derivative agreements to protect against increases in the cost of Gulf Coast jet fuel. During 2016, fuel derivatives covered the majority of our fuel consumption, and in the first quarter of 2017, we entered into fuel derivatives to protect the majority of our anticipated fuel consumption for 2017 against upward movements in price exceeding 20%.\n\u00b7 If we are unable to effectively compete for the employees needed to run our operations, our business would be adversely affected.\nAn important aspect of our operations is the ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation, nursing, and other technical skills. In addition, hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics. Employees who meet these standards are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future. If we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of these employees, the ability to maintain and grow the business could be negatively impacted. A limited supply of qualified applicants may also contribute to wage increases which outpace the rate of inflation.\n\u00b7 Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operational flexibility.\nOur senior credit facility contains restrictive financial and operating covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to engage in various corporate transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, repurchases of our common stock, and payment of future cash dividends. These covenants may restrict future growth through the limitation on acquisitions and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business plan. Failure to comply with the covenants defined in the agreement or to maintain the required financial ratios could result in an event of default and accelerate payment of the principal balances due under the senior credit facility. Given factors beyond our control, such as interruptions in operations from unusual weather patterns or decreases in flight volume due to overall economic conditions not included in current projections, there can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with financial covenants in the future, or that, in the event of non-compliance, we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders, or that to obtain such waivers, we will not be required to pay lenders significant cash or equity compensation.\n\u00b7 Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of our information technology networks and systems, to process, transmit and store electronic information, to communicate with our aircraft, to manage or support a variety of our other business operations, transactions and processes, and to maintain various records, which may include personally identifiable information of customers, employees or other third parties. Additionally, this information may include payment and medical information that is subject to and regulated by privacy laws, as described further elsewhere in this report. We have undertaken measures to protect the safety and security of our information technology networks and systems and the data maintained within those systems, and on an annual basis, we test the adequacy of our security and disaster recovery measures. As part of our efforts, we may be required to expend significant capital to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches, including unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware to our systems. We are unable to assure that our security efforts and measures will prevent or detect unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data, account takeovers, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events, whether caused by mechanical failures, human error, fraud, malice, sabotage or otherwise. The frequency, scope and sophistication of cyber-attacks continue to grow, which increases the possibility that our security measures will be unable to prevent our systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information (including medical information). Any failure of our information or communications systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\n\u00b7 Extensive laws and government regulation could increase our operating costs, restrict our ability to conduct our business or require us to make significant changes to our operations, or subject us to significant penalties.\nThe air medical transportation services and products and aerial tourism industries are governed by laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels. Regulation by governmental agencies, particularly the FAA and HHS, imposes significant compliance costs on us. Evolving interpretations or enforcement of these laws could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes to our equipment, personnel, services, or other operations. Changes in laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our cost of operations or revenue from flight operations. Further, failure to comply with these extensive laws and regulations or the terms or conditions may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations or corrective actions, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations.\nBy way of example and not limitation, we currently have flyover rights granted by the United States National Park Service to conduct aerial tours over two major national parks in Hawaii, along with some smaller national parks. Regulatory changes or environmental pressures could result in changes to the number of flyover rights issued to aerial tourism operators by the Park Service or to the requirements for noise-diminishing technology on our aircraft. Additional restrictions on flyover rights or changes in technology requirements could have a significant adverse impact on our flight volume or cost of operations for our Tourism Division.\n\u00b7 We have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Such indebtedness could also adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities.\nWe are obligated under debt facilities and capital lease arrangements totaling $891.5 million at December 31, 2016, and operating lease obligations which total $52.7 million over the remaining terms of the leases. If we fail to meet our payment obligations or otherwise default under the agreements governing indebtedness or lease obligations, the lenders under those agreements will have the right to accelerate the indebtedness and exercise other rights and remedies against us. These rights and remedies include the rights to repossess and foreclose upon the assets that serve as collateral, initiate judicial foreclosure against us, petition a court to appoint a receiver for us, and initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against us. If lenders exercise their rights and remedies, our assets may not be sufficient to repay outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations, and there may be no assets remaining after payment of indebtedness and lease obligations to provide a return on common stock.\nOur senior credit facility provides for up to $650 million in term loans and a revolving line of credit of $125 million, all of which bear interest at rates based on either prime, federal funds, or LIBOR rates. As of December 31, 2016, we had $440.3 million in term loans outstanding and no balance against the revolving line of credit. The weighted average interest rate in effect for all borrowings under the senior credit facility during 2016 was 2.5%. Increases in the indices on which our interest rates are based will increase our interest expense.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which requires significant interest and principal payments. As a result, we may experience (i) increased vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; (ii) limited ability to retain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; (iii) increased costs of borrowing; and (iv) limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate.\n\u00b7 A currently pending proxy contest, and any other actions of activist stockholders, could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nOn February 15, 2017, Voce Capital Management, LLC (Voce), a stockholder that, together with its affiliates, held 3.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock, provided our Board of Directors with written notice, and issued a public press release to our stockholders, announcing its intent to nominate four director candidates for election as Class II directors to our Board of Directors at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and to solicit proxies in support of its nominees.\nThis pending proxy contest, or other activist stockholders activities that may ensue, may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. We have retained the services of various professional advisers (including legal, financial, and communications), the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of these and any similar activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, adversely impact our relationships with key business partners and affect the market price and volatility of our common stock. Moreover, if individuals are elected to our Board of Directors with a specific agenda, our ability to effectively and timely implement our current initiatives, retain and attract experienced executives and employees, implement our business strategy and create stockholder value may be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to controls over information technology access and the associated information produced by the Company. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The control deficiencies described in Item 9A did not result in any misstatements in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - An Integrated Framework (2013). We are actively engaged in developing remediation plans designed to address these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, our consolidated financial statements reported in the future may contain material misstatements or omissions. Further, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control that are not presently known by management are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements included in this report and those reported in the future may contain material misstatements or omissions, which could result in regulatory scrutiny, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial results, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or the trading price of our stock.\n\u00b7 Our certificate of incorporation does not currently restrict a foreign person from owning greater than 25% of our common stock. In the event a foreign person acquired greater than 25% of our common stock, our air operating certificate may be revoked.\nFederal law requires that United States air carriers be citizens of the United States. For a corporation to qualify as a United States citizen, the president and at least two-thirds of directors and other managing officers of the corporation must be United States citizens and at least 75% of the voting interest of the corporation must be owned or controlled by United States citizens. If we are unable to satisfy these requirements, operating authority from the Department of Transportation may be revoked. As of December 31, 2016, we are not aware of any foreign person who holds more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock. Our certificate of incorporation does not currently contain foreign ownership restrictions. Because we are unable to control the ownership and transfer of our stock, we are unable to assure that we can remain in compliance with these requirements in the future. Because we are unable to control the transfer of our stock, we are unable to assure that we can remain in compliance with these requirements in the future.", "PERMNO": 11641, "SIC": 4522, "TIC": "AIRM"}
