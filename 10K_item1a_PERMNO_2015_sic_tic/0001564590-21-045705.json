Risk Factors\nMany of the factors that affect UNIFI\u2019s business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. You should consider all such risks in evaluating UNIFI or making any investment decision involving UNIFI.\nStrategic Risks\nUNIFI faces intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign yarn producers and importers of foreign-sourced fabric, apparel and other textile products. Because UNIFI and the supply chains in which UNIFI conducts its business do not typically operate on the basis of long-term contracts with textile customers or brand partners, these competitive factors could cause UNIFI\u2019s customers or brand partners to shift rapidly to other producers.\nUNIFI competes not only against domestic and foreign yarn producers, but also against importers of foreign-sourced fabric, apparel and other textile products into the U.S. and other countries in which UNIFI does business, particularly in Brazil with respect to commodity yarn products. The primary competitive factors in the textile industry include price, quality, product styling, performance attributes and differentiation, brand reputation, flexibility and location of production and finishing, delivery time and customer service. The needs of certain customers and brand partners and the characteristics of particular products determine the relative importance of these various factors. A large number of UNIFI\u2019s foreign competitors have significant competitive advantages that may include lower labor and raw material costs, production facilities in locations outside UNIFI\u2019s existing supply chain, government subsidies and favorable foreign currency exchange rates against the USD. If any of these advantages increase, if new and/or larger competitors emerge in the future or if UNIFI\u2019s brand reputation is detrimentally impacted, UNIFI\u2019s products could become less competitive, and its sales and profits may decrease as a result. In particular, devaluation of the Chinese currency against the USD could result in UNIFI\u2019s products becoming less competitive from a pricing standpoint and/or could result in the NACA region losing market share to Chinese imports, thereby adversely impacting UNIFI\u2019s sales and profits. While these foreign competitors have traditionally focused on commodity production, they are now increasingly focused on value-added products. UNIFI may not be able to continue to compete effectively with foreign-made textile and apparel products, which would materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, to maximize their own supply chain efficiency, customers and brand partners sometimes request that UNIFI\u2019s products be produced and sourced from specific geographic locations that are in close proximity to the customer\u2019s fabric mills or that have other desirable attributes from the customer\u2019s perspective. These locations are sometimes situated outside the footprint of UNIFI\u2019s existing global supply chain. If UNIFI is unable to move production based on customer requests or other shifts in regional demand, we may lose sales and experience an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA significant portion of our sales is dependent upon demand from a few large brand partners.\nUNIFI\u2019s strategy involves the sale of products and solutions to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers (UNIFI\u2019s direct customers) that produce yarn and/or fabric for brands and retailers in the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end-use markets (UNIFI\u2019s indirect customers). We refer to these indirect customers as \u201cbrand partners.\u201d Although we generally do not derive revenue directly from our brand partners, sales volumes to our direct customers are linked with demand from our brand partners because our direct sales generally form a part of our brand partners\u2019 supply chains. A significant portion of our overall sales is tied to ongoing programs for a small number of brand partners. Our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest brand partners and on our success in diversifying our products and our indirect customer base. Because we typically do not operate on the basis of long-term contracts, our customers and brand partners can cease incorporating our products into their own with little notice to us and with little or no penalty. The loss of a large brand partner, and the failure to add new customers to replace the corresponding lost sales, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant price volatility of UNIFI\u2019s raw materials and rising energy costs may result in increased production costs. UNIFI attempts to pass such increases in production costs on to its customers through responsive price increases. However, any such price increases are effective only after a time lag that may span one or more quarters, during which UNIFI and its margins are negatively affected.\nPetroleum-based chemicals and recycled plastic bottles comprise a significant portion of UNIFI\u2019s raw materials. The prices for these products and related energy costs are volatile and dependent on global supply and demand dynamics, including geo-political risks. While UNIFI enters into raw material supply agreements from time to time, these agreements typically provide index pricing based on quoted market prices. Therefore, supply agreements provide only limited protection against price volatility. UNIFI attempts to pass on to its customers increases in raw material costs, but at times it cannot. When it can, there is typically a time lag that adversely affects UNIFI and its margins during one or more quarters. Certain customers are subject to an index-based pricing model in which UNIFI\u2019s prices are adjusted based on the change in the cost of certain raw materials in the prior quarter. Pricing adjustments for other customers must be negotiated independently. In ordinary market conditions in which raw material price increases have stabilized and sales volumes are consistent with traditional levels, UNIFI has historically been successful in implementing price adjustments within one to two fiscal quarters of the raw material price increase for its index priced customers and within two fiscal quarters of the raw material price increase for its non-index priced customers. UNIFI has lost in the past (and expects that it may lose in the future) customers to its competitors as a result of price increases. In addition, competitors may be able to obtain raw materials at a lower cost due to market regulations that favor local producers in certain foreign locations where UNIFI operates, and certain other market regulations that favor UNIFI over other producers may be amended or repealed. Additionally, inflation can have a long-term impact by increasing the costs of materials, labor and/or energy, any of which costs may adversely impact UNIFI\u2019s ability to maintain satisfactory margins. If UNIFI is not able to pass on such cost increases to customers in a timely manner (or if it loses a large number of customers to competitors as a result of price increases), the result could be material and adverse to its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDepending on the price volatility of petroleum-based inputs, recycled bottles and other raw materials, the price gap between virgin chip and recycled chip could make virgin raw materials more cost-effective than recycled raw materials, which could result in an adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s ability to sell its REPREVE\u00ae brand recycled products profitably.\nThe success of UNIFI\u2019s business is tied to the strength and reputation of its brands. If the reputation of one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\nUNIFI has invested heavily in branding and marketing initiatives, and certain of our brands, particularly our REPREVE\u00ae brand, have widespread recognition. Our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of a brand can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers. Our financial results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a product recall, product-related litigation, the sale of counterfeit products or other circumstances that tarnish the qualities and values represented by our brands. Part of our strategy also includes the license of our trademarks to brand partners, customers, independent contractors and other third parties. For example, we license our REPREVE\u00ae trademarks to brand partners that feature this trademark on their marketing materials as part of a co-branded environmental sustainability product narrative. Although we make concerted efforts to protect our brands through quality control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees, there is a risk that some licensees might not be in full compliance with those mechanisms and obligations. If the reputation of one or more of our brands is significantly eroded, it could adversely affect our sales, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nUNIFI\u2019s future success will depend in part on its ability to protect and preserve its intellectual property rights, and UNIFI\u2019s inability to enforce these rights could cause it to lose sales, reduce any competitive advantage it has developed or otherwise harm its business.\nUNIFI\u2019s future success depends in part on its ability to protect and preserve its rights in the trademarks and other intellectual property it owns or licenses, including its proprietary know-how, methods and processes. UNIFI relies on the trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect its intellectual property rights. However, UNIFI may be unable to prevent third parties, employees or contractors from using its intellectual property without authorization, breaching nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements, or independently developing technology that is similar to UNIFI\u2019s. The use of UNIFI\u2019s intellectual property by others without authorization may cause it to lose sales, reduce any competitive advantage UNIFI has developed or otherwise harm its business.\nFinancial Risks\nUNIFI has significant foreign operations, and its consolidated results of operations and business may be adversely affected by the risks associated with doing business in foreign locations, including the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nUNIFI has operations in Brazil, China, Colombia, El Salvador and Turkey and participates in joint ventures located in Israel. In addition, to help service its customers, UNIFI from time to time engages with third-party independent contractors to provide sales and distribution, manufacturing and other operational and administrative support services in locations around the world. UNIFI serves customers throughout the Americas and Asia, as well as various countries in Europe. UNIFI\u2019s foreign operations are subject to certain political, tax, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by its domestic operations that can materially impact UNIFI\u2019s supply chains or other aspects of its foreign operations. The risks of international operations include trade barriers, duties, exchange controls, national and regional labor strikes, social and political unrest, general economic risks, compliance with a variety of foreign laws (including tax laws), the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, taxes on distributions or deemed distributions to UNIFI or any of its U.S. subsidiaries, maintenance of minimum capital requirements and import and export controls. UNIFI\u2019s consolidated results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant adverse development with respect to any of these risks.\nThrough its foreign operations, UNIFI is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will impact period-to-period comparisons of UNIFI\u2019s reported results. Additionally, UNIFI operates in countries with foreign exchange controls. These controls may limit UNIFI\u2019s ability to transfer funds from its international operations and joint ventures or otherwise to convert local currencies into USDs. These limitations could adversely affect UNIFI\u2019s ability to access cash from its foreign operations.\nIn addition, due to its foreign operations, a risk exists that UNIFI\u2019s employees, contractors or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to the Company, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations of other countries in which we do business. UNIFI maintains policies prohibiting these practices, but it remains subject to the risk that one or more of its employees, contractors or agents, specifically ones based in or from countries where such practices are customary, will engage in business practices in violation of these laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if in breach of UNIFI\u2019s policies, could adversely affect its business or financial performance.\nUNIFI may be subject to greater tax liabilities.\nUNIFI is subject to income tax and other taxes in the U.S. and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. UNIFI\u2019s domestic and foreign income tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed. Additionally, the amount of taxes paid is subject to UNIFI\u2019s interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development could have an adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Significant judgment, knowledge and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.\nUNIFI requires cash to service its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures and strategic initiatives, and its ability to generate sufficient cash for those purposes depends on many factors beyond its control.\nUNIFI\u2019s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility. UNIFI\u2019s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and strategic initiatives will depend on its ability to generate future cash flows from operations. This ability, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond UNIFI\u2019s control. The business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to UNIFI in amounts sufficient, to enable UNIFI to pay its indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Any such development would have a material adverse effect on UNIFI.\nOperational Risks\nUNIFI depends on limited sources for certain of its raw materials, and interruptions in supply could increase its costs of production, cause production inefficiencies or lead to a halt in production.\nUNIFI depends on a limited number of third parties for certain raw material supplies, such as POY and Chip. Although alternative sources of raw materials exist, UNIFI may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of such materials on acceptable terms, or at all, from other sources. UNIFI is dependent on USMCA/NAFTA, CAFTA-DR and Berry Amendment qualified suppliers of raw materials for the production of Compliant Yarns. These suppliers are also at risk with their raw material supply chains. Any significant disruption or curtailment in the supply of any of its raw materials could cause UNIFI to reduce or cease its production for an extended period, or require UNIFI to increase its pricing, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA disruption at one of our facilities could harm our business and result in significant losses, lead to a decline in sales and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations and business could be disrupted by natural disasters, industrial accidents, power or water shortages, extreme weather conditions, pandemics and other man-made disasters or catastrophic events. We carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks, with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations. However, the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, lead to a decline in sales and increase our costs and expenses. Any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches.\nAttempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become increasingly more sophisticated over time. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We carry data protection liability insurance against cyber attacks, with limits we deem adequate for the reimbursement for damage to our computers, equipment and networks and resulting disruption of our operations. Any disruption from a cyber attack could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers. We have been a target of cybersecurity attacks in the past and, while such attacks have not resulted in a material impact on our operations, business or customer relationships, such attacks could in the future.\nThe theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any cybersecurity breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers\u2019 or brand partners\u2019 confidential information, we may incur a liability as a result. In addition, the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results.\nA decline or change in general economic conditions, political conditions, and/or levels of consumer spending, could cause a decline in demand for textile products, including UNIFI\u2019s products.\nUNIFI\u2019s products are used in the production of fabric primarily for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end-use markets. Demand for furniture and other durable goods is often affected significantly by economic conditions that have global or regional industry-wide consequences. Demand for a number of categories of apparel also tends to be tied to economic cycles and customer preferences that affect the textile industry in general. Demand for textile products, therefore, tends to vary with the business cycles of the U.S. and other economies, as well as changes in global trade flows, and economic and political conditions. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact UNIFI\u2019s results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including facilities and equipment, amortizable intangible assets and equity affiliates.\nChanges in consumer spending, customer preferences, fashion trends and end uses for UNIFI\u2019s products could weaken UNIFI\u2019s competitive position and cause UNIFI\u2019s products to become less competitive, and its sales and profits may decrease as a result. Additionally, the end-consumer retail and apparel markets may continue to experience difficult conditions characterized by reduced retail traffic and growth in online sales channels, which may cause bankruptcies, store closures and other transformations for traditional retail enterprises, which could have an adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business and financial condition.\nHistoric trends indicate weakening performance in the nylon sector on a global basis. If further declines are significant in any one year or the cumulative decline over a number of years is significant, the impact could have a material adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nGeneral Risks\nUnfavorable changes in trade policies and/or violations of existing trade policies could weaken UNIFI\u2019s competitive position significantly and have a material adverse effect on its business.\nA number of markets within the textile industry in which UNIFI sells its products, particularly the apparel, hosiery and home furnishings markets, are subject to intense foreign competition. Other markets within the textile industry in which UNIFI sells its products may in the future become subject to more intense foreign competition. There are currently a number of trade regulations and duties in place to protect the U.S. textile industry against competition from low-priced foreign producers, such as those in China, India and Vietnam. Political and policy-driven influences are subjecting international trade regulations to significant volatility. Future changes in such trade regulations or duties may make the price of UNIFI\u2019s products less attractive than the goods of its competitors or the finished products of a competitor in the supply chain, which could have a material adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such changes in U.S. import duties might also result in increased indirect costs on items imported to support UNIFI\u2019s domestic operations and/or countervailing or responsive changes applicable to exports of our products outside the U.S.\nAccording to industry experts and trade associations, there has been a significant amount of illegal transshipments of apparel products into the U.S. and into certain other countries in the NACA region in which UNIFI competes. Illegal transshipment involves circumventing duties by falsely claiming that textiles and apparel are products of a particular country of origin (or include yarn of a particular country of origin) to avoid paying higher duties or to receive benefits from regional free trade agreements, such as USMCA/NAFTA and CAFTA-DR. If illegal transshipments are not monitored, and if enforcement is not effective to limit them, these shipments could have a material adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn order to compete effectively, we must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations.\nIn order to compete effectively, we must attract and retain qualified employees. Our future operating results and success depend on keeping key personnel and management and also expanding our technical, sales and marketing, innovation and administrative support. The competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly as it relates to hourly personnel in the domestic communities in which our manufacturing facilities are located. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nCatastrophic or extraordinary events, including epidemics or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt global economic activity and/or demand and negatively impact our financial performance and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic.\nGlobal measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 resulted in a significant decline in global business activity that may have a lasting impact on the global economy and consumer demand. While our operating results for fiscal 2021 show a recovery of the textile supply chain, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its long-term impact on our businesses is currently unknown.\nSignificant restoration of consumer spending and retail activity will be critical to both our end-markets and an overall economic rebound. UNIFI anticipates a sustainable recovery in global economic activity when COVID-19 and its variants are sufficiently contained. The economic rebound will depend on the pace and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national, state, and local governments, along with the speed and effectiveness with which testing, treatment and vaccine methods are deployed.\nUNIFI will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic by prioritizing health and safety while delivering on customer demand.\nDuring fiscal 2021, our businesses navigated the COVID-19 pandemic well and we generated operating cash flows, reduced our debt principal, gained temporary market share in Brazil, and created momentum for fiscal 2022. However, the COVID-19 pandemic could resurge or another epidemic or pandemic could arise, and we will accordingly remain diligent and responsive to ensure the vitality of the organization.", "PERMNO": 78044, "SIC": 2200, "TIC": "UFI"}
