RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the recent \u201cCOVID-19\u201d pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economy, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and orders to \u201cshelter-in-place,\u201d and created significant disruption of the financial markets. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how the pandemic impacts our customers, employees, supply chain, and distribution network. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results for fiscal 2020, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Project disengagements and delays and decreases in customer demand in response to the pandemic, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession or depression. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate the other risks discussed in this Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\", any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation continues to change rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or similar health epidemics, could negatively impact our supply chain thereby adversely affecting our business.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including, among others, restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the country and in regions worldwide. As a result of the pandemic and the measures designed to contain the spread of the virus, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to supply our components according to our schedule and specifications. Any reduction in production capacity or capacity at our suppliers may reduce or even halt the supply of goods and necessary components for many of our customers\u2019 products, which could result in product shortages and an increase in our inventory of unfinished products. Further, there may be logistics issues, including our ability and our supply chain\u2019s ability to quickly ramp up production, and transportation demands that may cause further delays. If our suppliers\u2019 operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. While the disruptions and restrictions on the ability to travel, quarantines, and any temporary closures of the facilities of our suppliers, as well as general limitations on movement are expected to be temporary, the duration of the production and supply chain disruption, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should the production and distribution closures continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may significantly disrupt our workforce and internal operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may significantly disrupt our workforce, including our ability to hire and onboard employees, if a significant percentage of our employees or any potential hires are unable to work due to illness, quarantines, government\nactions, facility closures in response to the pandemic, fear of acquiring COVID-19 while performing essential business functions, or as a result of changes to unemployment insurance where unemployed workers can receive benefits in excess of what would be offered for working for us. While we remain fully operational at this time, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately staff our operations when needed, particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, which may strain our existing personnel, increase costs, and negatively impact our operations. As a result, our internal operations may experience disruptions. The pandemic may create additional challenges in attracting and retaining quality employees in the future. In addition, COVID-19 related-illness could impact members of our Board of Directors resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors, making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full Board of Directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs. We cannot predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our workforce and internal operations.\nWe have taken certain precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic that could harm our business.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken measures intended to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers and our communities, which could negatively impact our business. These measures include temporarily requiring certain employees to work remotely, restricted employee travel, increasing the frequency and extent of cleaning and disinfecting facilities, developing social distancing plans, and cancelling in-person meetings, events and conferences. The health of our workforce, customers and others is of primary concern and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and others. In addition, our management team has, and will likely continue to, spend significant time, attention and resources monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to manage its effects on our business and workforce. The extent to which the pandemic and our precautionary measures may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may decrease demand for our services and any such decrease in demand would adversely affect our backlog, revenues and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating uncertainty in the markets we serve and the duration, scope or impact of the outbreak cannot be predicted. While we have experienced some increase in demand from the medical and aerospace & defense sectors, we may face decreased demand in these or other sectors in the future. Demand for our services may be affected by changes in demand from our customers as a result of the pandemic, including any heightened emphasis on shorter lead times which places increased demands on our capacity and may result in increased costs, or the ordering of smaller quantities which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower costs. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may require customers to make unexpected changes to their product offerings which may adversely affect our business and operating results. Any material modifications, delays, payment defaults or cancellations on underlying contracts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic could reduce the amount of backlog currently reported and, consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues. In addition, worsening overall market conditions could result in further reductions of backlog, which will impact our financial performance. While the pandemic is expected to affect customer demand, it is difficult to predict such changes at this time and the impact that such changes will have on our revenues and operating margins. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing effective strategies to counter any changes in demand. Any decrease in demand or disruption to our business resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to meet the demands of our customers, including those in the aerospace & defense and medical sectors, as expected which may adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the aerospace & defense sector represented 60% of our business and the medical sector represented 26% of our business. Due to the nature of the lifesaving and mission critical products provided by these markets, many of our customers in these sectors are deemed to be essential businesses. In response to the pandemic and the increased demand for aerospace & defense, medical and lifesaving products, we experienced increases in demand from existing customers in the aerospace & defense and medical sectors. This demand has increased at the same time our supply chain has begun to face limitations, which may result in a shortage of supply, increased costs, and delays, requiring us in certain instances to pass through expenses or otherwise increase prices. Customers may reject any attempts to pass through expenses or increase pricing which would negatively impact our business. Further, if we are unable to ramp up our production, hire and onboard sufficient staff to meet the increased demand, or if we are otherwise unable to timely meet the demand from our customers, our business and results of operations will be negatively affected. The realization of our backlog is affected by our performance and the late completion of a project may result in decreased revenues derived from those projects. In addition, the increase in demand we are currently experiencing from the medical sector as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue after the pandemic subsides. Moreover, the increase in demand may result in decreased demand for such products after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides because there may be a large surplus of such medical products after the pandemic subsides.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe depend on a relatively small number of customers, the loss of one or more of whom may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nA relatively small number of customers are responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our five largest customers accounted for 68% and 51% of net sales, respectively. The percentage of our sales to our major customers may fluctuate from period to period, and our principal customers may also vary from year to year. Significant reduction in sales to any of our major customers, or the loss of a major customer, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on the continued growth and financial stability of our customers, including our major customers. Adverse changes in the end markets they serve can reduce demand from our customers in those markets and/or make customers in these end markets more price sensitive. Further, mergers or restructuring among our customers, or their end customers, could increase concentration or reduce total demand as the combined entities reevaluate their business and consolidate their suppliers. Future developments, particularly in those end markets that account for more significant portions of our revenues, could harm our business and our results of operations.\nBecause of this concentration in our customer base, we have significant amounts of trade accounts receivable from some of our customers. If one or more of our customers experiences financial difficulty and is unable to provide timely payment for the services provided, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, consolidation among our customers could intensify this concentration and adversely affect our business. In the event of consolidation among our customers, depending on which organization controls the supply chain function following the consolidation, we may not be retained as a preferred or approved supplier. In addition, product duplication could result in the termination of a product line that we currently support. While there is potential for increasing our position with the combined customer, our revenues could decrease if we are not retained as a continuing supplier. Even if we are retained as a supplier, we may also face the risk of increased pricing pressure from the combined customer because of its increased market share.\nWe participate in the electronics industry, which historically produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles.\nFactors affecting the electronics industry in general could seriously harm our customers and, as a result, us. These factors may include, but may not be limited to:\n\u2022the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which result in short product life cycles;\n\u2022the inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested;\n\u2022increased competition among our customers and their competitors, including downward pressure on pricing;\n\u2022the potential that our customers\u2019 products may become obsolete, or the failure of our customers\u2019 products to gain anticipated commercial acceptance; and\n\u2022periods of significantly decreased demand in our customers\u2019 markets.\nBecause a significant portion of our business is defense-related, reductions or delays in U.S. defense spending may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.\nDuring fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our sales to customers serving the aerospace and defense industries approximated 60% of our sales in both years. Because these products and services are ultimately sold to the U.S. government by our customers, these sales are affected by, among other things, the federal budget process, which is driven by numerous factors beyond our control, including geopolitical, macroeconomic and political conditions. The contracts between our direct customers and their government customers are subject to political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in short-range and long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes, the government\u2019s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements.\nWhile we believe that our customers\u2019 programs are well aligned with national defense and other priorities, shifts in domestic and international spending and tax policy, changes in security, defense and intelligence priorities, the affordability of our products and services, general economic conditions and developments, and other factors may affect a decision to fund or the level of funding for existing or proposed programs. An impasse in federal budget decision-making could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. As a result, U.S. government funding for certain of our customers has been and could continue to be reduced, delayed or eliminated, which could significantly impact these customers\u2019 demand for our products and services and if so this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\nThe accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for U.S. government contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense. Such audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. We cannot ensure the outcome of any future audits and adjustments may be required to reduce net sales or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit or review were to uncover inaccurate costs or improper activities, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from conducting future business with the U.S. government. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by economic slowdowns in the medical sector.\nThe medical sector represented approximately 26% and 22% of our sales during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. Medical device industries are intensely competitive and heavily regulated. Medical businesses must operate within an evolving regulatory and risk environment, with ongoing pricing and cost pressures, and adoption of new business models driven by scientific and technological advances. Any significant change in production rates or any restructuring by customers in this sector would likely have a material effect on our results of operations. There is no assurance that our customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels, that we will retain any or all of our existing customers or that we will be able to form new relationships with customers upon the loss of one or more of our existing customers in this market. Any material reduction in sales, consolidation or slowdowns in the medical sector could have a negative impact on our business and financial results.\nGlobal economic and financial market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrent global economic and financial market conditions, including the onset of a global economic recession, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These conditions may also materially impact our customers and suppliers. Economic and financial market conditions that adversely affect our customers may cause them to terminate or delay existing purchase orders or to reduce the volume of products they purchase from us in the future. We may be owed significant balances from customers that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions that could impair their ability to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis. Failure to collect a significant portion of those receivables could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSimilarly, adverse changes in credit terms extended to us by our suppliers, such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts payable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us could significantly affect our liquidity and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial market conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and this could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nTariffs imposed by the U.S. and those imposed in response by other countries, as well as rapidly changing trade relations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign governments\u2019 trade policies have resulted in, and may continue to result in, tariffs on imports into and exports from the U.S. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on imports from several countries, including China, Canada and the European Union. In response, China, Canada and the European Union have proposed or implemented their own tariffs on certain products and product components, including components we use, impacting our supply chain and increasing our costs of doing business. Although the majority of our customers allow us to recover tariffs, if we are unable to recover these costs, our profit margins may be negatively impacted. Continued diminished trade relations between the U.S. and other countries, including potential reductions in trade with China and others, as well as the continued escalation of tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nA failure of our information technology systems, including the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA failure or prolonged interruption in our information technology systems, some of which are aging, or difficulties encountered in upgrading our systems or implementing new systems, that compromises our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs, or impairs our ability to record, process and report accurate information could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are in the process of implementing a financial reporting system, Epicor ERP Software (\u201cEpicor\u201d), as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. Epicor will assist with the collection, storage, management and\ninterpretation of data from our business activities to support future growth and to integrate significant processes. Enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system implementations are complex and time-consuming and involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities, as well as changes in business processes. As part of the Epicor implementation, certain changes to our processes and procedures have and will continue to occur. These changes will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. While Epicor is designed to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as each of the affected areas evolve.\nOur ERP system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record transactions, provide important information to our management and prepare our consolidated financial statements. ERP system implementations also require the transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system; any such transformation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of a new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. Additionally, if the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be further impacted.\nProducts we manufacture may contain defects in workmanship, which could result in reduced demand for our services and product liability claims against us.\nWe manufacture highly complex products to our customers\u2019 specifications, often within tight tolerance ranges, and such products may contain design or manufacturing errors or defects. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by customer design, workmanship, component failure, the use of component suppliers\u2019 products or services, or other error, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders, adversely affecting our reputation and may result in product liability claims against us. Even if customers or component suppliers are responsible for the defects, they may be unwilling or unable to assume responsibility for costs associated with product failure, which could adversely affect our reputation, customer relationships, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain the engineering, technological and manufacturing capabilities required by our customers in the future.\nThe markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to:\n\u2022hire and retain qualified engineering and technical personnel;\n\u2022maintain and enhance our technological leadership; and\n\u2022develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs.\nAlthough we believe that our operations provide the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, there is no certainty that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive; or we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment that could adversely affect our operating results, as could our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers\u2019 changing technological requirements.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel and other skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent on our ability to recruit, train, and retain skilled employees, particularly executive management and technical employees. The competition for these individuals is significant. Accordingly, the loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could negatively impact us.\nFurther, any new acquisitions or developments by us will require the hiring of significant additional workforce to support operations at such properties. Any shortage of skilled labor in the areas of these operations could result in our having insufficient personnel to expand production and fully utilize capacity at our new or developed properties, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As a result of our acquisitions and developments, we may be more susceptible to labor shortages than our competitors.\nIncreases in minimum wage could increase the cost of our labor and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or above the applicable federal or state minimum wage. From time to time, federal and state governments have increased and will consider increases in the minimum wage. Several states in which we operate have enacted increases in the minimum wage and legislation to increase the minimum wage may be enacted in the future in states in which we operate. As federal or state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to our other hourly employees in order to remain competitive. Any increase in the cost of our labor could have an adverse effect on our operating costs, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from period to period.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors may include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\u2022adverse changes in general economic conditions;\n\u2022natural disasters that may impede our operations, the operation of our customers\u2019 business, or availability of manufacturing inputs from our suppliers;\n\u2022the level and timing of customer orders and the accuracy of customer forecasts;\n\u2022the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs;\n\u2022price competition;\n\u2022market acceptance of our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022business conditions in our customers\u2019 end markets;\n\u2022our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product;\n\u2022changes in the mix of sales to our customers;\n\u2022variations in efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and property, plant and equipment;\n\u2022fluctuations in cost and availability of materials;\n\u2022timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders;\n\u2022changes in cost and availability of labor and components;\n\u2022our effectiveness in managing the high reliability manufacturing process required by our customers; and\n\u2022failure or external breach of our information technology systems.\nThe EMS industry is affected by the United States and global economies, both of which are influenced by world events. An economic slowdown, particularly in the industries we serve, may result in our customers reducing their forecasts or delaying orders. The demand for our services could weaken, which in turn could substantially influence our sales, capacity utilization, margins and financial results.\nIf we experience deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and procedures, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our investors\u2019 confidence in our reported financial information, and there is no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting and procedures will not fail in the future.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud. We have been and may be required in the future to expend funds and resources in order to rectify identified deficiencies in our internal controls. Our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors or all instances of fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our business have been detected. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The benefits of a control system also must be considered relative to the costs of the system and management\u2019s judgments regarding the likelihood of potential events. There can be no assurance that any control system will succeed in achieving its goals under all possible future conditions, and as a result of these inherent limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may or may not be detected. If there is a failure in any of our internal controls and procedures, we could face investigation or enforcement actions by the SEC and other governmental and regulatory bodies, litigation, loss of reputation and investor confidence, the inability to acquire capital, and other material adverse effects on our finances and business operations.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that may constrain the operation of our business, and our failure to comply with these covenants may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our secured bank credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (\u201cM&T Bank\u201d) and other existing debt contain various covenants that, among other things, require us\nto comply with certain financial covenants including maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio. The agreements and instruments governing the Credit Facility require financial and other reporting, contain limitations on revolving loan borrowings and restrict or limit our ability to take certain corporate actions.\nThe Credit Facility is secured by a general security agreement covering the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, a pledge of the Company\u2019s equity interest in its subsidiaries, a negative pledge on the Company\u2019s real property, and a guarantee by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, all of which restrict use of these assets to support other financial instruments.\nTo the extent we are required to seek waivers and/or amendments, we may experience increased borrowing costs. If we are not in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and if M&T Bank chooses to exercise its remedies, M&T Bank could accelerate our primary indebtedness which could cause cross-defaults with respect to other obligations, causing a material adverse effect on our financial condition including, our inability to obtain replacement financing or continue operations. Our ability to comply with covenants contained in our Credit Facility and other existing debt may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\nWe are subject to ongoing compliance obligations in connection with an administrative order and our failure to comply with those obligations could adversely affect our business and the liquidity of our common stock.\nIn June 2016, we consented to the entry of a settled administrative order by the SEC (the \u201cAdministrative Order\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and certain rules thereunder. If we are found to be in violation of the Administrative Order, we may be subject to additional enforcement actions or lawsuits that could lead to added penalties and consequences which may be more severe than if we were not subject to the Administrative Order. The costs of such actions and of defending lawsuits could be significant and exceed the amount of our available insurance coverage. Governmental scrutiny, pending or future investigations by regulators or law enforcement agencies or legal proceedings involving us or our affiliates could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nStart-up costs and inefficiencies related to new or transferred programs can have a material adverse effect on our operating results and may not be recoverable.\nOur long-term success depends in part upon our ability to support our customers as they bring new products and programs to market, or transfer programs to us. Often these products and programs have technological issues and require, or our customers desire, engineering and other changes and innovations in order to facilitate full-scale production and end-user acceptance. Although some of these programs, particularly in the defense and space industries, once mature, will likely profitably extend over many years and will be difficult to transfer to our competitors, we may have to make significant upfront investments in them that may be recovered only over the longer term. These investments may have a significant impact on our profitability in nearer term periods. Moreover, start-up costs, including the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with establishing new programs and new customer relationships, and difficulties in estimating required resources and the timing of those resources in advance of production, can adversely affect our operating results. If new programs or customer relationships are terminated or delayed, this could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly in the near term, as we may not recoup those start-up costs or quickly replace anticipated new program revenues.\nSome of our customers may have regulatory issues that adversely affect our operating results.\nSome of our larger customers are in heavily regulated industries, such as health care. If they encounter issues with their regulators related to products we manufacture for them, there may be long delays in resolving those issues or the issues may not be resolved at all, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may not realize the full value of our backlog, which may result in lower than expected revenue.\nAt the end of fiscal 2020, our backlog was $194.5 million. We may never realize all of the revenue included in our present backlog. In addition, there can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period due to the receipt, timing, and amount of revenue under contracts included in backlog being subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. Even if our revenue included in our backlog is realized, there can be no guarantee that the revenue realization will result in a profit. A failure to realize any or all of the revenue included in our present backlog could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMost of the customers in our industry do not commit to long-term production schedules, which can make it difficult for us to schedule production.\nCustomers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for any number of reasons that are beyond our ability to foresee or control. Although we are always seeking new opportunities, we may not be able to replace any deferred, reduced or canceled orders. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers could adversely affect our operating results and working capital levels. Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred and may occur again. The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to:\n\u2022variation in demand for our customers\u2019 products in their end markets;\n\u2022actions taken by our customers to manage their inventory;\n\u2022product design changes by our customers; or\n\u2022changes in our customers\u2019 manufacturing strategy.\nDue in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm, long-term production schedules. Therefore, we make significant judgments based on our estimates of customer requirements, including:\n\u2022deciding on the levels of business that we will seek;\n\u2022production schedules;\n\u2022component procurement commitments;\n\u2022equipment requirements;\n\u2022personnel needs; and\n\u2022other resource requirements.\nIncreased competition may result in decreased demand or reduced prices for our products and services.\nThe EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. Additionally, consolidation in the electronic industry could result in an increasing number of very large electronics companies offering products similar to ours in multiple sectors of the EMS industry. We may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to larger EMS providers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of other efficiencies of scale or their geographic location. As a result, other EMS providers with significant purchasing and marketing power may have a competitive advantage. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce the prices of their products or services and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. Any of these factors may cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance for our products or services, profit margin compression, or loss of market share.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. A shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nFor fiscal 2020, IEC obtained 22% of the materials used in production from two vendors Avnet, Inc. and Arrow Electronics, Inc. If our vendors were to cease supplying us with materials for any reason, we would be forced to find alternative sources of supply. A change in suppliers could cause a delay in availability of products and a possible loss of sales, which could adversely affect operating results.\nMuch of our net revenue is derived from turn-key manufacturing for which we provide the materials specified by our customers. Some of our customer agreements permit periodic adjustments to pricing based on increases or decreases in component prices and other factors. However, we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re-pricing dates or, if such re-pricing is not permitted during the balance of the term of a particular customer agreement. As a result, some component price increases may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, if we cannot increase prices enough to offset increased costs or if increased prices lead to canceled orders.\nMany of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from a limited number of suppliers. In response to supply shortages, some of these components are from time to time subject to allocation limits. In some cases, supply shortages or delayed deliveries could substantially curtail production of those assemblies requiring a limited-supply component, which could contribute to an increase in our inventory levels, and could delay shipments to customers and the associated revenue of all products using that component. Component shortages have been prevalent in our industry, and such shortages may recur. An increase in economic activity could result in shortages if manufacturers of components do not adequately anticipate increased order volume or if they have excessively reduced their production capabilities. World events,\narmed conflict, governmental regulation, embargoes and changes in trade relations, natural disaster, and epidemics could also affect our supply chain, leading to an inability to obtain sufficient components on a timely basis.\nIn addition, due to the specialized nature of some components and our customers\u2019 product specifications, we may be required to use sole-source suppliers for certain components. Such suppliers may encounter financial or operational difficulties that could cause delays in or the curtailment of component deliveries.\nOur turn-key manufacturing services involve inventory risk.\nOur turn-key manufacturing services described above involve a greater investment in inventory and a corresponding increase in risk as compared to consignment services, for which the customer provides all materials. For example, in our turn-key operations, we must frequently order parts and supplies in minimum lot sizes that may be larger than the quantity of product ultimately needed for our customers. Customers\u2019 cancellation or reduction of orders could result in additional expense to us. If we are not reimbursed for excess inventory ordered to meet customer forecasts, we may accumulate excess inventory and/or incur return charges imposed by suppliers. In addition, component price increases and inventory obsolescence associated with turn-key orders could adversely affect our operating results.\nFurthermore, we provide inventory management programs for some of our customers under which we are required to hold and manage finished goods inventories. Such inventory management programs may lead to higher finished goods inventory levels, reduced inventory turns and increased financial exposure. In cases where customers have contractual obligations to purchase managed inventories from us, we remain subject to the risk of enforcing the obligation.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions, both physical and virtual, could compromise our information, harm customer relationships and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe have access to, create and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our employees. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. As certain of our employees work remotely in accordance with government mandates related to the ongoing pandemic, we face heightened cyber-security risks related to unauthorized system access, aggressive social engineering tactics, and attacks on our information technology systems used to conduct our business. For example, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we were subject to a cyber incident which, individually and in the aggregate, did not result in a material impact to our operations or financial condition. While we have taken preventative measures to mitigate this risk, we can provide no assurance that we will not be the subject of similar cyberattacks in the future. Cybersecurity breaches, system disruptions and failures may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our customers and expose our business and our customers to harm. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be improperly accessed, disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation or our customer relationships, impair our ability to record, process and report accurate information to our stockholders and the SEC, or result in legal claims or proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues and competitive position. We carry cyber insurance to minimize the potential impact that a security breach may have on our financial condition or results of operations; however, liabilities incurred in connection with a security breach could exceed the limit that our insurer will pay or reimburse, in which case we would bear these fees and costs directly.\nOur manufacturing processes and services may result in exposure to intellectual property infringement and other claims.\nProviding manufacturing services can expose us to potential claims that products, designs or manufacturing processes we use infringe third party intellectual property rights. Even though many of our manufacturing services contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us for infringement claims relating to their products, including associated product specifications and designs, a particular customer may not, or may not have the resources to, assume responsibility for such claims. In addition, we may be responsible for claims that our manufacturing processes or components used in manufacturing infringe third party intellectual property rights. Infringement claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, potential injunctive action, or hamper our normal operations such as by interfering with the availability of components and, regardless of merits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In the event of such a claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain and maintain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining and maintaining such a license on reasonable terms or at all. Our customers may be required to or decide to discontinue products which are alleged to be infringing rather than face continued costs of defending the infringement claims, and such discontinuance may result in a significant decrease in our business.\nA failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, including those related to social responsibility and conflict minerals, could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own social responsibility, conflict minerals, quality or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations, such as the SEC\u2019s conflict mineral rules.\nOur compliance with these policies, standards and third party certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competitiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.\nIf we are unable to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization rates, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nGiven the high fixed costs of our operations, decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our business. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or enhance gross margins continues to depend, in part, on maintaining satisfactory capacity utilization rates. In turn, our ability to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization depends on the demand for our products, the volume of orders we receive, and our ability to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements at competitive prices. If current or future production capacity fails to match current or future customer demands, our facilities would be underutilized, our sales may not fully cover our fixed overhead expenses, and we would be less likely to achieve anticipated gross margins. If forecasts and assumptions used to support the implied fair value of goodwill or realizability of our long-lived assets including intangible assets change, we may incur significant impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as we have experienced.\nIn addition, we generally schedule our production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our ability to respond to unexpected additional quick-turn orders. However, if these orders are not received, we may forego some production and could experience continued excess capacity. If we conclude that we have significant, long-term excess capacity, we may decide to permanently close one or more of our facilities and lay off some of our employees. Closures or lay-offs could result in our recording restructuring charges such as severance and other exit costs, and asset impairments.\nIf our customers choose to provide manufacturing services in-house or overseas, our results of operations could suffer.\nOur business has benefited from OEMs deciding to outsource their EMS needs to us. Our future revenue growth depends, in part, on new outsourcing opportunities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our performance against other providers, including off-shore procurement opportunities. They also evaluate the potential benefits of manufacturing these products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available either due to OEM decisions to produce these products themselves or to use other domestic or foreign providers, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and prospects.\nWe may experience disruptions to our business as a result of the relocation of our headquarters and a significant portion of our operations.\nWe expect to open a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, including our headquarters and a significant portion of our operations, in Newark, New York. The process of moving our operations to a new facility is not part of our typical day-to-day operations and may be complex. This relocation process could cause significant disruption to our operations and productivity. We can give no assurance that the relocation will be completed as planned or within the anticipated timeframe. Additionally, the relocation may involve significant costs and the expected benefits of the relocation may not be fully realized due to any associated disruption to our operations and personnel.\nAcquired properties and development may subject us to unanticipated liabilities.\nProperties that we have acquired, or those we may acquire in the future, may subject us to unanticipated liabilities for which we would have no recourse, or only limited recourse, to the former owners of such facilities, including the discovery of structural or other latent defects in the property. As a result, if a third party claim for liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of an acquired facility, we might be required to pay significant sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our financial results and cash flow. Unknown liabilities relating to acquired facilities could include, among other things, (i) liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, (ii) claims by vendors or other persons arising on account of actions or omissions of the former owners of the facilities, and (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.\nFurther, acquiring properties that are not yet fully developed or need substantial renovation, rehabilitation or redevelopment poses additional risks, including delays or cost overruns due to a variety of factors including, material or labor shortages, difficulties in obtaining necessary permits and authorizations, and unanticipated changes in scope of the project due to unforeseen structural or environmental issues. Any failure to complete a redevelopment project in a timely manner and within budget could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nDemand estimates for investments in new properties or development may not result in the benefits we anticipate from these investments.\nSubstantial capital investments are made in connection with acquisitions and development of our properties to increase our capacity. If we overestimate demand, we may not realize the benefit we anticipate from these investments. Overestimates in customer demand could result in excess capacity at our properties, which would result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with current and future governmental regulations related to defense, health and safety and the environment could impair our operations or cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe are subject to a variety of United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services, as well as federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to employee occupational health and safety, and environmental and waste management regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing process. To date, the cost to us of such compliance has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, violations may occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. While we are not currently aware of any violations, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant compliance-related expenses.\nWe may face heightened liability risks specific to our medical device business as a result of additional healthcare regulatory related compliance requirements and the potential severe consequences that could result from manufacturing defects or malfunctions (e.g., death or serious injury) of the medical devices we manufacture, design or test.\nAs a manufacturer and designer of medical devices for our customers, we have compliance requirements in addition to those relating to other areas of our business. We are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations and to implement design and process manufacturing controls, quality control, labeling, handling and documentation procedures. The FDA, through periodic inspections and product field monitoring, continually reviews and rigorously monitors compliance with these QSR requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements. If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance, and we do not address the FDA\u2019s concerns to its satisfaction, the FDA may take action against us, including issuing a form noting the FDA\u2019s inspection observations, a notice of violation or a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against us and our officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility or temporarily halting operations at or shutting down a manufacturing facility. If any of these were to occur, our reputation and business could suffer.\nIn addition, any defects or malfunctions in medical devices we manufacture or in our manufacturing processes and facilities may result in liability claims against us, expose us to liability to pay for the recall or remanufacture of a product, or otherwise adversely affect product sales or our reputation. The magnitude of such claims could be particularly severe as defects in medical devices could cause severe harm or injuries, including death, to users of these products and others.", "PERMNO": 78892, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "IEC"}
