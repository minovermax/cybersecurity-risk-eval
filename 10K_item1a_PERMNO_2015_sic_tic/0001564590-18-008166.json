The occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe have concluded that we need to restructure our balance sheet to continue as a going concern over the long term, and we can provide no assurances of the terms of any such restructuring transaction in which we may engage or how any such transaction will impact our security-holders.\nAs a result of extremely challenging current market conditions, we believe we will require a significant restructuring of our balance sheet in order to continue as a going concern in the long term. We have based this belief on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources less or more rapidly than currently expected. In September 2017, we entered into confidentiality agreements and commenced discussions with legal and financial advisors for a committee of holders of our outstanding senior notes (the \u201cNoteholders\u201d), who have represented to the Company that they hold a substantial portion of our outstanding senior notes, to explore one or more possible restructuring, financing, refinancing, reorganization, recapitalization, amendment, waiver, forbearance, asset sale and/or similar transactions involving the Company. Subsequent to the date of the execution of those confidentiality agreements, the Noteholder advisors conducted due diligence on the Company and engaged in discussions with us and our advisors. In early January 2018, we entered into confidentiality agreements with the Noteholders to discuss a possible transaction and subsequently engaged in negotiation with the Noteholders with respect to a potential transaction. We have not yet reached agreement on mutually acceptable terms and conditions with the Noteholders regarding a possible transaction.\nThere can be no assurance that our efforts will result in any agreement or what the terms of any agreement will be. If an agreement is reached and we pursue a restructuring, it may be necessary for us to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement the agreement through the confirmation and consummation of a plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court in the bankruptcy proceedings. We also may conclude that it is necessary to initiate Chapter 11 proceedings to implement a restructuring of our obligations even if we are unable to reach an agreement with our creditors and other relevant parties regarding the terms of such a restructuring. In either case, such a proceeding could be commenced in the near term. If a plan of reorganization is implemented in a bankruptcy proceeding, it is possible that holders of claims and interests with respect to, or rights to acquire, our equity securities would be entitled to little or no recovery, and those claims and interests may be canceled for little or no consideration. If that were to occur, we anticipate that all or substantially all of the value of all investments in our equity securities would be lost and that our equity holders would lose all or substantially all of their investment. It is also possible that our other stakeholders, including our secured and unsecured creditors, will receive substantially less than the amount of their claims.\nOur potential for restructuring transactions may impact our business, financial condition and operations.\nDue to the potential for a restructuring of our balance sheet, there is risk that, among other things:\n\u2022\nthird parties lose confidence in our ability to continue to operate in the ordinary course, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u2022\nit may become more difficult to attract, retain or replace key employees;\n\u2022\nemployees could be distracted from performance of their duties;\n\u2022\nwe could lose some or a significant portion of our liquidity, either due to stricter credit terms from vendors, or, in the event we undertake a Chapter 11 proceeding and conclude that we need to procure debtor-in-possession financing, an inability to obtain any needed debtor-in-possession financing or to provide adequate protection to certain secured lenders to permit us to access some or all of our cash; and\n\u2022\nour vendors, hedge counterparties, and service providers could seek to renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThe occurrence of certain of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $799.9 million of debt outstanding, including $600.3 million related to our senior notes, $189.5 million outstanding on our delayed draw term loan credit facility and $10.1 million related to other obligations. We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under our term loan credit facility. At December 31, 2017, we had additional available borrowing capacity of $78.5 million under our term loan credit facility.\nAs a result of our indebtedness, we will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest, which will reduce the amount we will have available to fund our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. Our indebtedness under our term loan credit facility is at a variable interest rate, so a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges. Our aggregate interest expense also increased when the interest rate applicable to our outstanding senior secured second lien notes increased from 1.00% per annum to 8.00% per annum commencing on October 1, 2017 in accordance with the terms of those notes. The amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe may incur substantially more debt in the future. The indentures governing our senior notes contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness. These restrictions, however, are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. Moreover, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as that term is defined in the respective indentures.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors, many of which we are unable to control and our ability to restructure our balance sheet. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt, we may be required to refinance debt, sell assets, or issue additional equity on terms that we may not find attractive, if it may be done at all. In the event that we are unable to comply with the financial covenants in our term loan credit facility, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders. Further, any failure by us to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness, or to obtain a related waiver from our lenders, could result in a default or event of default under that indebtedness, which could trigger the acceleration of a significant portion of our indebtedness and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural gas, NGL and oil prices have been volatile and are currently depressed. If commodity prices remain depressed for a lengthy period of time or experience a further substantial or extended decline, our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe prices we receive for our condensate, NGL and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Natural gas and oil are commodities, and therefore their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for natural gas and oil have been volatile. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in global supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs, and oil;\n\u2022\nthe condition of the U.S. and global economy impacting the global supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs, and oil;\n\u2022\nthe actions of certain foreign states;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in natural gas, NGL, and oil producing countries globally, including embargoes, terrorist attacks, threats, and escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war;\n\u2022\nthe level of global natural gas and oil exploration and production activity;\n\u2022\nthe level of global natural gas and oil inventories;\n\u2022\nproduction or pricing decisions made by OPEC and state-controlled oil companies;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and the occurrence of natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\neffect of energy conservation efforts; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nFurthermore, natural gas and oil prices continued to be volatile in 2017. For example, the WTI oil spot price in 2017 ranged from a high of $60.42 to a low of $42.53 per Bbl and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices in 2017 ranged from a high of $3.42 to a low of $2.56 per MMBtu.\nPrices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we will be able to borrow in the future under our term loan credit facility is subject to our compliance with a ratio of our net senior secured debt to EBITDAX, and our ability to meet that ratio currently and in the future is based in part on current natural gas and oil prices and on changing expectations of future prices.\nLower natural gas, NGL, and oil prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per-unit basis, but also may reduce the amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically. A sustained decline in natural gas, NGL, or oil prices, or a further increase in our negative differentials, may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nCommodity prices have declined substantially from historic highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. If commodity prices continue to remain depressed, we may be required to take additional write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties, some of our undeveloped locations may no longer be economically viable, the value of our estimated proved reserves could be reduced materially, we may need to sell assets or raise capital and we may not be able to pay our expenses or service our indebtedness.\nDuring the nine years prior to December 31, 2017, natural gas prices at Henry Hub have ranged from a high of $13.31 per MMBtu in 2008 to a low of $1.49 per MMBtu in 2016. On December 31, 2017, the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.95 per MMBtu. The reduction in prices has been caused by many factors, including increases in natural gas production and reserves from unconventional (shale) reservoirs, without an offsetting increase in demand.\nIn addition, oil prices have declined significantly since the second half of 2014. The price of WTI crude oil was $60.42 per barrel on December 31, 2017, which, although an increase year-over-year, is a significant decline from $106.70 per barrel on June 30, 2014. This environment could cause the commodity prices for oil and natural gas to remain at currently depressed levels or to fall to lower levels.\nThere is a risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties. We account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs of productive exploratory wells, developmental dry holes, and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, certain geological and geophysical expenses, and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from our properties. If capitalized costs exceed future cash flows, we write down the costs of the properties to our estimate of fair market value. Any such charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities, but will reduce our earnings.\nThe application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive but may actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic, which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. Wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature, and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results. The evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area.\nWe review our oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value. Once incurred, a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if gas or oil prices increase. Given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets, events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the book values associated with oil and gas properties.\nDuring 2017, we recorded impairment expense of $21.4 million. Additional write-downs could occur if oil and gas prices continue to decline or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs, or deterioration in our drilling results, absent other mitigating circumstances. The risk we will be required to write-down the carrying value of our properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile. Because our properties currently serve, and will likely continue to serve, as collateral for advances under our existing and future credit facilities, a write-down in the carrying values of our properties could prevent us from being able to comply with the covenants in our term loan credit agreement and to borrow additional amounts thereunder. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nIn addition, we may be required to sell assets or raise capital by issuing additional debt (including additional priority lien debt) or equity in order pay expenses and service indebtedness. Furthermore, the value of our assets, if sold, may not be sufficient to pay our expenses or service our indebtedness. On January 20, 2016, we suspended payment of our quarterly dividend on shares of our 6.0% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.001per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). We recommenced paying the quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend paid on May 15, 2017 (which payments were applied t the earliest dividend in arrears at the time of payment), but the dividend remains five quarters in arrears.\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe natural gas and oil industry is capital intensive. We make, and expect to continue to make, substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for, and development, production, and acquisition of, oil and natural gas reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from bank borrowings, cash generated by operations, public stock offerings, high-yield bond offerings, sales of non-core assets, and joint venture agreements.\nWe intend to finance our future capital expenditures with proceeds from bank borrowings, the sale of debt or equity securities, asset sales, cash flow from operations, and current and new financing arrangements, such as joint ventures; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock, and in some cases, a substantial dilutive effect. Additional borrowings under our term loan credit facility or the issuance of additional debt securities will require a greater portion of our cash flow from operations to be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. In addition, our term loan credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than indebtedness under our term loan credit facility. If we desire to issue additional debt securities other than as expressly permitted under our term loan credit facility, we will be required to seek the consent of the lenders in accordance with the requirements of the term loan credit facility, which consent may be withheld by the lenders at their discretion. If we incur additional indebtedness, we may not be able to comply with our debt covenants under our term loan credit agreement or make additional borrowings thereunder. Also, our term loan credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, materially change our business, approve and distribute dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, create or acquire additional subsidiaries, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make loans to others, make investments, enter into mergers, incur liens, and enter into agreements regarding swap and other derivative transactions.\nOur cash on hand, cash flow from operations, ability to borrow funds and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour estimated proved natural gas, NGL, and oil reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of natural gas and oil we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nour ability to extract NGLs from the natural gas we produce;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which natural gas, NGLs, and oil are sold;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\n\u2022\nprevailing economic and capital markets conditions, especially for natural gas and oil companies.\nIf our revenues decrease as a result of lower natural gas, NGL, or oil prices; operating difficulties; declines in reserves; or for any other reason we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. We may need to seek additional financing in the future. In addition, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nWe are subject to various contractual limitations that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur term loan credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and the certificate of designations governing our Series A Preferred Stock contain, and any future indebtedness we incur will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants and limitations that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets, including equity interests in our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\npay distributions on, redeem or repurchase our common stock and, under certain circumstances, our Series A Preferred Stock, or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments or loans;\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock that is senior to our Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends or rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022\nredeem or prepay other debt;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nAdditionally, if dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears and unpaid for six or more quarterly periods, the holders (voting as a single class) of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our Board of Directors until paid in full. These dividends are currently in arrears for five quarterly periods.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nOur ability to comply with some of these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be impaired. A failure to comply with the covenants, ratios or tests in our term loan credit facility, the indentures governing our senior notes, or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our term loan credit facility, the indentures governing our senior notes, or our future indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If an event of default under our term loan credit facility occurs and remains uncured, the lenders thereunder:\n\u2022\nwould not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nmay have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\u2022\nmay prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements.\nA payment default or an acceleration under our term loan credit facility could result in an event of default and an acceleration under the indentures for our senior notes.\nIf the indebtedness under the senior notes were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that we would have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness in full. In addition, our obligations under our term loan credit facility are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the term loan credit facility, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nThe value of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, calculated using SEC pricing, may be different than the fair market value of our proved reserves calculated using current market prices.\nOur estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, Standardized Measure and related PV-10 were calculated under SEC rules using twelve-month trailing average benchmark prices of $47.79 per barrel of oil (WTI) and $2.98 per MMBtu (Henry Hub spot). The spot prices for oil and natural gas on March 29, 2018 were $64.94 per barrel of oil and $2.733 per MMBtu, respectively, higher than the benchmark price for a barrel of oil and lower per MMBtu referenced above. Using these more recent prices in estimating our proved reserves, without giving effect to any acquisitions or development activities we have executed in 2018, would likely result in an increase in proved reserve volumes. If spot prices on March 29, 2018 had been lower than the twelve-month trailing average benchmark prices used to calculate SEC estimated proved reserves, Standardized Measure and related PV-10, then estimates based on the lower spot prices would have resulted in a reduction in proved reserves volumes. As these illustrations demonstrate, volatility in pricing can have a significant impact on the Standardized Measure and PV-10 of our proved reserves.\nAlthough we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2018 production, our hedging program may be inadequate to protect us against continuing and prolonged declines in the price of natural gas and oil.\nOur first lien term loan requires us to hedge at certain levels of our estimated proved developed producing reserves. These hedges may be inadequate to protect us from a prolonged decline in the price of natural gas and oil. To the extent that the price of natural gas and oil decline, we will not be able to hedge future production at the same level as our current hedges, and our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted.\nDrilling for and producing natural gas, NGLs and oil are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development, and production activities. Our natural gas, NGL, and oil exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable natural gas, NGL, or oil production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop, or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data, and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. Please see below for a discussion of the uncertainties involved in these processes. Our costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or ability to finance planned capital expenditures could be materially and adversely affected by any factor that may curtail, delay, or cancel drilling, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nequipment malfunctions, failures, or accidents;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events and drilling conditions;\n\u2022\npipe or cement failures;\n\u2022\ncasing collapses;\n\u2022\nlost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil, and fluids;\n\u2022\nfires and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures, discharges of toxic gases or mishandling of fluids (including frac fluids) and underground migration issues;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nreductions in natural gas and oil prices;\n\u2022\nnatural gas and oil property title problems; and\n\u2022\nmarket limitations for natural gas and oil.\nIf any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field, or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe may experience differentials to benchmark prices in the future, which may be material.\nA substantial portion of our production is sold to purchasers at prices that reflect a discount to other relevant benchmark prices, such as WTI NYMEX. The difference between a benchmark price and the price we reference in our sales contracts is called a basis differential. Basis differentials result from variances in regional prices compared to benchmark prices as a result of regional supply and demand factors. We may experience differentials to benchmark prices in the future, which may be material.\nOur results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected by risks associated with our natural gas, NGL and oil financial derivative activities, and our natural gas, NGL, and oil financial derivative activities may limit potential gains.\nWe have entered into, and we expect to enter into in the future, oil and gas financial derivative arrangements corresponding to a significant portion of our natural gas and oil production. Many derivative instruments that we employ require us to make cash payments to the extent the applicable index exceeds a predetermined price, thereby limiting our ability to realize the benefit of increases in oil and natural gas prices. We made net payments of $10.1 million related to our commodity derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIf our actual production and sales for any period are less than the corresponding volume of derivative contracts for that period (including reductions in production due to operational delays), or if we are unable to perform our activities as planned, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. In addition, our natural gas and oil financial derivative activities can result in substantial losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including any circumstance in which a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable derivative arrangement, the arrangement is imperfect or our derivative policies and procedures are not followed or do not work as planned. Under the terms of our term loan credit facility the percentage of our total production volumes with respect to which we will be allowed to enter into derivative contracts is limited, and we therefore retain the risk of a price decrease for our remaining production volume.\nThe standardized measure and PV-10 of our estimated reserves included in this report should not be considered as the current fair value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties.\nStandardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our non-GAAP financial measure, PV-10, is a similar reporting convention that we have disclosed in this report. Both measures require the use of operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, they will not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for natural gas and oil production because of varying market conditions, nor may they reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the natural gas and oil properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor, which is required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our company or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Therefore, Standardized Measure or PV-10 included in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of our proved reserves.\nBased on December 31, 2017 reserve estimates, we project that a 10% decline in the price per barrel of oil, price per barrel of NGLs and the price per Mcf of gas from average 2017 prices would reduce our gross revenues, before the effects of derivatives, for the year ending December 31, 2018 by approximately $29.0 million.\nProspects that we decide to drill may not yield natural gas, NGLs or oil in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospects are in various stages of evaluation. There is no way to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield natural gas, NGLs or oil in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable, particularly in light of the current economic environment. The use of seismic data and other technologies, and the study of producing fields in the same area, will not enable us to know conclusively before drilling whether natural gas, NGLs or oil will be present or, if present, whether natural gas, NGLs or oil will be present in commercially viable quantities. Moreover, the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects.\nWe may be required to take additional write-downs of the carrying values of our natural gas and oil properties, potentially causing our inability to comply with the covenants in our term loan credit facility and /or our ability to make additional borrowings thereunder and negatively impacting the trading value of our securities.\nThere is a risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties. We account for our natural gas and oil exploration and development activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs of productive exploratory wells, developmental dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized. Natural gas and oil lease acquisition costs are also capitalized. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for natural gas and oil leases are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities. The capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from our properties. If capitalized costs exceed future cash flows, we write down the costs of the properties to our estimate of fair market value. Any such charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities, but will reduce our earnings and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay interest on our senior notes.\nThe application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive but may actually deliver natural gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic, which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. Wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature, and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results. The evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area.\nWe review our natural gas and oil properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value. Once incurred, a write down of natural gas and oil properties is not reversible at a later date even if natural gas or oil prices increase. Given the complexities associated with natural gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the natural gas and oil markets, events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the book values associated with oil and gas properties.\nDuring 2017, we recorded impairment expense of approximately $21.4 million. Additional write downs could occur if natural gas and oil prices continue to decline or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our drilling results, absent other mitigating circumstances. The risk we will be required to write down the carrying value of our properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are low or volatile. Because our properties currently serve, and will likely continue to serve, as collateral for advances under our existing and future credit facilities, a write-down in the carrying values of our properties may result in our inability to comply with the covenants in our term loan credit agreement or to borrow additional amounts thereunder. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nEstimates of natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. To prepare our proved reserve estimates, we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production, and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as natural gas, NGL, and oil prices; drilling and operating expenses; capital expenditures; taxes; and availability of funds.\nActual future production; natural gas, NGL, and oil prices; revenues; taxes; development expenditures; operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report. In addition, we may adjust estimates of estimated proved reserves to reflect production history; results of exploration and development; prevailing natural gas, NGL, and oil prices; and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas, NGL, and oil reserves.\nWe base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the day of estimate. However, actual future net cash flows from our natural gas and oil properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\nactual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for natural gas and oil; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nlanding our wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022\nrunning our casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u2022\nbeing able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022\nthe ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, we are more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If our drilling results are less than anticipated, the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimate of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. All of our drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, gathering system, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, natural gas and oil prices, drilling and production costs, drilling results, and other factors. Because of these uncertainties, we do not\nknow if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other potential drilling locations. Pursuant to SEC rules and guidance, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. The SEC rules and guidance may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program.\nUnless we replace our natural gas, NGL, and oil reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing natural gas, NGLs, and oil reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future natural gas, NGLs, and oil reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find, or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules, our ability to produce natural gas, NGLs, and condensate commercially and in commercial quantities could be impaired.\nWe use approximately 289,000 Bbls of water per well in our well completion operations in the Appalachian Basin. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of water after drilling, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, the adoption and implementation of new environmental regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or the imposition of new requirements pertaining to the management and disposal of wastes generated by our operations, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas, NGLs and condensate. Furthermore, new environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may also increase operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and drilling and completion services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget.\nWe may, from time to time, encounter difficulty in obtaining, or an increase in the cost of securing, drilling rigs, equipment, services, and supplies. In addition, larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment and services by offering more lucrative terms. If we are unable to acquire access to such resources, or can obtain access only at higher prices, our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal, state, and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe SDWA establishes the underground injection control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program, which governs the underground injection of substances. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state agencies; however, under the SDWA\u2019s UIC program, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities that involve the use of diesel fuel. In addition, bills have been introduced in prior sessions of Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. On November 30, 2017 the Delaware River Basin Commission, a federal-state agency, released draft regulations that would permanently prohibit anyone from using hydraulic fracturing to recover gas in the Delaware River Basin, which includes gas-bearing zones in eastern and northeastern Pennsylvania. In addition, many state governments, including Pennsylvania\u2019s and Ohio\u2019s, have adopted and are considering adopting regulations to impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, well construction, and operational requirements in relation to hydraulic fracturing activities or otherwise delay or temporarily or permanently prohibit those activities. PaDEP, for example, stated in an October 2017 regulatory update document that it is developing proposed amendments to the state\u2019s well drilling, casing, cementing, operation, and plugging regulations. In addition to state laws, local land use enactments, such as city ordinances, zoning laws, and traffic regulations may restrict where gas well drilling, in general, or hydraulic fracturing in particular, may be conducted.\nWe believe that, in conducting hydraulic fracturing activities, we follow the applicable legal requirements and standard industry practices groundwater protection. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, certain governmental reviews, which are either completed, underway, or proposed, are focused on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. In December of 2016, for example, the EPA finalized a study regarding the potential effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. In the study, the EPA found, among other things, that injecting hydraulic fracturing fluids into gas wells that are not structurally and mechanically adequate can allow gases or liquids to migrate into groundwater resources. Other government agencies have likewise evaluated or are evaluating various aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These types of studies, depending on the degree to which they are pursued and their results and findings, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nThe EPA, in addition, has utilized existing authority under the SDWA, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and the Clean Air Act to investigate, order actions, and pursue penalties against operators whose hydraulic fracturing or other gas and Oil activities allegedly impacted the air, soil, or water.\nTo our knowledge, there have been no citations or contamination of potable drinking water arising from our fracturing operations. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our general liability, excess liability, and pollution insurance policies would cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies.\nIf our access to markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income, and ultimately our ability to retain our leases. Our ability to sell our natural gas, NGLs, and oil (including ethane) and/or receive market prices for our natural gas, NGLs, and oil may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory natural gas, NGL, and oil transportation arrangements may hinder our access to natural gas, NGL, and oil markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our natural gas, NGL, and oil production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of natural gas, NGLs, and oil and the proximity of reserves to pipelines, and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. Our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by other means, such as trucking, or requiring compression facilities. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our natural gas, NGLs, or oil may have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production.\nIf drilling in the Marcellus Shale and other areas of the Appalachian Basin continues to be successful, the amount of natural gas being produced by us and others could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in these areas. If this occurs, it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built. Certain pipeline projects that are planned for these areas may not occur. In addition, capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our gas to interstate pipelines. In such event, we might be required to shut in our wells to await a pipeline connection or capacity and/or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our natural gas, NGL, and oil production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues, or strikes or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow.\nWe cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we own an interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operations of these properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s:\n\u2022\nnature and timing of drilling and operational activities;\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\nthe approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nselection of suitable technology.\nAll of the value of our production and reserves is concentrated in the Appalachian Basin. Because of this concentration, any production problems or changes in assumptions affecting our proved reserve estimates or other risks related to this area could have a material adverse impact to our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, all of our estimated proved reserves and net production came from the Appalachian Basin. If mechanical problems, weather conditions, or other events impacting the region were to curtail a substantial portion of the production in the Appalachian Basin or otherwise adversely impact regional processing, transportation, governmental regulation, or labor matters, our results of operation would be adversely affected. Also, if ultimate production associated with our properties in the Appalachian Basin is less than our estimated reserves, or changes in pricing, cost, or recovery assumptions in the area results in a downward revision of any estimated reserves in these properties, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompetition in the natural gas, NGL, and oil industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing natural gas, NGLs, and oil and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical, and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas and oil properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting, and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital.\nWe are a party to several transportation, marketing and processing agreements which commit us to payment obligations over the next five years. We may incur substantial shortfall costs if we are unable to meet our volume commitments or otherwise sell this capacity rights to third parties.\nIn the normal course of business we enter in to transportation, marketing and processing agreements to ensure future market outlets for our natural gas, NGLs, and oil. These agreements commit us to future obligations to be paid regardless of volumes produced. As of December 31, 2017, we were a party to several transportation, marketing, and processing agreements which commit us to approximately $243.4 million over the next five years. If we are unable to meet our volume commitments or otherwise convey our capacity rights to third parties we may incur substantial costs associated with these contracts without corresponding natural gas, NGLs, and oil sales.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our natural gas, NGLs, and oil operations, and we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks that we face.\nWe maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses to protect against the risks we face. We do not carry business interruption insurance. We may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, it is not possible to insure fully against pollution and environmental risks.\nLosses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing natural gas, NGLs, and oil, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination and soil contamination;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions;\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, then that accident or other event could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner, or feasibility of doing business.\nThe exploration, development, production and sale natural gas, NGLs, and oil are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Such regulation includes requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations. Other activities subject to regulation are:\n\u2022\nthe location and spacing of wells;\n\u2022\nthe unitization and pooling of properties;\n\u2022\nthe method of drilling and completing wells;\n\u2022\nthe surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;\n\u2022\nthe plugging and abandoning of wells;\n\u2022\nthe disposal of fluids used or other wastes generated in connection with our drilling operations;\n\u2022\nthe marketing, transportation and reporting of production; and\n\u2022\nthe valuation and payment of royalties.\nUnder these laws, we could be subject to claims for personal injury or property damages, including natural resource damages, which may result from the impacts of our operations. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs of compliance. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations, or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must obtain governmental permits and approvals for our drilling and midstream operations, which can be a costly and time consuming process, which may result in delays and restrictions on our operations.\nRegulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance. Requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of our exploration or production operations. For example, we are often required to prepare and present to federal, state, or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of natural gas or oil may have on the environment. Further, the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Accordingly, the permits we need may not be issued, or if issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably.\nOur operations expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters.\nOur natural gas, NGLs, and oil operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; impose restrictions on withdrawals from surface water resources; establish\nerosion and sediment control requirements for well pads and access roads; restrict the types, quantities, and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with our drilling and production activities; govern the handling and disposal of waste materials; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, including the habitat of threatened and endangered species; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities. Under existing environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from our operations, or whether our operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas, NGLs, and oil that we produce.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) present a danger to public health and the environment because those emissions are contributing to warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic conditions. Based on these findings, the EPA, under the Clean Air Act, has begun adopting regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs. The EPA, for example, adopted a set of rules that requires a reduction in GHG emissions from motor vehicles and another set of rules that regulates GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules that require monitoring and reporting on GHG emissions from specified sources, including petroleum refineries and certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these reporting requirements.\nThe EPA, in addition, issued regulations in 2012, which it amended in 2013 and 2014, known as \u201cNSPS OOOO,\u201d which require operators of new and modified hydraulically-fractured gas wells to use special techniques (known as \u201cgreen completions\u201d) to reduce emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (\u201cVOCs\u201d) from the wells. On May 12, 2016, the EPA issued regulations (effective August 2, 2016), known as \u201cNSPS OOOOa,\u201d which built on the NSPS OOOO standards by directly regulating methane and VOC emissions from various types of new and modified oil and gas sources. Some of those sources were already regulated under NSPS OOOO, while others, like pneumatic pumps, were covered for the first time. The EPA, however, is now planning to reconsider OOOOa\u2019s requirements for (i) monitoring for fugitive emissions (i.e., leaks), (ii) using professional engineers to certify closed vent systems, and (iii) pneumatic pumps that are used at well sites. It is also planning to stay or postpone the effective dates of those requirements while it reconsiders them. On February 23, 2018, moreover, the EPA amended OOOOa to remove certain requirements for sources of fugitive emissions to be repaired during unscheduled or emergency shutdowns.\nSeparately, on October 20, 2016, the EPA finalized Control Techniques Guidelines to reduce emissions from a number of existing (as opposed to new or modified) oil and gas sources that are located in certain ozone-sensitive areas, including Pennsylvania. These guidelines will lead to regulations that directly address VOC emissions and have the incidental effect of reducing methane emissions. The implementation deadline for the regulations is January 1, 2021. On March 2, 2018, however, the EPA proposed to withdrawal the Control Techniques Guidelines.\nIn 2018, moreover, PaDEP is expected to finalize a new general permit (\u201cGP-5A\u201d) for air pollutant emissions from sources at new or modified gas well sites and certain remote pigging stations. Under the permit, methane, VOC, and hazardous air pollutant (\u201cHAP\u201d) emissions from certain sources would need to be controlled, using leading technologies, if uncontrolled potential emissions from those sources would exceed certain limits (e.g., 200 tons per year for methane). GP-5A would also include special requirements for well drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations, well completion operations, and wellbore liquids unloading operations. And, it would impose certain leak detection and repair (\u201cLDAR\u201d) requirements, which would be more stringent than the ones that NSPS OOOOa imposes.\nAlso, Congress has from time to time considered bills to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states already have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The adoption of any legislation or regulation that requires reporting on GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant added costs to reduce emissions of GHGs or could adversely affect demand for the natural gas, NGLs, and oil we produce. Finally, some scientists have concluded that the increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate change that could have\nsignificant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation by Congress and related regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments, particularly swaps, to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Act, was enacted in 2010. The Act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including certain natural gas and oil transactions involving swaps. In particular, the Act includes general requirements that certain standardized transactions involving swaps be cleared and exchange-traded and, that parties post collateral for non-cleared swap transactions. At this time, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, has not yet required natural gas and oil swaps to be cleared and exchange-traded, although it has adopted clearing mandates for certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps on broad-based stock indices. Further, the Act provides for an exception from the clearing and exchange-trading requirement for swap transactions entered into by commercial end-users, a category of non-financial entities that includes Rex Energy, provided such transactions hedge or mitigate commercial risk and the party notifies the CFTC how it generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared swaps. While the CFTC and other federal agencies have adopted, and continue to adopt, numerous regulations pursuant to the Act, certain of the key concepts and defined terms under the Act have not yet been delineated by rules and regulations. In February 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to meet with various agencies that oversee and implement the Act\u2019s regulations to find areas to be amended. That review has been concluded, but it is unclear what regulations or parts of the Act will be most likely to change, if any. As a consequence, it is difficult to predict the aggregate effect the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder may have on our hedging activities. Whether we are required to submit our swap transactions for clearing or post collateral with respect to such transaction will depend on the final rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC. Even if the regulators do not require clearing or posting collateral, a counterparty to a particular swap may require posting of collateral. If we are subject to such requirements, significant liquidity issues could result by reducing our ability to use cash or other assets posted as collateral for investment or other corporate purposes. A requirement to post cash or other assets as collateral could also limit our ability to execute strategic hedges, which may result in increased commodity price uncertainty and volatility in our future cash flows. The Act and related regulations currently also require us to comply with certain futures and swaps position limits and new recordkeeping requirements and possibly new reporting requirements, and also could require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The Act and related regulations could also materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.\nEnactment of a Pennsylvania impact fee and severance tax on natural gas could adversely impact our results of existing operations and the economic viability of exploiting new gas drilling and production opportunities in Pennsylvania.\nIn February 2012, Pennsylvania implemented an impact fee. The fee is imposed on all unconventional wells that are drilled in the Pennsylvania counties that elected to impose it. The fee, which changes from year to year, is based on the average annual price of natural gas, determined by the NYMEX price, as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last trading day of each calendar month. For a given unconventional, horizontal well, the fee is initially imposed in the year after the well is spudded and then imposed annually for 15 years. There can be no assurance that the impact fee will remain as it is currently structured or that new or additional fees of its type will not be imposed.\nHistorically, Pennsylvania has not imposed a severance tax in connection with the extraction of natural gas. Since 2008, however, in light of deficits in the state\u2019s budget and the increasing exploration of the Marcellus Shale, a number of severance tax bills have been introduced in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, moreover, the Pennsylvania governor proposed state budgets that included proposals for a new severance tax that would be imposed in addition to the impact fee (the proposed tax rate was 6.5% in 2016 and 2017 and is variable, based on natural gas market prices, in 2018). Although no such proposal has yet been enacted into law, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to additional severance or similar taxes in the future.\nChanges to the current impact fee, or the imposition of a new severance tax, could negatively affect our future cash flows and financial condition.\nFuture economic conditions in the U.S. and global markets may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.\nThe U.S. and other world economies continue to experience the after-effects of a global recession and credit market crisis. More volatility may occur before a sustainable growth rate is achieved either domestically or globally. Even if such growth rate is achieved, such a rate may be lower than the U.S. and international economies have experienced in the past. Global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including for oil and natural gas. A lower future economic growth rate will result in decreased demand for our natural gas, NGLs, and oil production as well as lower commodity prices, which will reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of purchasers for a substantial portion of our revenue. The inability of one or more of our purchasers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of purchasers. Approximately 78.6% of our commodity sales from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 were to three customers, BP Energy Company, MarkWest Liberty Midstream Resources, LLC, and Shell Trading (US) Company, with BP Energy Company, our largest single customer, accounting for 47.0%. If we were unable to continue to sell our natural gas, NGLs and oil to these key customers, or to offset any reduction in sales to these customers by additional sales to our other customers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These companies may not provide the same level of our revenue in the future for a variety of reasons, including their lack of funding, a strategic shift on their part in moving to different geographic areas in which we do not operate or our failure to meet their performance criteria. We also are subject to risk from loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by these significant customers. The loss of all or a significant part of our revenue from our significant customers would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may suffer if we lose key personnel.\nOur operations depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management. Our business or prospects could be adversely affected if any of these persons do not continue in their management role with us and we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements. Additionally, we do not carry key person insurance for any of our executive officers or senior management.\nOur future acquisitions may yield revenue or production that varies significantly from our projections.\nIn pursuing potential acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, we will assess the potential recoverable reserves, future natural gas and oil prices, operating costs, potential liabilities, and other factors relating to the properties. Our assessments are necessarily inexact, and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. Our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities. We may not inspect every well, and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well. If problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems. Any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful, and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly changed the Internal Revenue Code, reducing the Federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, allowing for bonus depreciation on certain qualified property, eliminating the alternative minimum tax for corporate taxpayers, adding a new limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and adding a limitation on the deduction for net operating losses. The Tax Act also authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations with respect to the new provisions. We are still in the process of analyzing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and its possible effects on the Company. We cannot predict how the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, regulations, or other guidance issued under it or conforming or non-conforming state tax rules might affect us or our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that U.S. tax laws, including the corporate income tax rate, will not undergo significant changes in the near future.\nNew technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete.\nThe natural gas and oil industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, competitors may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. One or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a\ntimely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards, our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe outcome of litigation in which we have been named as a defendant is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nWe are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are subject to various other claims, demands and investigations. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims, demands, or investigations could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe natural gas and oil industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, and processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of its vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of its business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. We do not maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has concurred with our determination that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe recently have incurred significant operating and net losses and may continue to incur net operating losses. Without additional sources of capital or a significant restructuring of our balance sheet, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which means that we may be unable to continue operations for the foreseeable future or realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph with respect to this uncertainty in its report that is included with our financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such an opinion may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock and may otherwise limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities or otherwise. Further, the perception that we may be unable to continue as a going concern may impede our ability to raise additional funds or operate our business due to concerns with respect to our ability to discharge our contractual obligations.\nWe have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Without additional capital or a significant restructuring of our balance sheet, however, we may be unable to continue as a viable entity, in which case our stockholders may lose all or some of their investment in us.\nOur stock price could be volatile, which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In particular, the market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of other energy companies, has been and may continue to be highly volatile. During 2017, the sales price of our stock ranged from a low of $0.32 per share (on April 21, 2017, prior to our one-for-ten reverse stock split on May 15, 2017) to a high of $4.71 per share (on May 15, 2017, the effective date of our one-for-ten reverse stock split). In 2018, through April 11, 2018, our stock has traded as low as $0.53 per share (on April 11, 2018). Factors such as announcements concerning balance sheet restructuring transactions that we may pursue, our delisting and deregistration from the Nasdaq Capital Market, changes in prices of oil and natural gas, the success of our acquisition, exploration and development activities, the availability of capital, and economic and other external factors, as well as period-to-period fluctuations and our financial results, may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are no longer eligible to use registration statements on Form S-3, which could impair our ability to raise capital.\nAs a result of our historically not declaring and paying regular quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock, for a period of five quarters, as of the date of this report, we are not eligible to use registration statements on Form S-3. As a result, we cannot use registration statements on Form S-3 to register resales of our securities until we have filed an annual report on Form 10-K including audited financial statements covering the period in which the failure to pay preferred dividends is rectified. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to offer and sell securities while utilizing shelf registration statements on Form S-3 if our public float is below $75 million. As a result, we may not be eligible during any 12-month period to use registration statements on Form S-3 for primary offerings of securities having an aggregate market value of more than one-third of our public float, even though we otherwise would regain the ability to use the form for resale registration statements. Any limitations on our ability to use shelf registration statements may harm our ability to raise the capital we need in an efficient manner or on acceptable terms. Under these circumstances, until we are again eligible to use Form S-3, we will be required to use a registration statement on Form S-1 to register securities with the SEC or issue such securities in a private placement, which could increase the cost of raising capital in the event that we do so.\nWe may issue additional common stock in the future, which would dilute our existing stockholders.\nIn the future, we may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, including shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders. We are authorized under our certificate of incorporation to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, preferences, and rights as may be determined by our board of directors. In the future, we may seek stockholder approval to increase our authorized capital. As of April 11, 2018, there were 10,708,287 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and 3,987 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding.\nWe have issued in the past, and we may continue to issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock to pay accrued dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of our Series A Preferred Stock, in connection with public offerings, private placements, the hiring of personnel, acquisitions, for capital raising purposes. For example, we issued shares of our common stock on November 15, 2017 and February 15, 2018 to pay quarterly dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock. Future issuances of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances could occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors and the ownership of our common stock by our board of directors, including our Chairman, and our executive officers, who collectively beneficially own approximately 7.2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of March 31, 2018, could discourage a potential takeover attempt.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us and changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws without further stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for advance notice of director nominations to our board of directors and for proposing other matters to be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our Chairman, by a majority of our board of directors, by our Chief Executive Officer or by our President; and\n\u2022\nallowing our directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on the board of directors, including vacancies resulting from removal or enlargement of the board of directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from engaging in business combinations, such as mergers or consolidations, with us.\nAs of March 31, 2018, our board of directors, including Lance T. Shaner, our Chairman, and our executive officers collectively own approximately 7.2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nThe provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law, and the ownership of our common stock by our Chairman and other executive officers, could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and investment opportunities. In addition, our term loan credit facility limits the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders. Accordingly, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur. In addition, the ability of stockholders to realize any appreciation that may occur is subject to the liquidity of our common stock at a given time.\nWe are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends, liquidation rights, or voting rights. If we issue additional preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that our stockholders might sell shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. We cannot\npredict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities by our stockholders would have on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to list our common stock on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or on any securities exchange.\nOur common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, where it had been listed since December 2016 after previously being listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. On April 3, 2018, we received a Staff Determination Letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that, based on our continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b), our common stock would be suspended from trading on Nasdaq at the opening of business on April 12, 2018, and a Form 25-NSE would be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would remove our common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq, in each case unless we requested an appeal before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. We did not appeal this determination and the time period in which to appeal has lapsed. The delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could negatively impact us by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) preventing or limiting our access to public capital markets; and (iv) impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to effectively attract, motivate and retain our employees.\nFollowing the delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB or OTC Markets Group\u2019s Pink marketplace. Trading on the OTCBB or Pink marketplace may occur only if a market maker applies to quote our common stock and we are current in our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Once our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that a market maker will apply to quote our common stock or that our common stock then will be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB or the Pink marketplace.\nAlthough we may apply to list our common stock on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards, including the minimum per share price and minimum capitalization requirements, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on either of those or any other trading venue. Until such time as we would qualify for listing on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or another trading venue, our common stock may trade on quotation on the OTCBB or OTC Markets Group\u2019s Pink marketplace or another over-the-counter quotation system where an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In addition, rules promulgated by the SEC impose various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities that fail to meet certain criteria set forth in those rules to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, these rules may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the liquidity of our common stock. It would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. We cannot provide any assurance that an active public market for our common stock will be available or remain sustained in the future.", "PERMNO": 92205, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "REXXQ"}
