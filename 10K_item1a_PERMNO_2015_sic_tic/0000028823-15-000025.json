{"cik": "28823", "company": "DIEBOLD INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\n(dollars in thousands)\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K because they could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. The risk factors highlighted below are not the only ones we face. If any of these events actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be negatively affected.\nWe caution the reader to keep these risk factors in mind and refrain from attributing undue certainty to any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nDemand for and supply of our services and products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our operating results.\nNumerous factors may affect the demand for and supply of our services and products, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the market acceptance of our services and products;\n\u2022\ncustomer and competitor consolidation;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer preferences;\n\u2022\ndeclines in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in environmental regulations that would limit our ability to service and sell products in specific markets;\n\u2022\nmacro-economic factors affecting banks, credit unions and other financial institutions may lead to cost-cutting efforts by customers, which could cause us to lose current or potential customers or achieve less revenue per customer; and\n\u2022\navailability of purchased products.\nIf any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of our services and products could suffer, and which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIncreased energy and raw material costs could reduce our income.\nEnergy prices, particularly petroleum prices, are cost drivers for our business. In recent years, the price of petroleum has been highly volatile, particularly due to the unstable political conditions in the Middle East and increasing international demand from emerging markets. Price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as those increases that may occur from climate change legislation or other environmental mandates, may continue to increase our cost of operations. Any increase in the costs of energy would also increase our transportation costs.\nThe primary raw materials in our FSS, security, election and lottery systems product solutions are steel, plastics and electronic parts and components. The majority of our raw materials are purchased from various local, regional and global suppliers pursuant to supply contracts. However, the price of these materials can fluctuate under these contracts in tandem with the pricing of raw materials.\nAlthough we attempt to pass on higher energy and raw material costs to our customers, it is often not possible given the competitive markets in which we operate.\nOur business may be affected by general economic conditions, cyclicality and uncertainty and could be adversely affected during economic downturns.\nDemand for our services and products is affected by general economic conditions and the business conditions of the industries in which we sell our services and products. The business of most of our customers, particularly our financial institution customers, is, to varying degrees, cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns. Under difficult economic conditions, customers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our services and products. This risk is magnified for capital goods purchases such as ATMs and physical security products. In addition, downturns in our customers' industries, even during periods of strong general economic conditions, could adversely affect the demand for our services and products, and our sales and operating results.\nIn particular, continuing economic difficulties in the global markets have led to an economic recession in many of the markets in which we operate. As a result of these difficulties and other factors, including new or increased regulatory burdens, financial institutions have failed and may continue to fail, resulting in a loss of current or potential customers, or deferred or canceled orders, including orders previously placed. Any customer deferrals or cancellations could materially affect our sales and operating results.\nAdditionally, the unstable political conditions in the Middle East or the sovereign debt concerns of certain countries could lead to further financial, economic and political instability, and this could lead to an additional deterioration in general economic conditions.\nWe may be unable to achieve, or may be delayed in achieving, our cost-cutting initiatives, and this may adversely affect our operating results and cash flow.\nWe have launched a number of cost-cutting initiatives, including as part of Diebold 2.0 and other restructuring initiatives, to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs. Although we have achieved a substantial amount of annual cost savings associated with these cost-cutting initiatives, we may be unable to sustain the cost savings that we have achieved. In addition, if we are unable to achieve, or have any unexpected delays in achieving, additional cost savings, our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected. Even if we meet our goals as a result of these initiatives, we may not receive the expected financial benefits of these initiatives.\nWe face competition that could adversely affect our sales and financial condition.\nAll phases of our business are highly competitive. Some of our products are in direct competition with similar or alternative products provided by our competitors. We encounter competition in price, delivery, service, performance, product innovation, product recognition and quality.\nBecause of the potential for consolidation in any market, our competitors may become larger, which could make them more efficient and permit them to be more price-competitive. Increased size could also permit them to operate in wider geographic areas and enhance their abilities in other areas such as research and development and customer service. As a result, this could also reduce our profitability.\nWe expect that our competitors will continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced services and products. This could cause a decline in market acceptance of our services and products. In addition, our competitors could cause a reduction in the prices for some of our services and products as a result of intensified price competition. Also, we may be unable to effectively anticipate and react to new entrants in the marketplace competing with our services and products.\nCompetitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers. An inability to compete successfully could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows in any given period.\nAdditional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. If we change our intention to repatriate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments residing in international tax jurisdictions, there could be further negative impact on foreign and domestic taxes. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could affect the valuation of our net deferred tax assets. Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our income tax exposures.\nAdditionally, our future results could be adversely affected by the results of indirect tax audits and examinations, and continuing assessments of our indirect tax exposures. For example, in August 2012, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries was notified of a tax assessment of approximately R$270,000, including penalties and interest, regarding certain Brazilian federal indirect taxes for 2008 and 2009. The assessment alleges improper importation of certain components into the country's free trade zone that would nullify certain indirect tax incentives. Although we received a favorable administrative level decision, the matter remains subject to ongoing administrative proceedings and appeals that could negatively impact the recent administrative level decision, and could also negatively impact Brazilian federal indirect taxes in other years that remain open under statute. It is reasonably possible that we could be required to pay taxes, penalties and interest related to this matter or other open years, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn international markets, we compete with local service providers that may have competitive advantages.\nIn a number of international markets, especially those in AP and LA, we face substantial competition from local service providers that offer competing services and products. Some of these companies may have a dominant market share in their territories and may be owned by local stakeholders. This could give them a competitive advantage. Local providers of competing services and products may also have a substantial advantage in attracting customers in their country due to more established branding in that country, greater knowledge with respect to the tastes and preferences of customers residing in that country and/or their focus on a single market. As a U.S. based multi-national corporation, we must ensure our compliance with both U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements.\nBecause our operations are conducted worldwide, they are affected by risks of doing business abroad.\nWe generate a significant percentage of revenue from operations conducted outside the United States. Revenue from international operations amounted to approximately 56.1 percent in 2014, 52.3 percent in 2013 and 48.7 percent in 2012 of total revenue during these respective years.\nAccordingly, international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly in China (renminbi), Brazil (real) and EMEA (euro);\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022\nthe failure of foreign governments to abide by international agreements and treaties;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of duties and tariffs;\n\u2022\nimport and export controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental policies and regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nensuring our compliance with U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);\n\u2022\nlabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of product acceptance by different cultures;\n\u2022\nthe risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing joint ventures with foreign partners;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including repatriation of profits.\nAny of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our services and products or decreasing the prices at which we can sell our services and products, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or operating results. We may not be able to continue to operate in compliance with applicable customs, currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject. In addition, these laws or regulations may be modified in the future, and we may not be able to operate in compliance with those modifications.\nAdditionally, there are ongoing concerns regarding the short- and long-term stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for a variety of individual countries. These concerns could lead individual countries to revert, or threaten to revert, to their former local currencies, which could lead to the dissolution of the euro. Should this occur, the assets we hold in a country that re-introduces its local currency could be significantly devalued. Furthermore, the dissolution of the euro could cause significant volatility and disruption to the global economy, which could impact our financial results. Finally, if it were necessary for us to conduct our business in additional currencies, we would be subjected to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into U.S. dollars.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. The FCPA also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the SEC.\nOur employees and agents are required to comply with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental and commercial corruption to some degree, and strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, may not be subject to the FCPA and may\nfollow local customs and practices. Accordingly, such companies may be more likely to engage in activities prohibited by the FCPA, which could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to compete for business in such countries.\nDespite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics, we cannot ensure that our policies and procedures will always protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in financial penalties, debarment from government contracts and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our business opportunities in select geographies have been or may be adversely affected by the settlement of previously-disclosed FCPA matter with the U.S. government in late 2013. Some countries in which we do business may also initiate their own reviews and impose penalties, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions. We could also face third-party claims in connection with this matter or as a result of the outcome of the current or any future government reviews. Our disclosure, internal review and any current or future governmental review of this matter could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets.\nWe may expand operations into international markets in which we may have limited experience or rely on business partners.\nWe continually look to expand our services and products into international markets. We have currently developed, through joint ventures, strategic investments, subsidiaries and branch offices, service and product offerings in more than 90 countries outside of the United States. As we expand into new international markets, we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets. In other instances, we may rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets. Certain international markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting our services and products, and our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment. Further, violations of laws by our foreign business partners, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAn inability to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our operating results, business and prospects.\nAs part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing arrangements, and we enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates, successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. Integration and other risks of these transactions can be more pronounced in larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally. This may put us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and profitability.\nIntegration issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. The challenges involved in integration include:\n\u2022\ncombining service and product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;\n\u2022\nconvincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus, preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers or service providers(which could result in additional obligations to address customer uncertainty), and coordinating service, sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u2022\nconsolidating and rationalizing corporate information technology infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code;\n\u2022\nminimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\npersuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, integrating employees into our Company, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;\n\u2022\ncoordinating and combining administrative, service, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\nachieving savings from supply chain and administration integration.\nWe evaluate and enter into these types of transactions on an ongoing basis. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any transaction, and the time frame for achieving benefits of a transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, suppliers or other third parties. In addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for these transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to achieve contractual obligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable.\nManaging these types of transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. These transactions could result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, in-process research and development charges, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation regulatory compliance and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans. Moreover, we could incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with these transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing shareholders, or borrow funds, which could affect our financial condition and potentially our credit ratings. Any prior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with a transaction could adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and such transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction and the risk that an announced transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment community\u2019s expectations.\nWe have a significant amount of long-term assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, and any future impairment charges could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe review long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference. Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $171,974 of goodwill. We assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The Company\u2019s five reporting units are defined as Domestic and Canada, Brazil, LA, AP and EMEA. The techniques used in our qualitative and quantitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to change; although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reflect market conditions forecast at the assessment date. Any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods.\nSystem security risks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could adversely affect revenue, increase costs, and harm our reputation and stock price.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our own confidential information or that of our customers, corrupt data, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. A network security breach could be particularly harmful if it remained undetected for an extended period of time. Groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks, or other coordinated attacks, that may cause service outages or other interruptions. We could incur significant expenses in addressing problems created by network security breaches, such as the expenses of deploying additional personnel, enhancing or implementing new protection measures, training employees or hiring consultants. Further, such corrective measures may later prove inadequate. Moreover, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our services and products could cause significant reputational harm, causing us to lose existing or potential customers. Reputational damage could also result in diminished investor confidence. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may also lead to claims against us. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. We could also incur significant expenses in connection with customers\u2019 system failures.\nIn addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts\nto address these problems could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service that could impede sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems, and transitioning data and other aspects of the process could be expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact the ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes and, in addition, could adversely impact our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Delayed sales, lower margins, lost customers or diminished investor confidence resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect financial results, stock price and reputation.\nAn inability to attract, retain and motivate key employees could harm current and future operations.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, professional, administrative, technical, sales, marketing and information technology support positions. We also must keep employees focused on our strategies and goals. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in these areas can be intense. The failure to hire or loss of key employees could have a significant impact on our operations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments, or to pay dividends.\nOur cash flows from operations depend primarily on sales and service margins. To develop new service and product technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain service and product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and service and product technology. In addition to cash provided from operations, we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing. Despite our Diebold 2.0 strategy, depending upon general market conditions or other factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments, or to continue to pay dividends, either in whole or in part. In addition, any tightening of the credit markets may limit our ability to obtain alternative sources of cash to fund our operations.\nNew service and product developments may be unsuccessful.\nWe are constantly looking to develop new services and products that complement or leverage the underlying design or process technology of our traditional service and product offerings. We make significant investments in service and product technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new software-led services and product development over the next several years. There can be no assurance that our service and product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost effectively develop or manufacture these new services and products, that we will be able to successfully market these services and products or that margins generated from sales of these services and products will recover costs of development efforts.\nAn adverse determination that our services, products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAs is common in any high technology industry, others have asserted from time to time, and may assert in the future, that our services, products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. A court determination that our services, products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our services, products and/or manufacturing processes. We are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. Any of the foregoing could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nChanges in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, compliance costs and enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. For example, under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d for issuers for which such \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are necessary to the functionality or product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by that issuer. The metals covered by the rules include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, commonly referred to as \u201c3TG.\u201d Our suppliers may use some or all of these materials in their production processes. The SEC's rules require us to perform supply chain due diligence on every member of our supply chain, including the mine owner and operator. Global supply chains can have multiple layers, thus the costs of complying with these requirements could be substantial. These requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Compliance costs and the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. As another example, the customs authority in Thailand has unilaterally changed its position with respect to its obligations under the World Trade Organization\u2019s International Technology Agreement (ITA), which provides duty-free treatment for the importation of ATMs into Thailand from other member countries that have signed the ITA, which includes imports from the United States.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nCertain provisions of our charter documents, including provisions limiting the ability of shareholders to raise matters at a meeting of shareholders without giving advance notice and permitting cumulative voting, may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Board of Directors and may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management. This could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Additionally, Ohio corporate law provides that certain notice and informational filings and special shareholder meeting and voting procedures must be followed prior to consummation of a proposed \u201ccontrol share acquisition,\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. Assuming compliance with the prescribed notice and information filings, a proposed control share acquisition may be made only if, at a special meeting of shareholders, the acquisition is approved by both a majority of our voting power represented at the meeting and a majority of the voting power remaining after excluding the combined voting power of the \u201cinterested shares,\u201d as defined in the Ohio Revised Code. The application of these provisions of the Ohio Revised Code also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.\nAny actions or other governmental investigations or proceedings related to or arising from the matters that resulted in our previous settlements could result in substantial costs to defend enforcement or other related actions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe Company had previously reached an agreement in 2009 with the staff of the SEC to settle civil charges stemming from the staff's enforcement inquiry and an agreement with the staff of the SEC and Department of Justice to settle the FCPA review in 2013. We could incur substantial additional costs to defend and resolve third-party litigation or other governmental actions, investigations or proceedings arising out of, or related to, the completed investigations or these settlements. The diversion of resources to address issues arising out of any such third-party or governmental actions may harm our business, operating results and financial condition in the future.\nOur ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nManagement identified previous control deficiencies during 2013 and 2012 that were disclosed as material weaknesses. These material weaknesses have been remediated as of December 31, 2014. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.\nIf we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements. As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and the market value of our securities and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures. In addition, perceptions of our Company among customers, lenders, investors, securities analysts and others could also be adversely affected.\nWe can give no assurances that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. In addition, although we have been successful historically in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nLow investment performance by our domestic pension plan assets may result in an increase to our net pension liability and expense, which may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and divert funds from other potential uses.\nWe sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover certain eligible employees. Our pension expense and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations.\nA significant market downturn could occur in future periods resulting in a decline in the funded status of our pension plans and actual asset returns to be below the assumed rate of return used to determine pension expense. If return on plan assets in future periods perform below expectations, future pension expense will increase. Further, as a result of global economic instability in recent years, our pension plan investment portfolio has been volatile.\nWe establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed income investments. We match the projected cash flows of our pension plans against those generated by high-quality corporate bonds. The yield of the resulting bond portfolio provides a basis for the selected discount rate. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a decrease in the discount rate would increase the future pension expense.\nBased on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates, including investment returns and interest rates, we plan to make contributions of $18,648 to our pension plans in 2015. Changes in the current assumptions and estimates could result in contributions in years beyond 2015 that are greater than the projected 2015 contributions required. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.\nOur businesses are subject to inherent risks, some for which we maintain third-party insurance and some for which we self-insure. We may incur losses and be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our businesses. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from un-insured or under-insured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments. We also may incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations.\nOur assumptions used to determine our self-insurance liability could be wrong and materially impact our business.\nWe evaluate our self-insurance liability based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. However, if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses.", "PERMNO": 40440, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "DBD"}
