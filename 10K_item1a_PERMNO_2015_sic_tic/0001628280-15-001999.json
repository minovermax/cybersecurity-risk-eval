{"cik": "1041859", "company": "Childrens Place, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvestors in the Company should consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained herein:\nWe may suffer adverse business consequences if we are unable to anticipate and respond to merchandise trends, marketing and promotional trends or customer shopping patterns.\nThe apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer preferences. Our success depends in part on the ability of our design and merchandising team to anticipate and respond to these changes. Our design, manufacturing and distribution process generally takes up to one year, during which time fashion trends and consumer preferences may further change.\nIn addition, marketing technology is evolving rapidly. We market our brand through various means, including customer research, email, direct mailings, advertising, promotional events, and in-store signage. Our ability to deliver a high customer experience that retains our current customer base and acquires new customers is dependent on our being able to anticipate new innovations in technology and our ability to use them to increase our brand value.\nNew technological innovations are also expanding ways that retail customers shop, including in-store, online, using tablets, mobile devices and other means. Our success depends in part on the ability of our merchandising and marketing teams to anticipate and respond to these innovations. Our failure to anticipate, identify or respond to these innovations could adversely affect customer acceptance of our products resulting in lower sales, increased inventory levels and/or lower margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in our Comparable Retail Sales and/or quarterly results of operations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nNumerous factors affect our Comparable Retail Sales and quarterly results including, among others, unseasonable weather conditions, merchandise assortment, retail prices, fashion trends, mall traffic, number of visits to our e-commerce site, the retail sales environment, calendar shifts of holidays or seasonal periods, birth rate fluctuations, timing of promotional events, macro-economic conditions and our success in executing our business strategies.\nUnseasonably cold weather over a prolonged period of time and the occurrence of frequent or severe storms adversely affect our sales and therefore our Comparable Retail Sales. The nature of our target customer heightens the effects of bad weather on our sales. Our target customer is a value conscious, lower to middle income mother buying for infants and children based on need rather than based on fashion, trend or impulse. Therefore, for example, our target customer will not purchase warm weather spring clothing during an extended period of unseasonably cold weather occurring in what otherwise should be warmer weather months.\nOur Comparable Retail Sales and quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past due to the factors cited above, and we anticipate that they will continue to fluctuate in the future, particularly in the current difficult and highly competitive retail environment and continued weak economic conditions affecting our target customer, which may result in declines in consumer spending. The investment community follows Comparable Retail Sales and quarterly results closely and fluctuations in these results, or the failure of our results to meet investor expectations, may have a significant adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our business strategies.\nWe are continuously seeking new ways to further our brand recognition, develop and implement digital and omni-channel initiatives, expand our channels of distribution and geographical coverage, optimize our North American retail store fleet, and\nimprove our operational processes. Our failure to properly execute our plans, or identify alternative strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring Fiscal 2015, we plan to drive additional growth and profitability through our international and wholesale distribution channels. Consumer demand, behavior, taste and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and/or in the distribution channels through which our wholesale customers sell products and, as a result, sales of our products may not be successful or meet our expectations, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. We may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations and/or wholesaling operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems and other operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations.\nDuring Fiscal 2015, we will continue our store fleet optimization program, which is intended to increase profitability and return on our existing retail store fleet. Currently, it is planned that this program will close approximately 200 underperforming retail stores through fiscal 2017, which include 35 retail stores we closed in Fiscal 2014 and 41 retail stores we closed in Fiscal 2013. Failure to properly identify or measure underperforming retail stores, failure to achieve anticipated sales transfer rates among closed and remaining retail stores in a geographic region, and failure to properly identify and analyze customer segmentation and spending patterns could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to recognize an impairment charge when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that the asset\u2019s carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable over its estimated useful life, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. We have recognized impairment charges of $11.1 million in Fiscal 2014 and $29.6 million in Fiscal 2013.\nAny of the above risks, individually or in aggregation, could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA material disruption in, failure of, or inability to upgrade, our information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely heavily on various information systems to manage our complex operations, including our online business, management of our supply chain, inventory, point-of-sale processing in our stores, gift cards, our private label credit card, and various other processes and transactions. We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our IT systems. We are in the process of transforming our business by implementing new computer systems that will enhance our core merchandising, planning and allocation, sourcing, omni-channel capabilities, e-commerce platform and financial and accounting processes, including our implementation of certain planning and allocation, inventory management and pricing business management software which is expected to be completed in Fiscal 2015. Implementing new systems carries substantial risk, including failure to operate as designed, failure to properly integrate with other systems, potential loss of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, failure to implement appropriate security measures, lower customer satisfaction resulting in lost customers or sales, inability to deliver merchandise to our stores, inventory shortages, inventory levels in excess of customer demand, inability to meet the demands of our international franchise partners or our wholesale and retail customers, and the potential inability to meet reporting requirements. In addition, any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our current or new information systems could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, unreliable, corrupted, insufficient or inaccessible. Further, there is no assurance that a successfully implemented system will deliver any anticipated sales or margin improvements or other benefits to us. Risks associated with our information technology systems include:\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the failure of our information technology systems due to inadequate system capacity, security breaches, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in telephone service or power outages;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties for computer hardware and software, as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers;\n\u2022\nrapid technology changes; and\n\u2022\nconsumer privacy concerns and regulation.\nAny of these potential issues, individually or in aggregation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also rely on third-party vendors and outsourcing partners to design, program, implement, maintain and service our existing and planned information systems. Any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services in a timely fashion or any failure of these vendors to protect our personal or competitively sensitive data or to prevent the authorized access to such data, whether in their possession or through our information systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA privacy breach, through a cybersecurity incident or otherwise, or failure to comply with privacy laws could adversely affect our business.\nDespite our efforts and technology to secure our computer network, a targeted or random cyber-attack, acts of vandalism, hacking, rogue employees or infection by computer viruses or other malware may bypass our technology and breach our computer network resulting in a material disruption of our computer network and/or a loss of information valuable to our business, including without limitation customer or employee personal information. Any of the above cyber incidents may go undetected for a period of time which could result in materially adverse consequences. Despite our due diligence in selecting and monitoring third party vendors and partners, a similar breach to their computer networks may occur, leading to a material disruption of our computer network and/or a decrease in e-commerce sales and a loss of information valuable to our business, including but not limited to customer or employee personal information. Such a cyber-attack could result in any of the following:\n\u2022\ntheft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data, intellectual property or customer information, including personally identifiable information such as credit card information, email addresses, social security numbers, home addresses or health information;\n\u2022\noperational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our computer network and subsequent material clean-up and mitigation costs and activities;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity resulting in substantial reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers; and\n\u2022\nloss of sales generated through our e-commerce website.\nOur systems and procedures are required to meet the Payment Card Industry (\"PCI\") data security standards, which require periodic audits by independent third parties to assess compliance. Failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in substantial fines and the imposition of material restrictions on our ability to accept payment by credit or debit cards. There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy PCI security standards or to identify security issues in a timely fashion. In addition, PCI is controlled by a limited number of vendors who have the ability to impose changes in PCI's fee structure and operational requirements on us without negotiation. Such changes in fees and operational requirements may result in our failure to comply with PCI security standards, as well as significant unanticipated expenses.\nAny of the above risks, individually or in aggregation, could substantially damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines, and/or lawsuits, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although we carry cybersecurity insurance, in the event of a cyber incident, that insurance may not be extensive enough or adequate in amount to cover damages we may incur. Further, a significant breach of federal, state, provincial, local or international privacy laws could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe regard the protection of our customer, employee, and company data as critical. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Any breach involving this data could cause material harm to our reputation or result in substantial liability, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources.\nCertain activist shareholders have made, or indicated they will in the future make, strategic proposals, suggestions or requested changes concerning the Company's operations, strategy, management, businesses or other matters. Responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our common stock. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to the foregoing, and any such\nmatters may impact the value of the Company's common stock could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on our relationships with unaffiliated manufacturers, transportation companies, and independent agents. Our inability to maintain relationships with any of these entities, or the failure of any of their businesses, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities, and therefore, are dependent upon independent third parties for the manufacture of all of our products. Most of our products are currently manufactured to our specifications, pursuant to purchase orders, by approximately 105 independent manufacturers located primarily in Greater Asia. In Fiscal 2014, we sourced approximately 34% of our total goods from China, approximately 20% from Bangladesh, approximately 15% from Vietnam and approximately 8% from Indonesia. We did not source more than 6% of our total goods from any other country or region. We have no exclusive or long-term contracts with our manufacturers and compete with other companies for manufacturing facilities. We have reduced our reliance on the use of commissioned buying agents, and only use these commissioned agents for the sourcing of select product categories where we lack either technical competency in our own sourcing offices or when product volume is not sufficient to justify expanding our capabilities. Although we believe that we have the in-house capability to more efficiently source certain of our purchases, our inability to do so, or our inability to find adequate sources to support our current needs for merchandise and future growth, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to local law in the areas of worker safety (e.g. fire safety and building codes), worker rights of association, and social compliance and health and welfare requirements could result in accidents and practices that cause disruptions or delays in production and/or substantial harm to our reputation, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers through third parties to our distribution and fulfillment centers, our stores, our e-commerce customers and our international franchise partners and wholesale customers. Our operating results depend in large part on the orderly, timely and accurate operation of our receiving and distribution process, which depends, in part, on our manufacturers' adherence to shipping schedules and our third party providers\u2019 effective management of our domestic and international distribution facilities and capacity. Furthermore, it is possible that events beyond our control, such as political unrest, a terrorist or similar act, military action, strike, weather patterns, natural disaster, continuing government spending cuts or other disruption impacting the countries that we source from, could result in delays in delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers or our stores, international franchise partners and wholesale customers, or the fulfillment of e-commerce orders to our customer, or require us to incur additional costs in air freight to ensure timely delivery. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our internal agents, independent agents, principal manufacturers or freight operators experience negative financial consequences, our inability to use or find substitute providers to support our manufacturing and distribution needs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause we purchase our products internationally, our business is sensitive to risks associated with international business.\nVirtually all of our merchandise is purchased from foreign suppliers, including approximately 34% from China, approximately 20% from Bangladesh, approximately 15% from Vietnam and approximately 8% from Indonesia. As a result, we are subject to various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:\n\u2022\nforeign governmental regulations, including but not limited to changing requirements with regard to product safety, product testing, employment, taxation and language preference in course of dealing;\n\u2022\nthe failure of an unaffiliated manufacturer to comply with local laws, including labor laws, health and safety laws or ethical labor practices;\n\u2022\nfinancial or political instability;\n\u2022\nthe rising cost of doing business in particular countries, including China;\n\u2022\nfluctuation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies;\n\u2022\npressure from non-governmental organizations;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of foreign produced merchandise;\n\u2022\ndeveloping countries with less infrastructure;\n\u2022\nnew legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the import of our merchandise;\n\u2022\nimposition of duties, taxes, and other charges on imports;\n\u2022\nsignificant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations, political unrest or weather conditions;\n\u2022\ndisruption of imports by labor disputes (e.g., including at ports in the U.S.) and local business practices;\n\u2022\nregulations under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n\u2022\nincreased cost of transportation.\nIn an attempt to mitigate the above risks within any one country, we maintain relationships with many manufacturers in various countries. In order to maintain and/or reduce the cost of our merchandise, we have reduced and will continue to reduce production in China and have moved and will continue to move production into other developing countries. We cannot predict the effect that this, or the other factors noted above, in another country from which we import products could have on our business. If any of these factors rendered the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, or if our current foreign manufacturing sources ceased doing business with us or we cease doing business with them for any reason and we were unable to find alternative sources of supply, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, negatively impacting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe require our independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and our internal requirements. Our vendor code of conduct promotes ethical business practices and we monitor compliance with them; however we do not control these manufacturers, their labor practices, their health and safety practices, or from where they buy their raw materials. Any violation of labor, health, environmental, safety (eg. fire or building codes) or other laws by any of the independent manufacturers we use or any divergence of an independent manufacturer's labor practices from standards generally accepted as ethical in the United States and Canada could damage our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, negatively impacting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in the prices of raw materials, labor and energy could result in increased product and/or delivery costs.\nIncreases in the price of raw materials, including cotton, wool and other materials used in the production of fabric and accessories, as well as volatility and increases in labor and energy costs, could result in significant cost increases for our products as well as their distribution to our distribution centers, retail locations, international franchise partners and wholesale and retail customers. To the extent we are unable to offset any such increased costs through value engineering or price increases, such increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends upon the service and capabilities of our management team. Changes in management or in our organizational structure, or inadequate management, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOver the past few years, we had substantial changes in our management team, including key members of our senior management. While we believe our CEO and President has assembled a strong, experienced senior leadership team that will drive our strategic initiatives, our success is dependent on retaining key individuals within the organization to execute the Company\u2019s strategic plans. Leadership changes can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business or further turnover in our workforce or management team. Senior level management establishes the \u201ctone at the top\u201d by which an environment of ethical values, operating style and management philosophy is fostered. Changes in management, or inadequate management, could lead to an environment that lacks inspiration and/or a lack of commitment by our employees. The inability of our senior management team to maintain an adequate organizational structure and a proper \u201ctone at the top\u201d, or the inability to attract additional qualified managers or other personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProduct liability costs, related claims, and the cost of compliance with consumer product safety laws such as the CPSIA in the U.S. or the CCPSA in Canada or our inability to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to regulation by the CPSC in the U.S., Health Canada in Canada, and similar state, provincial and international regulatory authorities. Although we test the products sold in our stores, on our website, and to our international franchise partners and our wholesale customers, concerns about product safety, including but not limited to concerns about those manufactured in developing countries, may lead us to recall selected products, either voluntarily, or at the direction of a governmental authority, or may lead to a lack of consumer acceptance or loss of consumer trust. Product safety concerns, recalls, defects or errors could result in the rejection of our products by customers, damage to our reputation, lost sales, product liability litigation and increased costs, any or all of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe cost of compliance with current requirements and any future requirements of the CPSC, Health Canada or other state or international regulatory authorities, consumer product safety laws, including initiatives labeled as \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d and regulatory testing, certification, packaging, labeling and advertising and reporting requirements, or changes to existing laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any failure to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties, require us to recall products and harm our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to successfully manage our e-commerce business could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe successful operation of our e-commerce business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online order-taking and our fulfillment operations, and on our ability to provide a shopping experience that will generate orders and return visits to our site. Risks associated with our e-commerce business include:\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the failure of the computer systems that operate our website including, among others, inadequate system capacity, security breaches, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in telephone service or power outages;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties for computer hardware and software, as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers;\n\u2022\nrapid technology changes;\n\u2022\ncredit card fraud;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of sales from our physical stores;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable federal and state regulations;\n\u2022\nnegative reviews on social media;\n\u2022\nliability for online content; and\n\u2022\nconsumer privacy concerns and regulation.\nProblems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and could damage our reputation and brand.\nWe have a single distribution center serving the U.S., a single distribution center serving Canada and a single third-party warehouse provider serving the majority of shipments for our international franchise partners. Damage to, or a prolonged interruption of operations at, any of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur U.S. distribution center is located in Fort Payne, Alabama. This facility handles all of our warehousing and store fulfillment activities in the U.S., as well as the fulfillment of all of our e-commerce orders in the U.S. Our Canadian distribution center is located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. We also use a third-party provider, also located in Mississauga, to support our Canadian e-commerce operations. These Ontario facilities handle all of our warehousing and store fulfillment activities in Canada. Our international franchise partners receive the majority of shipments of merchandise from our third-party warehouse provider located in Greater Asia. On occasion, we may utilize additional facilities to support our seasonal warehousing needs. Damage to, or prolonged interruption of operations at, any of these facilities due to a work stoppage, weather conditions such as a tornado, hurricane or flood, other natural disaster, or other event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition in the retail industry, which could impact our ability to compete successfully against existing or future competition.\nThe children's apparel retail market is highly competitive and we face heightened price and promotional competition. We compete in substantially all of our markets with Target Corporation, GapKids, babyGap and Old Navy (each of which is a division of The Gap, Inc.), The Gymboree Corporation, Justice (a division of The Ascena Retail Group, Inc.), Carter's, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Kohl's Corporation and other department stores, as well as other discount stores such as Walmart Stores, Inc. We also compete with a wide variety of specialty stores, other national and regional retail chains, catalog companies and Internet retailers. One or more of our competitors are present in virtually all of the areas in which we have stores. We have observed that Internet retailers operate at a lower cost and do not incur the geographical limitations suffered by traditional brick and mortar stores, giving Internet retailers a competitive advantage to and imposing significant pricing pressure on brick and mortar stores. In addition, our e-commerce store may divert sales from our brick and mortar stores, cannibalizing sales results at our brick and mortar stores. Many of our competitors are larger than us and have access to significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Increased competition, declining birth rates, increased promotional activity and continuing economic pressure on value seeking consumers could also impact our ability to compete successfully. We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or future competition.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks and service marks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and service marks on a worldwide basis, including in the countries in which we have business operations or plan to have\nbusiness operations, including through foreign franchise partners. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or material challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks in the United States or Canada. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken, including to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks, may not be adequate to prevent others from imitating our products or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. Also, others may assert proprietary rights in our intellectual property and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and we may not be successful in attaining our trademarks in foreign countries where we plan to conduct business.\nBecause certain of our subsidiaries operate outside of the United States, some of our revenues, product costs and other expenses are subject to foreign economic and currency risks.\nWe have store operations in Canada and buying operations in various locations in Greater Asia, primarily Hong Kong, and we have plans to continue to expand our store operations internationally primarily through franchises.\nThe currency market has seen significant volatility in the value of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies. While our business is primarily conducted in U.S. dollars, we purchase virtually all of our products overseas, and we generate significant revenues in Canada in Canadian dollars. Cost increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could make our products less competitive or have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the third party manufacturers that produce our products, or franchisees that purchase our products, by making their purchases of raw materials or products more expensive and more difficult to finance.\nApproximately 12% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 13% of our total operating expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar value of the Canadian dollar denominated prices at which our Canadian business sells product. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of our reported sales and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we have foreign currency denominated receivables and payables that are not hedged against foreign currency fluctuations. When settled, these receivables and payables could result in significant transaction gains or losses.\nWe depend on generating sufficient cash flows, together with our existing cash balances and availability under our credit facility, to fund our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and share repurchase program or payment of dividends.\nOur ability to fund our ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, payment of dividends and debt service requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash flows. Our cash flows are dependent on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nseasonal fluctuations in our net sales and net income, which typically are lowest in the second fiscal quarter;\n\u2022\nthe timing of inventory purchases for upcoming seasons, particularly in the second fiscal quarter as our sales are lowest and we are purchasing merchandise for the back-to-school season;\n\u2022\nvendor, other supplier and agent terms and related conditions, which may be less favorable to us as a smaller company in comparison to larger companies; and\n\u2022\ngeneral business conditions, economic uncertainty or slowdown, including the continuing weakness in the overall economy.\nMost of these factors are beyond our control. It is difficult to predict the impact that general economic conditions will continue to have on consumer spending and our financial results. However, we believe that they will continue to result in reduced spending by our target customer, which would reduce our revenues and our cash flows from operating activities from those that otherwise would have been generated. In addition, steps that we may take to limit cash outlays, such as delaying the purchase of inventory, may not be successful or could delay the arrival of merchandise for future selling seasons, which could reduce our net sales or profitability. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows, we may not be able to fund our ongoing operations, planned capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, payment of dividends or potential debt service requirements and we may be required to seek additional sources of liquidity.\nIn addition, at January 31, 2015, approximately $154.7 million, or 89%, of our cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Because our investments in these foreign subsidiaries are considered permanently reinvested, any repatriation of cash from them would require the accrual and payment of U.S. federal and certain state taxes, which would negatively impact our results of operations and/or the amount of available funds. While we currently have no intention to repatriate cash from these subsidiaries, should the need arise domestically, there is no guarantee that we could do so without material adverse tax consequences. In addition, these funds are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which if these rates should move unfavorably, could cause a material decrease in available funds.\nNegative changes in the economy, such as deterioration in the U.S. and/or global economic environment, and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending, could continue to have an adverse effect on the apparel industry and on our operating results.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy. Purchases of apparel and related merchandise are generally discretionary and therefore tend to decline during recessionary and weak economic periods and also may decline at other times. This is particularly true with our target customer who is a value conscious, lower to middle income mother buying for infants and children based on need rather than based on fashion, trend or impulse. Increases in tax rates, declines in real estate values, reduced credit lending by banks, high unemployment levels, increased pressure on value seeking consumers and significant volatility in the global financial markets have negatively impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. This has and continues to adversely affect our business as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products. In North America, we have experienced a decrease in customer traffic, including at shopping malls, and a highly promotional environment. If the global macroeconomic environment continues to be weak or deteriorates further, there will likely be a negative effect on our revenues, operating margins and earnings which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition to the factors contributing to the current economic environment, there are a number of other factors that could contribute to reduced levels of consumer spending, such as increases in interest rates, fluctuating food, fuel and other energy costs, and increases in tax rates. Similarly, natural disasters, political unrest, actual or potential terrorist acts and other conflicts can also create significant instability and uncertainty in the world, causing consumers to defer purchases or preventing our suppliers and service providers from providing required services or materials to us. These or other factors could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in federal, state or local law, or our failure to comply with such laws, could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks.\nChanges in regulatory areas, such as privacy and information security, product safety, consumer credit, healthcare or environmental protection, among others, could cause our expenses to increase. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, particularly wage and hour laws, privacy laws or data collection and security laws, we could be subject to legal and reputational risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate and/or subject us to significant penalties and interest.\nOur business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Significant legislative or regulatory changes that impact our relationship with our workforce or our customers could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. None of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement. However, from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various locations. There is no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future.\nIf our landlords should suffer financial difficulty or if we are unable to successfully negotiate acceptable lease terms, it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrently, approximately 62% of our stores are located in malls, approximately 22% are located in strip centers, approximately 12% are located in outlet centers and approximately 4% are located in street stores. If any of our landlords should suffer financial difficulty, it could render them unable to fulfill their duties under our lease agreements. Such duties include providing a sufficient number of mall co-tenants, common area maintenance, utilities, and payment of real estate taxes. While we have certain remedies under our lease agreements, the loss of business that could result if a shopping center should close or if customer traffic were to significantly decline as a result of lost tenants or improper care of the facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe leases for most of our existing stores are for initial terms of 10 years. If we are unable to continue to negotiate acceptable lease and renewal terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTax matters could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including Canada and Hong Kong. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, Revenue Canada and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny disruption in, or changes to, our consumer credit arrangements, including our private label credit card agreement, may adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain consumer credit.\nCredit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing and enforcement of credit accounts and limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider. Additionally, during periods of increasing consumer credit delinquencies, financial institutions may reexamine their lending practices and procedures. There can be no assurance that the delinquencies being experienced by providers of consumer credit generally would not cause providers of third party credit offered by us to decrease the availability of, or increase the cost of such credit.\nAny of the above risks, individually or in aggregation, could have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct business and could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPending legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our business and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our business. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including treble, punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on us or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects.\nOur litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. Our reserves for litigation and regulatory matters may prove to be inadequate. Litigation and regulatory matters could materially adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows. In light of the unpredictability of our litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimately unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegislative actions and new accounting pronouncements could result in us having to increase our administrative expenses to remain compliant.\nIn order to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, future accounting guidance or disclosure requirements by the SEC, future guidance that may come from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\"PCAOB\"), or future changes in listing standards by the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we may be required to enhance our internal controls, hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all of which could cause our general and administrative expenses to increase.\nChanges to existing authoritative guidance and regulations may materially impact our financial statements. The FASB is continuing its convergence efforts with its international counterpart, the International Accounting Standards Board, to converge U.S. and International GAAP into one uniform set of accounting rules. The effect of changing accounting rules on our financial statements could be significant. Changes to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows could impact our debt covenant ratios or a lender's perception of our financial statements causing an adverse impact on our ability to obtain credit, or could impact investor analyses and perceptions of our business causing the market value of our stock to decrease. In addition, any changes in the current accounting rules, including legislative and other proposals, could increase the expenses we report under U.S. GAAP and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur share price may be volatile.\nOur common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Stock markets in general have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, price and volume fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results, our Comparable Retail Sales results, other risk factors identified here, announcements by other retailers, the overall economy and the geopolitical environment could individually or in aggregation cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nWe initiated the payment of a quarterly cash dividend in Fiscal 2014. Future declarations of quarterly cash dividends, and the establishment of future record and payment dates, are at the discretion of our Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including future financial performance, general business and market conditions, and other investment priorities. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nActs of terrorism, effects of war, natural disasters, other catastrophes or political unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe threat or actual acts of terrorism continue to be a risk to the global economy. Terrorism and potential military responses, political unrest, natural disasters, pandemics or other health issues have disrupted and could disrupt commerce, impact our ability to operate our stores in affected areas, impact our ability to import our products from foreign countries or impact our ability to provide critical functions necessary to the operation of our business. A disruption of commerce, or an inability to recover critical functions from such a disruption, could interfere with the production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise in a timely manner or increase our costs to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any of the above disruptions could undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns or customer traffic, and thus have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 85390, "SIC": 5600, "TIC": "PLCE"}
