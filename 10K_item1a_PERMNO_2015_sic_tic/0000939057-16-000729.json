Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report and our other filings with the SEC. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, capital levels, cash flows, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. The market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose some or all of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business may be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and in the economies in our market areas.\nOur primary market area is concentrated in the Puget Sound region of Washington. Our business is directly affected by market conditions, trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, and changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, also may affect our profitability adversely.\nWe are operating in an uncertain economic environment, including lackluster national and global conditions, accompanied by very low interest rates. While conditions have improved, a return to a recessionary economy could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A deterioration in economic conditions in the market area we serve could result in losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nwe may increase our allowance for loan losses;\n\u2022\ncollateral for our loans may further decline in value, in turn reducing customer's borrowing power, reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of our low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nA decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are geographically diverse. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to a large percentage of consumer loans.\nOur consumer loans accounted for $158.3 million, or 31.0% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015, of which $103.1 million (65.1% of total consumer loans) consisted of indirect home improvement loans (some of which were not secured by a lien on the real property), $29.2 million (18.5% of total consumer loans) consisted of solar loans, $23.8 million (15.1% of total consumer loans) consisted of marine loans secured by boats, $2.2 million (1.4% of total consumer loans) consisted of other consumer loans, which includes personal lines of credit, automobile, direct home improvement, loans on deposit, and recreational loans. Generally, we consider these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on owner-occupied, one-to-four-family residential properties. As a result of our large portfolio of consumer loans, it may become necessary to increase the level of provision for our loan losses, which would reduce profits. Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do one-to-four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles and boats. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance.\nMost of our consumer loans are originated indirectly by or through third parties, which presents greater risk than our direct lending products which involves direct contact between us and the borrower. Unlike a direct loan where the borrower makes an application directly to us, in these loans the dealer, who has a direct financial interest in the loan transaction, assists the borrower in preparing the loan application. Although we disburse the loan proceeds directly to the dealer upon receipt of a \u201ccompletion certificate\u201d signed by the borrower, because we do not have direct contact with the borrower, these loans may be more susceptible to a material misstatement on the loan application or having the loan proceeds being misused by the borrower or the dealer. In addition, if the work is not properly performed, the borrower may cease payment on the loan until the problem is rectified.\nIndirect home improvement and solar loans totaled $132.3 million, or 25.9% of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2015, and are originated through a network of 88 home improvement contractors and dealers located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $22.6 million in loans to borrowers that reside in California. Adverse economic conditions in California, including an increase in the level of unemployment, or a decline in real estate values could adversely affect the ability of these borrowers to make loan payments to us.\nIn addition, we rely on four dealers for a majority (53.2%) of our loan volume so the loss of one of these dealers can have a significant effect on our loan origination volume. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness of 1st Security Bank of Washington - Lending Activities - Consumer Lending\u201d and \u201c- Asset Quality.\u201d\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, continuing and growing relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers.\nOur indirect home improvement lending, which is the largest component of our loan portfolio, is reliant on our relationships with home improvement contractors and dealers. In particular, our indirect home improvement loan operations depend in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with reputable contractors and dealers who originate loans at the point of sale. Our indirect home improvement contractor/dealer network is currently comprised of 88 active contractors and dealers with businesses located throughout Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California with approximately four contractors/dealers responsible for more than half of this loan volume. Indirect home improvement and solar loans totaled $132.3 million, or 25.9% of our total gross loan portfolio, at December 31, 2015, reflecting approximately 13,000 loans with an average balance of approximately $10,000.\nWe have relationships with home improvement contractors/dealers, however, the relationships generally are not exclusive, some of them are newly established and they may be terminated at any time. If there is another economic downturn and contraction of credit to both contractors/dealers and their customers, there could be an increase in business closures and our existing contractor/dealer base could experience decreased sales and loan volume, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if a competitor were to offer better service or more attractive loan products to our contractor/dealer partners, it is possible that our partners would terminate their relationships with us or recommend customers to our competitors. If we are unable to continue to grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, we expanded consumer solar loan originations in California which enabled us to increase originations of consumer solar loans from $2.5 million at the beginning of 2013 to $27.2 million at the end of 2014. This growth continued in 2015 and resulted in $22.6 million in consumer solar loan originations during the year ended December 31, 2015. We have adopted limits on California lending to be no more than 100% of total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2015, the maximum level of California originated consumer solar loans was $82.2 million. At December 31, 2015, we held $28.9 million of these consumer solar loans to borrowers located in California.\nA significant portion of our business involves commercial business and commercial real estate lending which is subject to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2015, our loan portfolio included $152.7 million of commercial real estate, multi-family real estate loans, and commercial business loans, or 29.9% of our total gross loan portfolio, compared to $137.1 million, or 34.8%, at December 31, 2014. We have been increasing and intend to continue to increase, subject to market demand, the origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans. The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to one-to-four-family residential loans because the repayment of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans typically is dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the property securing the loan and/or the borrowers\u2019 business and the value of the real estate securing the loan as collateral, which can be significantly affected by economic conditions.\nOur renewed focus on these types of lending will increase the risk profile relative to traditional one-to-four-family lenders as we continue to implement our business strategy. Although commercial business and commercial and multi-family real estate loans are intended to enhance the average yield of the earning assets, they do involve a different, and possibly higher, level of risk of delinquency or collection than generally associated with one-to-four-family loans for a number of reasons. Among other factors, these loans involve larger balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. Since commercial business, commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans generally have large balances, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of these loans, we may need to significantly increase the provision for loan losses since any resulting charge-offs will be larger on a per loan basis. Consequently, this could materially adversely affect our future earnings. Collateral evaluation and financial statement analysis in these types of loans also requires a more detailed analysis at the time of loan underwriting and on an ongoing basis. Finally, if foreclosure occurs on a commercial real estate loan, the holding period for the collateral, if any, typically is longer\nthan for a one-to-four-family residence because the secondary market for most types of commercial real estate is not readily liquid, so we have less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these assets. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness of 1st Security Bank of Washington - Lending Activities - Commercial Real Estate Lending\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe continue to expand residential construction lending which is subject to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe make real estate construction loans to individuals and builders, primarily for the construction of residential properties. We originate these loans whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale. At December 31, 2015, construction and development loans totaled $80.8 million, or 15.8 % of our total loan portfolio, of which $58.3 million were for residential real estate projects. This compares to construction and development loans of $57.8 million, or 14.7% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2014, or an increase of 39.8% during the past year. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than longer-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate.\nConstruction and development lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property\u2019s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, during the term of most of our construction loans, an interest reserve is created at origination and is added to the principal of the loan through the construction phase. If the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted at, or prior to, the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment.\nBecause construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers' borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction. Furthermore, speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre-sold, and thus pose a greater potential risk than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences as there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. At December 31, 2015, $57.5 million of our construction portfolio was comprised of speculative one-to-four-family construction loans and $2.2 million were residential land acquisition and development loans.\nLoans on land under development or held for future construction pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand. As a result, this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor themselves to repay principal and interest. No real estate construction and development loans were non-performing at December 31, 2015. A material increase in our non-performing construction and development loans could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur mortgage warehouse lending program is subject to various risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn October 2009, we commenced a mortgage warehouse lending program. Our mortgage warehouse lending program focuses on six Pacific Northwest mortgage banking companies. Short term funding is provided to the mortgage banking companies for the purpose of originating residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. Our warehouse lending lines are secured by the underlying notes associated with mortgage loans made to borrowers by the mortgage banking company and we generally require guarantees from the principle shareholder(s) of the mortgage\nbanking company. These loans are repaid when the note is sold by the mortgage bank into the secondary market, with the proceeds from the sale used to pay down the outstanding loan before being dispersed to the mortgage bank. At December 31, 2015, we had approved warehouse lending lines in varying amounts from $3.0 million to $9.0 million with each of the six companies, for an aggregate amount of $33.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we processed approximately 1,000 loans and funded approximately $347.5 million under this program. Our mortgage warehouse related gross revenues totaled $702,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, there was $5.4 million in warehouse lines outstanding, compared to $10.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2014.\nThere are numerous risks associated with this type of lending, which include, without limitation, (i) credit risks relating to the mortgage bankers that borrow from us, (ii) the risk of intentional misrepresentation or fraud by any of these mortgage bankers, (iii) changes in the market value of mortgage loans originated by the mortgage banker, the sale of which is the expected source of repayment of the borrowings under the warehouse line of credit, due to changes in interest rates during the time in warehouse, (iv) unsalable or impaired mortgage loans so originated, which could lead to decreased collateral value and the failure of a purchaser of the mortgage loan to purchase the loan from the mortgage banker, and (v) the volatility of mortgage loan originations.\nAdditionally, the impact of interest rates on our mortgage warehouse lending business can be significant. Changes in interest rates can impact the number of residential mortgages originated and initially funded under mortgage warehouse lines of credit and thus our mortgage warehouse related revenues. A decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans. Conversely, in a constant or increasing rate environment, we would expect fewer loans to be originated.\nOur lending limit may limit growth.\nThe Board of Directors have implemented a policy lending limit that it believes matches the Washington State legal lending limit. Our policy limits loans to one borrower and the borrower\u2019s related entities to 20% of our unimpaired capital and surplus, or $17.3 million at December 31, 2015. Management has adopted an internal lending limit of a maximum of 80% of the Bank's legal lending limit for risk mitigation purposes and all loans over this limit require approval from the AQC. These amounts are significantly less than that of many of our competitors and may discourage potential commercial borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our lending limit from doing business with us. The lending limit also impacts the efficiency of our commercial lending operation because it tends to lower the average loan size, which means a higher number of transactions have to be generated to achieve the same portfolio volume. We can accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy is not efficient or always available. We may not be able to attract or maintain clients seeking larger loans or may not be able to sell participations in these loans on terms that are considered favorable.\nRevenue from mortgage banking operations are sensitive to changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market, higher interest rates or new legislation and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage banking program, which we started in the fourth quarter of 2011 in an effort to diversify our revenue streams and to generate additional income, is dependent upon our ability to originate and sell loans to investors. Mortgage revenues are primarily generated from gains on the sale of one-to-four-family residential loans underwritten to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA, USDA Rural Housing and other non-GSE investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. We sell loans on both a servicing retained and servicing released basis utilizing market execution analysis and customer relationships as the criteria. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in these programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of these entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect the success of our mortgage banking program and, consequently, our results of operations.\nMortgage loan production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and can suffer from decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market or higher interest rates. Generally, any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could adversely affect mortgage originations and, consequently, adversely affect income from mortgage lending activities.\nCurrently, as a result of government actions and other economic factors related to the economic downturn, interest rates are at historically low levels. Although recently the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System slightly increased the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points and is expected to raise the Fed Funds rate throughout 2016, based on economic conditions, interest rates are still at historically low levels. To the extent that market interest rates increase in the future, our ability to originate mortgage loans held for sale may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would adversely affect our ability to generate mortgage revenues, and consequently noninterest income. Because interest rates depend on factors outside of our control, we cannot eliminate the interest rate risk associated with our mortgage operations.\nOur results of operations will also be affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. If we cannot generate a sufficient volume of loans for sale, our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, during periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations.\nFinally, deteriorating economic conditions may also increase the potential for home buyers to default on their mortgages. In certain of these cases where we have originated loans and sold them to investors, we may be required to repurchase loans or provide a financial settlement to investors if it is proven that the borrower failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor. Such repurchases or settlements would also adversely affect our net income.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review loans and our historical loss and delinquency experience, and evaluate economic conditions. Management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses, resulting in additional provisions for loan losses to replenish the allowance for loan losses. Deterioration in economic conditions, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans or relationships, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may increase our loan charge-offs and/or may also otherwise also require an increase in our provision for loan losses.\nOur allowance for loan losses was 1.5% of total gross loans, and 765.5% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.5% of total gross loans, and 1,406.5% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2014. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize additional loan charge-offs. Any increases in the provision for loan losses may result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and capital.\nThe unseasoned nature of our commercial business, commercial construction and commercial real estate portfolios may result in difficulties in judging collectability, which may lead to additional provisions or charge-offs, which would reduce our profits.\nDuring the period from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2015, we originated $545.7 million of loans, including loans in process, with an outstanding balance of $248.7 million, at December 31, 2015. As a result, a significant portion of the portfolio is relatively unseasoned and some borrowers may not have had sufficient time to perform to properly indicate the magnitude of potential losses. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt December 31, 2015, $102.9 million, or 20.1% of our total loan portfolio, was secured by first liens on one-to-four-family residential loans and our home equity lines of credit totaled $16.5 million, or 3.2% of our total loan\nportfolio. These types of loans are generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A decline in residential real estate values resulting from a downturn in the Washington housing markets in which our loans are concentrated may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increase our risk of loss if borrowers default on their loans. A decline in economic conditions or in the volume of real estate sales and/or the sales prices coupled with elevated unemployment rates may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, and a decline in demand for our products and services. In addition, residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to the fluctuation of property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. Further, the majority of our home equity lines of credit consist of second mortgage loans. For those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses which would adversely affect our net income.\nOur non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2015, $24.9 million, or 4.9% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate properties. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant\u2019s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner\u2019s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. Furthermore, some of our non-owner occupied commercial loan borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. At December 31, 2015, we had 13 non-owner occupied commercial loan relationships, each having an outstanding balance over $500,000, with aggregate outstanding balances of $19.4 million. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one credit relationship may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to an owner occupied commercial real estate loan.\nWe occasionally purchase loans in bulk or \u201cpools.\u201d We may experience lower yields or losses on loan \u201cpools\u201d because the assumptions we use when purchasing loans in bulk may not prove correct.\nFrom time to time, we purchase real estate loans in bulk or \u201cpools.\u201d For the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased $16.3 million in adjustable rate one-to-four-family, non-owner occupied loans secured by properties located in the Puget Sound market, most of which are still in our loan portfolio. When we determine the purchase price we are willing to pay to purchase loans in bulk, management makes certain assumptions about, among other things, how fast borrowers will prepay their loans, the real estate market and our ability to collect loans successfully and, if necessary, to dispose of any real estate that may be acquired through foreclosure. When we purchase loans in bulk, we perform certain due diligence procedures and we purchase the loans subject to customary limited indemnities. To the extent that our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or the basis for those assumptions change (such as an unanticipated decline in the real estate market), the purchase price paid for \u201cpools\u201d of loans may prove to have been excessive, resulting in a lower yield or a loss of some or all of the loan principal. For example, if we purchase \u201cpools\u201d of loans at a premium and some of the loans are prepaid before we expected we will earn less interest income on the purchase than expected. Our success in growing through purchases of loan \u201cpools\u201d depends on our ability to price loan \u201cpools\u201d properly and on general economic conditions in the geographic areas where the underlying properties of our loans are located.\nAcquiring loans through bulk purchases may involve acquiring loans of a type or in geographic areas where management may not have substantial prior experience. We may be exposed to a greater risk of loss to the extent that bulk purchases contain such loans.\nOur securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Our securities portfolio is evaluated for other-\nthan-temporary impairment. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our shareholders' equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. Currently, we are expanding existing commercial real estate, commercial business and residential lending programs such as home improvement loans for consumer solar projects. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to manage our growth or deploy assets profitably could harm our business and decrease our overall profitability, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur assets and deposit base have grown substantially in recent years, and we anticipate that we will continue to grow over time, perhaps significantly. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to manage multiple aspects of the business simultaneously, including among other things: (i) improve existing and implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls; (ii) maintain effective credit scoring and underwriting guidelines; (iii) maintain sufficient levels of regulatory capital; and (iv) expand our employee base and train and manage this growing employee base. In addition, to the extent we acquire other banks and or bank branches, asset pools or deposits we may have to manage additional risks such as exposure to potential asset quality issues, disruption to our normal business activities and diversion of management's time and attention due to integration and conversion efforts. If we are unable to manage growth effectively or execute integration efforts properly, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of growth and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to sustain past levels of profitability as we grow, and our past levels of profitability should not be considered a guarantee or indicator of future success. If we are not able to maintain our levels of profitability by deploying growth in our deposits in profitable assets or investments, our net interest margin and overall level of profitability will decrease and our stock price may decline.\nHedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings.\nWe employ techniques that limit, or \u201chedge,\u201d the adverse effects of rising interest rates on our loans held for sale, and originated interest rate locks to customers. Our hedging activity varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates and other changing market conditions. These techniques may include purchasing or selling forward contracts, purchasing put and call options on securities or securities underlying futures contracts, or entering into other mortgage-backed derivatives. There are, however, no perfect hedging strategies, and interest rate hedging may fail to protect us from loss. Moreover, hedging activities could result in losses if the event against which we hedge does not materialize. Additionally, interest rate hedging could fail to protect us or adversely affect us because, among other things:\n\u2022\navailable interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability;\n\u2022\nthe party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay;\n\u2022\nthe credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction;\n\u2022\nthe value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value; and\n\u2022\ndownward adjustments, or \u201cmark-to-market losses,\u201d could reduce our stockholders' equity.\nChanges in interest rates may reduce our net interest income, and may result in higher defaults in a rising rate environment.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including domestic and international economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve, and other factors beyond our control. In an attempt to help the overall economy, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low through its targeted Fed Funds rate. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve slightly increased the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points and intends further increases of 25 basis points during 2016 subject to economic conditions. As the Federal Reserve increases the Fed Funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but could also affect: (i) our ability to originate and/or sell loans; (ii) the fair value of our interest-earning assets, which could negatively impact shareholders\u2019 equity, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; (iii) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; (iv) the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans; and (v) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and other interest-earning assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to manage this risk effectively. If we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.\nA prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates, such as we are currently experiencing limits our ability to lower our interest expense, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may decrease as our loans reprice or are originated at these low market rates. As a result of the relatively low interest rate environment, an increasing percentage of our deposits have been comprised of short-term certificates of deposit and other deposits yielding no or a relatively low rate of interest. At December 31, 2015, we had $85.1 million in certificates of deposit that mature within one year and $296.1 million in non-interest bearing, NOW checking, savings and money market accounts. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, a substantial amount of our residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit have adjustable interest rates. As a result, these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment.\nOur net income can also be reduced by the impact that changes in interest rates can have on the value of our capitalized servicing rights. At December 31, 2015, we serviced $636.1 million of loans sold to third parties, and the servicing rights associated with such loans had an amortized cost of $949,000 and an estimated fair value, at that date, of $6.8 million. Because the estimated life and estimated income to be derived from servicing the underlying loans\ngenerally increase with rising interest rates and decrease with falling interest rates, the value of servicing rights generally increases as interest rates rise and decreases as interest rates fall. If interest rates fall and the value of our capitalized servicing rights decrease, we may be required to recognize an additional impairment charge against income for the amount by which amortized cost exceeds estimated fair market value.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, debt, the sale of loans or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the Washington markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity\u201d included herein.\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nOur business is primarily relationship-driven in that some of our business development and relationship managers have extensive customer relationships. Loss of such key personnel could result in the loss of some of our customers. While we believe the relationship with key producers is good, we cannot guarantee that all of the key personnel will remain with our organization. The loss of these key persons could negatively impact the affected banking operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. These competitors primarily include national, regional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, mortgage banking finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top-quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nWe are currently subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the FDIC and the DFI. The FDIC and the DFI govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors and the DFI. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on an institution\u2019s operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Any new regulations or legislation, change in existing regulations or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a regulator's interpretation of a law or regulation, could have a material impact on our operations, increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and or otherwise adversely affect us and our profitability. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firms. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of our operations as could our interpretation of those changes.\nAs discussed under \u201cBusiness - How We Are Regulated\u201d in Item I of this Form 10-K, the Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and will affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt and implement a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting and implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the yet to be written rules and regulations for implementation will have on community banks. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our non-interest expense.\nAny other additional changes in our regulation and oversight, whether in the form of new laws, rules or regulations, could likewise make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nThe Company relies, in part, on external financing to fund its operations and the unavailability of such funds in the future could adversely impact its growth and prospects.\nThe Company relies on customer deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines and other borrowings to fund its operations. Management has historically been able to replace maturing deposits if desired; however the Company may not be able to replace such funds at any given point in time if its financial condition or market conditions change or if the cost of doing so might adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We are also required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations.\nDuring 2015, we incurred $10.0 million in subordinated debt to contribute to the Bank\u2019s capital to support its growth. At some point in the future, we may seek additional debt or may raise additional capital to support our growth and achieve our long-term business objectives. Our ability to issue additional debt or raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Such borrowings or additional capital, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected and we may have to raise additional capital on terms that may be significantly dilutive to our shareholders.\nThe Company's ability to pay dividends and make subordinated debt payments is subject to the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from its subsidiary and does not have significant operations of its own. The long-term ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders and debt payments is based primarily upon the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to the Company, and also on the availability of cash at the holding company level. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by the Bank's earnings and capital, as well as various statutes and regulations. In the event, the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock or make payments on its outstanding debt. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security could also deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our\nsystems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to our reputation and our business.\nOur security measures may not protect us from systems failures or interruptions. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services and we cannot make assurances that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur exposure to operational risks may adversely affect us.\nSimilar to other financial institutions, we are exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, the risk that sensitive customer or Company data is compromised, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur. If any of these risks occur, it could result in material adverse consequences for us.", "PERMNO": 13528, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "FSBW"}
