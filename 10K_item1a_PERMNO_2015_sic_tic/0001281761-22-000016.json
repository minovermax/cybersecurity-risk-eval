{"cik": "1281761", "company": "REGIONS FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company involves risks, some of which, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal, compliance, reputational and strategic risks, could be substantial and is inherent in our business. These risks also includes the possibility that the value of the investment could decrease considerably, and dividends or other distributions concerning the investment could be reduced or eliminated. Discussed below are risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition, as well as the value of, and return on investment in the Company.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nOur businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nWe provide traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services including asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, merger-and-acquisition advisory services and other specialty financing. All of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally or specifically in the South, Midwest and Texas, the principal markets in which we conduct business. A worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022A decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate;\n\u2022An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;\n\u2022A decrease in interest income from variable rate loans, due to declines in interest rates; and\n\u2022An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provisions for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.\nIn the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business, there can be no assurance that the federal government and the Federal Reserve would intervene. Further, the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic (including variant strains and resurgences of the COVID-19 virus) and its effects on the U.S. and global economy remains uncertain, as does the success of any measures taken or that may be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which ultimately may not be sufficient to address the specific effects of the pandemic or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. If economic conditions worsen or volatility increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nVolatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for the our products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Company\u2019s borrowers or result in lower values for the our investment securities and other interest-earning assets.\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created disruptions that have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. We cannot predict the extent to which the pandemic will cause such adverse effects in the future. The nature and extent of any ongoing or future adverse effects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and outside our control, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our employees, clients, customers, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants.\nCircumstances brought about by the pandemic persist, and likely will persist, including supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased market volatility, credit deterioration and defaults, and increased spending on business continuity efforts, which may require that we reduce costs and investments in other areas. Should the pandemic worsen, we may face additional circumstances such as significant draws on credit lines should customers seek to increase liquidity.\nWe are offering assistance to support customers based upon customer needs. If such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the pandemic on borrowers, we may experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in the future. We may also have to provide additional assistance or otherwise experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses.\nFurther, we have approximately $748 million in PPP loans as of year-end 2021. While much of the PPP forgiveness process has been completed, these efforts may continue to affect our revenue and results of operations and make our results\nmore difficult to forecast. In addition, the PPP and other government programs in which we may participate are complex and our participation may lead to governmental and regulatory scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to our reputation.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also cause some of our commercial customers to be unable to pay their loans as they come due or decrease the value of collateral, which could cause significant increases in our credit losses. The pandemic may alter consumer behavior, including short- and long-term spending patterns. Accordingly, certain of these industries may continue to be negatively impacted even after the pandemic has subsided.\nOther negative effects of the pandemic that may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations cannot be predicted at this time, but it is likely that such adverse effects will continue until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Further, a substantial majority of our assets are loans, which cannot necessarily be called or sold on timeframes short enough to meet these liquidity requirements. In addition, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated, difficult credit markets, or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, including as a result of unusual effects in the market, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have historically been able to meet the liquidity needs of customers as necessary, the ability to do so is not assured, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are concentrated primarily in the South, Midwest and Texas, and adverse changes in the economic conditions in this region can adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nOur operations are concentrated primarily in the South, Midwest and Texas. As a result, local economic conditions in these areas significantly affect the demand for the loans and other products we offer to our customers (including real estate, commercial and construction loans), the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Any declines in real estate values in these areas may adversely affect borrowers and the value of the collateral securing many of our loans, which could adversely affect our currently performing loans, leading to future delinquencies or defaults and increases in our provision for credit losses. Further or continued adverse changes in these economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWeather-related events and other natural or man-made disasters could cause a disruption in our operations or lead to other consequences that could adversely impact our financial results and condition. These impacts could be intensified by climate change. Heightening focus on climate change may also carry transition risks that could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWeather-related events, other natural or man-made disasters, climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy all pose near and long-term risks to our business and/or that of our customers and are expected to increase over time.\nA significant portion of our operations is located in the areas bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, regions that are susceptible to hurricanes, or in areas of the Southeastern U.S. that are susceptible to tornadoes and other severe weather events. In particular, in recent years, a number of severe hurricanes impacted areas in our footprint. Many areas in the Southeastern U.S. have also experienced severe droughts and floods in recent years. Any of these, or any other severe weather event, could cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. We have taken certain preemptive measures that we believe will mitigate these adverse effects, such as maintaining insurance that includes coverage for resultant losses and expenses. However, such measures cannot predict the nature, timing, or level of severe weather events or prevent the disruption that a catastrophic earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event could cause to the markets that we serve and any resulting adverse impact on our customers, such as hindering our borrowers\u2019 ability to timely repay their loans and diminishing the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters and other events connected with the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Ocean, such as oil spills, could have similar effects.\nClimate change could intensify the severity of and increase the frequency of adverse effects of weather-related events impacting us and our customers. Namely, climate change may intensify the severity of and increase the frequency of earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods and other weather-related events, which could cause even greater disruption to our business and operations. Longer-term changes, such as increasing average temperatures and rising sea levels, may damage, destroy or otherwise impact the value or productivity of our properties and other assets, reduce the availability of insurance, and/or lead to prolonged disruptions in our operations.\nResponding to concerns around climate change provides us with potential new avenues through which we can support our stakeholders but also exposes us to risks associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy. Such risks may result from changes in policies, laws and regulations, technologies, or market preferences that are intended to address climate change. These changes could materially and negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and our reputation, in addition to having a similar impact on our customers. Federal and state regulatory authorities, investors and other third parties have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in addressing risks related to climate change, which may result in financial institutions facing increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Relatedly, we may face increased scrutiny related to our ability to demonstrate resilience to potential climate-related risks, including systemic risks posed by operational disruptions and external demands. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs. In addition, the transition to a lower-carbon economy could indirectly subject Regions to specific risks through our borrowers' exposure to changes in commodity prices. For more information see \u201cWeakness in commodity businesses could adversely affect our performance\u201d below.\nWe are subject to environmental, social and governance risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks, including reputational risk, associated with environmental, social and governance, or ESG, issues. As a large financial institution with a diverse base of customers, vendors and suppliers, we may face negative publicity based on the identity of those with whom we choose to do business. The public holds diverse and conflicting views of those entities and their activities, including the perceived environmental, social or economic impacts of our business and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers. Because Regions has multiple stakeholders, among them shareholders, customers, employees, federal and state regulatory authorities, and political entities, often those stakeholders have differing priorities and expectations regarding ESG issues. Simultaneous, disparate sentiments from multiple stakeholder groups must be considered. Taking action in conflict with one or another of those stakeholder's expectations could lead to loss of business, adverse publicity, customer complaints, or public protests. Negative publicity may be driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media and may also be spread more broadly through the use of social media platforms. If Regions\u2019 relationships with its customers, vendors and suppliers were to become the subject of such negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain customers and employees, compete effectively, and grow our business may be negatively impacted. Additionally, a growing number of investors (in particular significant U.S. institutional investors who hold and manage substantial equity positions, in some cases in nearly all major U.S. listed companies) are integrating ESG factors into their analysis of the expected risk and return of potential investments. The specific ESG factors considered, as well as the approach to incorporating the factors into a broader investment process, vary by investor and can shift over time. Regions' failure to align with, or remain aligned with, investors' ESG-related priorities may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we experience greater credit losses in our loan portfolios than anticipated, our earnings may be materially adversely affected.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans and leases according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans and leases may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for credit losses based on a number of factors. Our management periodically determines the allowance for credit losses based on available information, including the quality of the loan portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accrual loans, taking into account relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions that affect the collectability of our loan portfolio. Increases in the allowance will result in an expense for the period, thereby reducing our reported net income. If, as a result of general economic conditions, there is a decrease in asset quality or growth in the loan portfolio and management determines that additional increases in the allowance for credit losses are necessary, we may incur additional expenses which will reduce our net income, and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough our management will establish an allowance for credit losses it believes is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the life of loans in our loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. For example, if a hurricane or other natural disaster were to occur in one of our principal markets or if economic conditions in those markets were to deteriorate unexpectedly, additional credit losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for credit losses may occur. Losses in excess of the existing allowance for credit losses will reduce our net income and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, perhaps materially.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for credit losses and the value attributed to non-accrual loans and to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items. These adjustments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAs discussed in greater detail below, CECL became effective January 1, 2020, and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets. The accounting standard removed the historical \u201cprobable\u201d threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead required companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets. See Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure on the impact to the allowance at adoption in 2020.\nWeakness in the residential real estate markets could adversely affect our performance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, consumer residential real estate loans represented approximately 27.1% of our total loan portfolio. Declines in home values would adversely affect the value of collateral securing the residential real estate that we hold, as well as the volume of loan originations and the amount we realize on the sale of real estate loans. These factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWeakness in the commercial real estate markets could adversely affect our performance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 8.0% of our loan portfolio consisted of investor real estate loans. The properties securing income-producing investor real estate loans are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan is instead dependent upon additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrower\u2019s successful operation of a business. Continued uncertainty in economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, may impair a borrower's business operations and slow the execution of new leases. Such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of these factors, vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space may increase, and hotel occupancy rates may decline. High vacancy and lower occupancy rates could also result in rents falling. The combination of these factors could result in deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value of some of our loans. Any such deterioration could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay the amounts due under their loans. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position could materially adversely affect our performance.\nHome equity products, particularly those in a second lien position, may carry a higher risk of of non-collection than other loans. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. Of our $6.3 billion home equity portfolio at December 31, 2021, approximately $3.7 billion were home equity lines of credit and $2.5 billion were closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). Real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $1.8 billion of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position.\nWeakness in commodity businesses could adversely affect our performance.\nMany of our borrowers operate in industries that are directly or indirectly impacted by changes in commodity prices. This includes agriculture, livestock, metals, timber, textiles and energy businesses (including oil, gas and petrochemical), as well as businesses indirectly impacted by commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in production of commodities. Changes in commodity products prices depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. These industries have been, and may in the future be, subject to significant volatility. For example, oil prices have been volatile in recent years, including in 2020 and 2021, and in 2021 commodity prices have generally increased as a result of increased demand combined with supply chain disruption driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of oil and gas price volatility, our energy-related portfolio may be subject to additional pressure on credit quality metrics including past due, criticized, and non-performing loans, as well as net charge-offs. In addition, legislative changes such as the elimination of certain tax incentives and the transition to a less carbon dependent economy in response to climate change and other factors could have significant impacts on this portfolio.\nIndustry competition may adversely affect our degree of success.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as continued industry consolidation. This consolidation may produce larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. For example, there have been a number of recently completed or announced significant mergers of financial institutions within our market areas, and there may in the future be additional consolidation. These mergers will, if completed, allow the merged financial institutions to benefit from cost savings and shared resources.\nIn our market areas, we face competition from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, internet banks, fintechs, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms,\nmortgage companies, and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business.\nIn addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services, such as loans and payment services, that traditionally were banking products, and made it possible for technology companies to compete with financial institutions in providing electronic, internet-based, and mobile phone-based financial solutions. Competition with non-banks, including technology companies, to provide financial products and services is intensifying. In particular, the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products. For example, a number of fintechs have applied for, and in some cases been granted, bank or industrial loan charters. In addition, other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. Regulatory changes, such as the December 2020 revisions to the FDIC\u2019s rules on brokered deposits intended to reflect recent technological changes and innovations, may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products. In addition to fintechs, traditional technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers and are expected to continue to explore new ways to do so. Many of these companies, including our competitors, have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures, in part due to lack of physical locations. Although providing digital products and services has been important to serving customers and competing in the financial services industry for some time, the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the move toward digital banking and financial services and we expect a bank\u2019s digital offerings to be a key competitive differentiator beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The move toward digital banking and financial services, and customer expectations regarding digital offerings, will require us to invest greater resources in technological improvements and may put us at a disadvantage to banks and non-banks with greater resources to spend on technology..\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of additional factors, including customer convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, the quality of the technology that supports the customer experience, pricing and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and to retain our current customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected, perhaps materially. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin and financial performance. In addition, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income received on interest-earning assets (primarily loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held at the FRB) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FOMC and interest rates markets.\nThe cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on market-based liquidity and short-term interest rates, the level of which is influenced heavily by the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy. However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both short-term and longer-term interest rates. Longer-term rates are affected by multiple factors including the actions of the FOMC such as quantitative easing or tightening, as well as the market\u2019s expectations for future inflation, growth and other economic considerations. The level of net interest income is, therefore, influenced by the overall level of interest rates along with the shape of the yield curve. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income may decline. Our net interest income would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest-earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe monetary response to the pandemic, including significant reductions to the federal funds rate along with the Federal Reserves's quantitative easing program, has led to a decrease in the yields on U.S. Treasury securities. The yield curve steepened throughout 2021 in anticipation of an economic recovery and removal of monetary accommodation. However, if interest rates remain near historic lows or move lower, we would expect modest declines in net interest income over the next twelve months given the protection that remains in place from the Company's interest rate hedging program.\nConversely, an increasing rate environment would have a positive impact on net interest income. However, increasing rates would also increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers and may adversely affect those borrowers\u2019 ability to pay as contractually obligated and could result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result.\nFor a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies for these risks, see the \"Executive Overview\", \u201cNet Interest Income, Margin and Interest Rate Risk,\u201d \u201cNet Interest Income and Margin,\u201d \u201cMarket Risk-Interest Rate Risk\u201d and \u201cSecurities\u201d sections of Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTransitions away from and the replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The U.K. FCA and the administrator for LIBOR have announced that the publication of one week and two-month LIBOR settings ceased to be published or to be representative as of December 31, 2021. The publication of all other LIBOR settings, which are the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, will cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. In addition, the U.S. bank regulators had also issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. As a result, financial market participants have begun to transition away from LIBOR and other similar inter-bank offering rates. This transition is further supported by the requirements of the EU Benchmarks Regulation, which no longer permits inter-bank offering rates that rely on quotes or estimates submitted by contributing banks that are not anchored in transaction-based data.\nVarious regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks. In the U.S., SOFR has been identified by the Alternate Reference Rates Committee convened by the Federal Reserve as the alternative benchmark rate to U.S. dollar LIBOR.\nHowever, there continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of LIBOR transition, including with respect to the acceptance and use of SOFR or other alternative benchmark rates. The characteristics of these new rates are not identical to the benchmarks they seek to replace, will not produce the exact economic equivalent as those benchmarks, and may perform differently in a variety of market conditions compared to those benchmarks.\nUncertainty remains as to the transition process and acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR. Derivatives markets linked to proposed alternatives, including swaps markets, have not yet developed into robust markets, which may present continuing risks as the June 30, 2023 cessation date approaches. Other benchmark administrators have also proposed potentially viable replacement rate options, including Bloomberg Index Services Limited\u2019s \u201cBSBY\u201d and the American Financial Exchange\u2019s \u201cAMERIBOR\u201d. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether any of the available rates will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. Further, it is not possible to predict the extent of additional developments in derivative markets linked to these benchmarks.\nCertain of our LIBOR-based financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, hedging products, debt obligations, preferred stock, investments, and loans, extend beyond proposed LIBOR cessation timelines. We are in the process of assessing the impact that a cessation or market replacement of LIBOR would have on these various products and contracts.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our management strategies related to the LIBOR cessation and transition, see the \u201cLIBOR Transition\u201d section of Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAny future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs and place limitations on business activities.\nThe major ratings agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings. The ratings assigned to Regions and Regions Bank remain subject to change at any time, and it is possible that any ratings agency will take action to downgrade Regions, Regions Bank or both in the future. Additionally, ratings agencies may also make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, which may affect our credit ratings. In the future, changes to existing ratings guidelines and new ratings guidelines may, among other things, adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest.\nRegions\u2019 credit ratings can have negative consequences that can impact our ability to access the debt and capital markets, as well as reduce our profitability through increased costs on future debt issuances. If Regions were to be downgraded below investment grade, we may not be able to reliably access the short-term unsecured funding markets, and certain customers could be prohibited from placing deposits with Regions Bank, which could cause us to hold more cash and liquid investments to meet our ongoing liquidity needs. Such actions could reduce our profitability as these liquid investments earn a lower return than\nother assets, such as loans. See the \"Liquidity\" section within \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for Regions' liquidity policy.\nAdditionally, if Regions were to be downgraded to below investment grade, certain counterparty contracts may be required to be renegotiated or require posting of additional collateral. Refer to Note 20 \"Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\" to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fair value of contracts subject to contingent credit features and the collateral postings associated with such contracts. Although the exact amount of additional collateral is unknown, it is reasonable to conclude that Regions may be required to post additional collateral related to existing contracts with contingent credit features.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $5.7 billion of goodwill and $305 million of other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. Although they have not to-date, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may in the future impact our assessment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions and increases in income tax rates could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIdentifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist primarily of core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationship assets, broker and contractor origination networks and agency commercial real estate licenses. Adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these intangible assets including loss of core deposits, losses of broker and contractor relationships, significant losses of credit card accounts and/or balances, increased competition and adverse changes in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Regions had approximately $306 million in net deferred tax liabilities, which included approximately $603 million of deferred tax assets (net of valuation allowance of $29 million). Our deferred tax assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes. In making this determination, we consider all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. We have determined that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized at December 31, 2021 (except for $29 million related to state deferred tax assets for which we have established a valuation allowance). If we were to conclude that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital ratios. In addition, the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities would be affected by a change in statutory tax rates. An increase in statutory rates would have an adverse effect on a net deferred tax liability position. Other tax law changes could have a detrimental impact on the value of deferred tax assets.\nChanges in the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even mere speculation about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or lease or derivative exposure due us. Any such losses may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.\nOur success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. As a large financial and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices, which may or may not affect our competitors, by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC or other regulators. These limitations could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel, in particular as we are more often competing for personnel with fintechs, technology companies and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as we do. The increase in remote work arrangements and opportunities in regional, national and global labor markets has also increased competition to attract and retain skilled personnel. Our current or future approach to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of\nour current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as the arrangements offered by other employers, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.\nWe are subject to a variety of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by employees, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including business resilience, process, third party, information technology, human resource, model, and fraud risks, each of which may be amplified by continued remote work. Regions\u2019 fraud risks include fraud committed by external parties against the Company or its customers and fraud committed internally by our associates. Certain fraud risks, including identity theft and account takeover may increase as a result of customers\u2019 account or personally identifiable information being obtained through breaches of retailers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 networks. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, report and analyze these risks; however, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, monitored or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, we may have to expend resources detecting and correcting the failure in our systems and we may be subject to potential claims from third parties and government agencies. We may also suffer severe reputational damage. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, the unauthorized disclosure, misappropriation, mishandling or misuse of personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers could result in significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss.\nDamage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and highly-skilled management and employees is impacted by our reputation. A negative public opinion of us and our business can result from any number of activities, including our lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by community organizations in response to these activities. Furthermore, negative publicity regarding Regions as an employer could have an adverse impact on our reputation, especially with respect to matters of diversity, pay equity and workplace harassment.\nSignificant harm to our reputation, or the reputation of any company, could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation and the activities of our customers, other participants in the financial services industry or our contractual counterparties, such as our service providers and vendors. The potential harm is heightened given increased attention to how corporations address environmental, social and governance issues.\nIn addition, a cybersecurity event affecting Regions or our customers\u2019 data could have a negative impact on our reputation and customer confidence in Regions and its cybersecurity practices. Damage to our reputation could also adversely affect our credit ratings and access to the capital markets.\nAdditionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the widespread use of social media platforms by virtually every segment of society facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to our reputation.\nWe are subject to a variety of systems failure and cybersecurity risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nFailure in or breach of our systems, or those of our third-party service providers (or providers to such third-party service providers), including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our businesses or the businesses of our customers. This could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage to our reputation, increases to our costs and cause financial losses. As a large financial institution, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As public and regulatory expectations, as well as our customers\u2019 expectations, have increased regarding operational performance and information security, our systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting and data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts and civil unrest; and, as described below, cyber-attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see the \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity\u201d section of Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInformation security risks for large financial institutions, such as Regions, have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of technology-based products and services and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. This increase is expected to continue and further intensify. Third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us, including security breaches or failures of their own systems. In recent years, attacks in which hackers inserted\nmalware into software updates, have highlighted the growing risk from the infection of software while it is under assembly, known as a supply chain attack. While Regions has not experienced similar attacks, we could become the subject of a similar style attack through a supply chain compromise. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. Although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls designed to prevent or limit the effects of a cyber-attack or information security breach, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers\u2019 devices may be the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Regions\u2019 or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information. We also have insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain losses associated with cyber-attacks or information security breaches, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses from any such attack or breach, including any related damage to our reputation. In addition, given the proliferation of cyber-events in our industry, the cost of cyber insurance is expected to continue to increase and may not be available at all or on acceptable terms. Additionally, cyber-attacks (such as denial of service, ransomware, or malware attacks), hacking or terrorist activities, could disrupt Regions\u2019 or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. For example, denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, including Regions. Although these past events have not resulted in a breach of Regions\u2019 client data or account information, such attacks have adversely affected the performance of Regions Bank\u2019s website, www.regions.com, and, in some instances, prevented customers from accessing Regions Bank\u2019s secure websites for consumer and commercial applications. In all cases, the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience; however, future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging, and Regions may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. Work-from-home arrangements such as those implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may also present additional cybersecurity, information security and operational risks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a modest increase in cybersecurity events, such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic. Our layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events to date.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. We may also be required to incur significant costs in connection with any regulatory investigation or civil litigation resulting from a cyber-attack or information security breach that impacts us. In addition, our third-party service providers may be unable to identify vulnerabilities in their systems or, once identified, be unable to promptly provide required patches or other remedial measures. Further, even if provided, such patches or remedial measures may not fully address any vulnerability or may be difficult for Regions to implement. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These criminals may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, civil litigation, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, remediation costs, additional cybersecurity protection costs, increased insurance premiums and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We could also be adversely affected if we lost access to information or services from a third-party service provider as a result of a security breach, system or operational failure or disruption affecting the third-party service provider. For a more detailed discussion of these risks and specific occurrences, see the \u201cInformation Security Risk\u201d section of Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy and security-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. In addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, performing upfront due diligence and ongoing monitoring activities, we do not control their actions. Any issues that arise with respect to these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided\nby a vendor (including as a result of a cyber-attack, other information security event or a natural disaster), financial or operational difficulties for the vendor, issues at third-party vendors to the vendors, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, poor performance of services, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of our vendors, could trigger regulatory notification obligations on us, adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, our reputation and our ability to conduct our business. In certain situations, replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable, inherent risk to our business operations. Such risk was also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as many of our vendors have also been, and may continue to be, affected by increased remote work, market volatility and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors if made available. If this information is inaccurate, we may be subject to regulatory action, reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to property.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on the mortgage secondary market for some of our liquidity.\nIn 2021, we sold 45.1% of the mortgage loans we originated to the Agencies. We rely on the Agencies to purchase loans that meet their conforming loan requirements in order to reduce our credit risk and provide funding for additional loans we desire to originate. We cannot provide assurance that the Agencies will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other factors. Additionally, various proposals have been made to reform the U.S. residential mortgage finance market, including the role of the Agencies. The exact effects of any such reforms, if implemented, are not yet known, but they may limit our ability to sell conforming loans to the Agencies. If we are unable to continue to sell conforming loans to the Agencies, our ability to fund, and thus originate, additional mortgage loans may be adversely affected, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we may conduct.\nIn connection with our sale of one or more loan portfolios, we may make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are incorrect, we may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or we may be required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans. We may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold. If we are required to make any indemnity payments or repurchases and do not have a remedy available to us against a solvent counterparty, we may not be able to recover our losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases. Consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we must report as held for sale any loans that we have undertaken to sell, whether or not a purchase agreement for the loans has been executed. We may, therefore, be unable to ultimately complete a sale for part or all of the loans we classify as held for sale. Management must exercise its judgment in determining when loans must be reclassified from held for investment status to held for sale status under applicable accounting guidelines. Any failure to accurately report loans as held for sale could result in regulatory investigations and monetary penalties. Any of these actions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Reclassifying loans from held for investment to held for sale also requires that the affected loans be marked to the lower of cost or fair value. As a result, any loans classified as held for sale may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and by changes in the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. We may be required to reduce the value of any loans we mark held for sale, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur reported financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our reported financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. The Company\u2019s critical accounting estimates include: the allowance for credit losses; fair value measurements; intangible assets; residential MSRs; and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the allowance provided; recognize significant losses on assets carried at fair value; recognize significant impairment on our goodwill, other intangible assets or deferred tax asset balances; significantly increase our accrued income taxes; or significantly decrease the value of our residential MSRs. Any of these actions could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the models that we use in our business perform poorly or provide inadequate information, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe utilize quantitative models, machine learning models, and artificial intelligence models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values. Models may be used in processes such as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, forecasting financial performance, predicting losses, improving customer services, maintaining adherence to laws and regulations, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels, preventing fraud, strengthening customer authentication processes, generating marketing analytics, prospecting leads, and estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models present the risk that our business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy or inaccuracy of that information, which may lead to losses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, FASB\u2019s CECL accounting standard became effective on January 1, 2020 and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The standard had a material impact to our allowance and capital at adoption. See Regions' impact at adoption in Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn March 2020, the federal banking agencies released an interim final rule, subsequently adopted as a final rule in August 2020, which allows an addback to regulatory capital for the impacts of CECL for a two-year period and at the end of the two years the impact is then phased in over the following three years. See Note 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure on the impact of the addback.\nRisks Arising From the Legal and Regulatory Framework in which Our Business Operates\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to litigation, investigations and governmental proceedings that may result in liabilities adversely affecting our financial condition, business or results of operations or in reputational harm.\nWe and our subsidiaries are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in various class actions and other litigation, and may be the subject of subpoenas, reviews, requests for information, investigations, and formal and informal proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies regarding our and their businesses and activities (including subpoenas, requests for information and investigations related to the activities of our customers). Any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations, financial condition or ability to conduct our business, including adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties (including civil money penalties under applicable banking laws), injunctions, restitution, orders,\nrestrictions on our business activities or other relief. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or self-regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or self-regulatory agencies (including the inquiries mentioned above) begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations, including those relating to anti-money laundering matters or sales practices, have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. Regulators and other governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue enforcement actions, or seek admissions of wrongdoing, in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a firm has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit our activities.\nAdditional information relating to our litigation, investigations and other proceedings is discussed in Note 23 \"Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\" to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and examination governing almost all aspects of our operations, which limits the businesses in which we may permissibly engage. The laws and regulations governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our depositors, our customers, the financial system and the FDIC insurance fund, not our shareholders or other creditors. These laws and regulations govern a variety of matters, including certain debt obligations, changes in control, maintenance of adequate capital, and general business operations and financial condition (including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on dividends and repurchases of our capital securities, establishment of branch offices, and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law). Further, we must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in many activities, and our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely. There can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require or otherwise seek will be obtained.\nRegulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified or repealed at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us, Regions Bank and our subsidiaries, including any changes resulting from the recent change in U.S. presidential administration and change in control of the U.S. Senate.\nAny changes in any federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our regulatory capital position is discussed in greater detail in Note 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.\nRegions and Regions Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nRegions and Regions Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the Basel III framework. The Basel Committee has published standards that it describes as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. These standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2028. Among other things, these standards revise the standardized approach for credit risk and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the current capital rules, these standards only apply to advanced approached institutions and not to Regions or Regions Bank, however the impact of these standards on us will depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as Regions and Regions Bank.\nFor more information concerning our compliance with capital and liquidity requirements, see Note 12 \"Regulatory Capital Requirements and Restrictions\" to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K..\nRulemaking changes and regulatory initiatives implemented by the CFPB may result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nSince its formation, the CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules and introduced new regulatory initiatives that could have a significant impact on our business and the financial services industry more generally. We may also be required to add additional compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. Our business, results of operations or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result.\nWe may not be able to complete future acquisitions, may not be successful in realizing the benefits of any future acquisitions that are completed, or may choose not to pursue acquisition opportunities we might find beneficial.\nWe may, from time to time, evaluate and engage in the acquisition or divestiture of businesses (including their assets or liabilities, such as loans or deposits). We must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including in certain cases, federal and state bank regulatory approvals.\nThe process for obtaining required regulatory approvals, particularly for large financial institutions, like Regions, can be difficult, time-consuming and unpredictable. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability, or our perceived inability, to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all.\nAssuming we are able to successfully complete one or more transactions, we may not be able to successfully integrate and realize the expected synergies from any completed transaction in a timely manner or at all. In particular, we may be held responsible by federal and state regulators for regulatory and compliance failures at an acquired business prior to the date of the acquisition, and these failures by the acquired company may have negative consequences for us, including the imposition of formal or informal enforcement actions. Completion and integration of any transaction may also divert management attention from other matters, result in additional costs and expenses, or adversely affect our relationships with our customers and employees, any of which may adversely affect our business or results of operations. Future acquisitions may also result in dilution of our current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests or may require we incur additional indebtedness or use a substantial amount of our available cash and other liquid assets. As a result, our financial condition may be affected, and we may become more susceptible to economic conditions and competitive pressures.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance assessments may adversely affect our earnings.\nOur deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, we are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally cannot control the amount of assessments we will be required to pay for FDIC insurance. The FDIC may require us to pay higher FDIC assessments than we currently do or may charge additional special assessments or future prepayments if, for example, there are financial institution failures in the future. Any increase in deposit assessments or special assessments may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Deposit Insurance\u201d discussion within Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d and the \u201cNon-Interest Expense\u201d discussion within Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance assessments applicable to Regions Bank.\nUnfavorable results from ongoing stress analyses may adversely affect our ability to retain customers or compete for new business opportunities.\nThe Federal Reserve conducts supervisory stress testing of Regions to evaluate our ability to absorb losses in baseline and severely adverse economic and stressed financial scenarios generated by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has implemented the SCB framework which created a firm-specific risk sensitive buffer that is informed by the results of supervisory stress testing, and is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help determine effective minimum ratio requirements. Firm specific SCB requirements, as well as a summary of the results of certain aspects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress testing and firm specific results are released publicly.\nAlthough the theoretical stress tests are not meant to assess our current condition or outlook, our customers may misinterpret and negatively react to the results of these stress tests despite the strength of our financial condition. Any potential misinterpretations and adverse reactions could limit our ability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers or effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur regulators may also require us to raise additional capital or take other actions, or may impose restrictions on capital distributions, based on the results of the supervisory stress tests, such as requiring revisions or resubmission of our annual capital plan, which could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital securities. In addition, we may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on terms that we believe are advantageous to Regions or its current shareholders. Any such capital raises, if required, may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders. As discussed in the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the second quarter of 2021, we received the results of our voluntary participation in the 2021 CCAR process. The Federal Reserve communicated that the Company exceeded all minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test and the\nCompany's SCB for the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022 is floored at 2.5 percent. Despite exceeding these minimum capital levels, we may experience unfavorable results from stress test analyses in the future.\nIf an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, we could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new mechanism, the OLA, for liquidation of systemically important BHCs and non-bank financial companies. The OLA is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC\u2019s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the Orderly Liquidation Fund, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as Regions. Any such assessments may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by Regions Bank to us, as well as by us to our shareholders. Regulations of both the Federal Reserve and the State of Alabama affect the ability of Regions Bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to the holding company. If Regions Bank is unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common and preferred shareholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. See the \u201cShareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d section of Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. As a result, shares of our capital stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, our subsidiaries\u2019 total deposits and borrowings were approximately $139.6 billion.\nWe may not pay dividends on shares of our capital stock.\nHolders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of our capital stock, including our common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such junior stock, unless we have declared and paid full dividends on our outstanding preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period.\nWe are also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock. For example, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that BHCs should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition. Additionally, Regions is subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s SCB requirement whereby supervisory stress testing informs a buffer above regulatory minimum capital levels that must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions. Lastly, if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason, we may be limited in our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock.\nAnti-takeover and banking laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value.\nCertain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us without our Board\u2019s approval. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring control of a BHC. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a BHC or state member bank, including shares of our common stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer \u201ccontrols\u201d the BHC or state member bank. Also, as noted under the \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d section of Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a BHC must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any bank, including Regions Bank. One factor the federal banking agencies must consider in certain acquisitions is the systemic impact of the transaction. This may make it more difficult for large institutions to acquire other large institutions and may otherwise delay the regulatory approval process, possibly by requiring public hearings. Similarly, under Alabama state law, a person or group of persons must receive approval from the Superintendent of Banks before acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of an Alabama bank or any entity having control of an Alabama bank. For the purposes of determining whether approval is required, \u201ccontrol\u201d is defined as the power, directly or indirectly, to vote the lesser of (i) 25% or more of any class of voting securities of an Alabama bank (or any entity having\ncontrol of an Alabama bank) or (ii) 10% or more of any class of voting securities of an Alabama bank (or any entity having control of an Alabama bank) if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a majority of that class of voting securities following the acquisition of such voting securities. Furthermore, there also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. For example, holders of our preferred stock have certain voting rights that could adversely affect share value. If and when dividends on the preferred stock have not been declared and paid for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting our Board will automatically be increased by two, and the preferred shareholders will be entitled to elect the two additional directors. Also, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the then-outstanding shares of the preferred stock is required to consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification involving the preferred stock, or a merger or consolidation of Regions with or into another entity, unless certain requirements are met. These statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, including the rights of the holders of our preferred stock, could result in Regions being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus adversely affect our share value.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and (ii) the federal district courts of the United States as the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company or our company\u2019s directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws (our \u201cbylaws\u201d) contain two forum selection provisions. First, our bylaws provide that, except for claims made under the Securities Act of 1933 (which are the subject of the forum selection provision described in the following sentence), unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) derivative actions brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) certain actions asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty, (iii) actions asserting a claim against the Company or a director, officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws or (iv) any actions asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be a state court located within the State of Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction. In addition, our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, shall be the federal district courts of the United States; provided, however, that if this particular exclusive forum provision or its application is deemed illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Our bylaws further provide that our shareholders are deemed to have received notice of and consented to both of these forum selection provisions.\nThe forum selection provisions of our bylaws may discourage claims or limit shareholders\u2019 ability to submit claims in a judicial forum that they find favorable, and may result in additional costs for a stockholder seeking to bring a claim. Additionally, with respect to our forum selection provision relating to claims made under the Securities Act, we note that, while Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act. As noted above, our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, U.S. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act except where the provision or its application is deemed illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in which case the exclusive forum for the action will be the Delaware Court of Chancery. While we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce our forum selection provisions is low, if a court were to determine either forum selection provision to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in a particular action, we may incur additional costs in conjunction with our efforts to resolve the dispute in an alternative jurisdiction or multiple jurisdictions, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nRisks Related to Our Capital or Debt\nThe market price of shares of our capital stock will fluctuate.\nThe market price of our capital stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects. The market price of our capital stock, including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock, may be subject to fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nOur capital stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nOur capital stock, including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock, ranks junior to all of Regions\u2019 existing and future indebtedness and Regions\u2019 other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation. As of December 31, 2021,\nRegions\u2019 total liabilities were approximately $144.6 billion, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to increase our capital resources. Additionally, if our total capital ratio or the total capital ratio of Regions Bank falls below the required minimums, we or Regions Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by through additional offerings of debt securities, including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes or other applicable securities to which our capital stock would rank junior with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation.\nWe may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future, but may be unable to do so.\nWe may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and for other business purposes. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, prevailing conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. An economic slowdown or loss of confidence in financial institutions could increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. We cannot be assured that capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of Regions Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt ratings, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of existing shareholders\u2019 equity ownership.\nWe may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital, support growth, or to make acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our employees. These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of our existing shareholders.", "PERMNO": 35044, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RF"}
