Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Bankruptcy\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nOn March 18, 2016, the Company filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court.\nOur operations and ability to develop and execute our business plan, our financial condition, our liquidity and our continuation as a going concern, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our bankruptcy. These risks include the following:\n\u00b7\nour ability to prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 proceedings\u037e\n\u00b7\nthe high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties\u037e\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations\u037e\n\u00b7\nour ability to execute our business plan in the current depressed commodity price environment\u037e\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us\u037e\n\u00b7\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to convert the Chapter 11 proceedings to Chapter 7 proceedings\u037e and\n\u00b7\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nDelays in our Chapter 11 proceedings increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees, and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. We also need Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events that occur during our Chapter 11 proceedings will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nTo emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements related to the adequacy of disclosure with respect to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a reorganization plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan. The Bankruptcy Court approved the disclosure statement with respect to the Plan on May 16, 2016. While a confirmation hearing on the Plan has been scheduled on July 13, 2016, it is possible that hearing could be delayed. It is also possible that the Bankruptcy Court will not confirm the Plan.\nCreditors may not vote in favor of our Plan, and certain parties in interest may file objections to the Plan in an effort to persuade the Bankruptcy Court that we have not satisfied the confirmation requirements under Section 1129 of\nthe Bankruptcy Code. Even if no objections are filed and the requisite acceptances of our Plan are received from creditors entitled to vote on the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court, which can exercise substantial discretion, may not confirm the Plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, or equity interests).\nIf the Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims.\nEven if a Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Plan or another Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including further deterioration in commodity prices or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in demand for our oil and gas and increasing expenses. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the Plan or any other Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced or discharged through the Plan, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of our Chapter 11 proceedings. Our access to additional financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, extremely limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, if they are available at all.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital. As a result, we cannot give any assurance of our ability to continue as a going concern, even if the Plan is confirmed.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and may not be able to obtain sufficient liquidity to confirm a plan of reorganization and exit bankruptcy.\nAlthough we have lowered our capital budget and reduced the scale of our operations significantly, our business remains capital intensive. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 proceedings. While we entered into a Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) Credit Agreement in connection with the Chapter 11 filings, which provides for a multi-draw term loan in an aggregate amount of up to $35.0 million, as of the date hereof, we have not received a commitment for any additional interim financing or exit financing to repay the DIP financing if drawn.\nThere are no assurances that our current liquidity is sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 proceedings, allow us to proceed with the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and allow us to emerge from bankruptcy. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure additional interim financing or exit financing sufficient to meet our liquidity needs on acceptable terms.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 case to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in our Plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in our Chapter 11 proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the Chapter 11 proceedings, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing.\nIn addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may change materially relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.\nThe implementation of our Chapter 11 Plan may limit or reduce, and transfers and issuances of our equity otherwise may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and depreciation, depletion and amortization deductions in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $558 million as of December 31, 2015. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. Under our Chapter 11 plan, as a result of excluding cancellation of debt income and being required to reduce certain tax attributes, including our net operating losses and our tax basis in our assets, we anticipate that our ability to carry forward our existing net operating losses will be significantly reduced or eliminated, regardless of whether Section 382 applies. In addition if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382, then our ability to otherwise use our current or future net operating loss carryforwards and amortizable tax basis in our properties, in each case prior to such ownership change, may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 if one or more stockholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Absent an applicable exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation. Further, future deductions for depreciation, depletion and amortization could be limited if the fair value of our assets is determined to be less than the tax basis.\nRisks Related to our Business:\nCommodity prices are volatile and change for reasons that are beyond our control. Decreases in the price we receive for our production adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nDeclines in the prices we receive for our production adversely affect many aspects of our business, including our financial condition, revenues, profitability, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity, rate of growth, quantity and\npresent value of our reserves, and the carrying value of our properties, all of which depend primarily or in part upon those prices. For example, due in significant part to lower commodities prices, our revenues from oil and natural gas sales declined 74% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Declines in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas also adversely affect our ability to finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, raise capital and satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, declines in prices reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and the estimated value of that production and, as a result, adversely affect our estimated proved reserves. For example, lower commodity prices contributed to a dramatic decline in our proved reserves from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Among other things, a reduction in our reserves can limit the capital available to us, as the availability of many sources of capital likely will be based to a significant degree on the estimated quantities and value of those reserves.\nCommodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand. Prices have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. During 2015, the daily Brent oil spot price ranged from a high of $66.77 per Bbl to a low of $36.11 per Bbl and the NYMEX natural gas Henry Hub spot price ranged from a high of $3.23 per MMBtu to a low of $1.76 per MMBtu. The prices of oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, geopolitical factors affecting other oil producing countries, the actions of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, the level of global oil and natural gas exploration activity and inventories, the price, availability and consumer acceptance of alternative fuel sources, the availability of refining capacity, technological advances affecting energy consumption, weather conditions, speculative activity, financial and commercial market uncertainty and worldwide economic conditions.\nIn addition to factors affecting the price of oil and natural gas generally, the prices we receive for our production is affected by factors specific to us and to the local markets where the production occurs. Pricing can be influenced by, among other things, local or regional supply and demand factors (such as refinery or pipeline capacity issues, trade restrictions and governmental regulations) and the terms of our sales contracts.\nThe prices we receive for our production are also affected by the specific characteristics of the production relative to production sold at benchmark prices. For example, our California oil typically has a lower gravity, and a portion has higher sulfur content, than oil sold at certain benchmark prices. Therefore, because our oil requires more complex refining equipment to convert it into high value products, it may sell at a discount to those prices. This discount, or differential, varies over time and can be affected by factors that do not have the same impact on the price of premium grade light oil. We cannot predict how the differential applicable to our production will change in the future, and it is possible that it will increase. The difficulty involved in predicting the differential also makes it more difficult for us to effectively hedge our production. Many of our hedging arrangements are based on benchmark prices and therefore do not protect us from adverse changes in the differential applicable to our production.\nOur planned operations will require additional capital that may not be available.\nOur business is capital intensive, and requires substantial expenditures to maintain currently producing wells, to make the acquisitions and/or conduct the exploration, exploitation and development activities necessary to replace our reserves, to pay expenses and to satisfy our other obligations. In recent years, we have chosen to pursue projects that required capital expenditures in excess of cash flow from operations. That fact has made us dependent on external financing to a greater degree than many of our competitors. If we reduce our capital spending in an effort to conserve cash this would likely result in production being lower than anticipated, and could result in reduced revenues, cash flow from operations and income. We have reduced our planned capital expenditures for 2016 relative to 2015, and expect this to result in a decline in production for the year.\nDPC is a holding company and is dependent on distributions from Venoco to pay its obligations on its senior notes.\nDPC is a holding company with no business operations and no material assets other than the capital stock of Venoco. All of our operations are conducted through Venoco and its subsidiaries. Consequently, DPC is dependent on dividends, distributions, loans or other payments from Venoco to satisfy its obligations.\nThe ability of Venoco to pay dividends and make other payments to DPC will depend on the cash flows and earnings of Venoco and its subsidiaries, which, in turn, are subject to all of the risks associated with operating in the oil and natural gas industry and as discussed in this section. The ability of DPC\u2019s direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws and regulations and by the terms of the agreements into which they enter.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the relevant underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantity and present value of our reserves.\nThe reserve data included in this report represent estimates only. Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various estimates, including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors, such as future commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes and availability of capital, estimates of required capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. The assumptions underlying our estimates of our proved reserves could prove to be inaccurate, and any significant inaccuracy could materially affect, among other things, future estimates of our reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to our properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of our future net cash flows.\nAdditionally, SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be recorded if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This rule has limited and may in the future limit our ability to record additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program although we had no proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nEstimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves is almost always based on analogy to existing wells as contrasted with the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Revenues from estimated proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves will not be realized until sometime in the future, if at all.\nYou should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The actual prices we receive for our production, the timing and success of the production and the expenses related to the development of oil and natural gas properties, each of which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, will affect the timing and amount of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In addition, our PV-10 estimates are based on assumed future prices and costs. Because market prices for oil at the end of 2015 were significantly lower than the assumed future prices for the year determined under SEC rules, the estimated quantity and present values of our reserves presented in this report are higher than they would be if we had used year-end oil prices instead. Moreover, the lower year-end prices may be more reflective of future economic conditions. Further, the effect of derivative instruments is not reflected in these assumed prices. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor to calculate PV-10 may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.\nOil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities may not be successful and could result in a complete loss of a significant investment.\nExploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to many risks. For example, new wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. Similarly, previously producing wells that are returned to production after a period of being shut in may not produce at levels that justify the expenditures made to bring the wells back on line. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry holes but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. Moreover, even commercial wells may be less productive or more expensive than we expect and production from those wells may decline faster than we project. Even when properly used, the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to\ndrilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. In addition, the cost of exploration, exploitation and development activities is subject to numerous uncertainties, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our exploration, exploitation and development activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\nproblems in delivery of our oil and natural gas to market;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u00b7\nequipment or wellbore failures or accidents;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\nreductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, including with respect to permitting issues; and\n\u00b7\ncosts of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, qualified personnel and services.\nDry holes and other unsuccessful or uneconomic exploration, exploitation and development activities adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition, and can adversely affect our reserves.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon gathering systems, transportation facilities and processing facilities that we do not control. When these facilities or systems are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, processing facilities and related infrastructure and services owned by third parties. In general, we do not control these assets or services and our access to them may be limited or denied due to circumstances beyond our control. A significant disruption in the availability of these assets or services could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market the oil and natural gas we produce and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. For example, we have been significantly adversely affected by the rupture and shutdown of the Plains pipeline. In some cases, our ability to deliver to market our oil and natural gas is dependent upon coordination among third parties who own or provide facilities or services we use, and any inability or unwillingness of those parties to coordinate efficiently could also interrupt our operations. These are risks for which we generally do not maintain insurance.\nOur hedging arrangements involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases, result in financial losses or reduce our income.\nTo reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our production. See \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for a summary of our hedging activity. Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u00b7\nproduction is less than expected;\n\u00b7\na counterparty to a hedging contract fails to perform under the contract; or\n\u00b7\nthere is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging contract and the actual prices received.\nA significant percentage of our cash flow in some prior periods resulted from payments made to us by our hedge counterparties. If hedge counterparties are unable to make payments to us under our hedging arrangements, our results of operation, financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected. In addition, the uncertainties associated with our hedging programs are greater than those of many of our competitors because the price of the heavy oil that we produce in California is subject to risks that are in addition to the price risk associated with premium grade light oil produced by many of our competitors. Also, our working capital could be impacted if we enter into derivative arrangements that require cash collateral and commodity prices subsequently change in a manner adverse to us. The obligation to post cash or other collateral could, if imposed, adversely affect our liquidity.\nMoreover, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial realized and unrealized losses relating to our hedging arrangements. Realized commodity derivative gains or losses represent the difference between the strike prices set forth in hedging contracts settled during the relevant period and the ultimate settlement prices. We incur a realized commodity derivative loss when a contract is settled at a price above the strike price. Losses of this type reflect the limit our hedging arrangements impose on the benefits we would otherwise have received from an increase in the price of oil or natural gas during the period. Unrealized commodity derivative gains and losses represent the change in the fair value of our open derivative contracts from period to period. We incur an unrealized commodity derivative loss when the futures price used to estimate the fair value of a contract at the end of the period rises. We may experience more volatility in our commodity derivative gains and losses than many of our competitors because we do not designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and because we hedge a larger percentage of our production than some of our competitors.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of doing business and limit our growth.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to exploration for, and the exploitation, development, production and transportation of, oil and natural gas, as well as environmental, safety and other matters. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations applicable to us include those relating to:\n\u00b7\nland use restrictions, which are particularly strict along the coast of southern California where many of our operations are located;\n\u00b7\ndrilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements;\n\u00b7\nspacing of wells;\n\u00b7\nemissions into the air;\n\u00b7\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u00b7\nhabitat and endangered species protection;\n\u00b7\nthe management and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials;\n\u00b7\nthe use of underground storage tanks;\n\u00b7\ntransportation and drilling permits;\n\u00b7\nthe use of underground injection wells, which affects the disposal of water from our wells;\n\u00b7\nsafety precautions and compliance requirements;\n\u00b7\nhydraulic fracturing (including limitations on the use of this technology);\n\u00b7\nthe prevention of oil spills;\n\u00b7\nthe closure of production facilities;\n\u00b7\noperational reporting; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation and royalties.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries;\n\u00b7\nproperty and natural resource damages;\n\u00b7\nreleases or discharges of hazardous materials;\n\u00b7\nwell reclamation costs;\n\u00b7\noil spill clean-up costs;\n\u00b7\nother remediation and clean-up costs;\n\u00b7\nplugging and abandonment costs, which may be particularly high in the case of offshore facilities;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties; and\n\u00b7\nother environmental damages.\nAny noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative, civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities, including suspension or termination of operations. We were, previously, a defendant in a series of lawsuits alleging, among other things, that air, soil and water contamination from the oil and natural gas facility at our Beverly Hills field caused the plaintiffs to develop cancer or other diseases or to sustain related injuries. Similar suits and/or related indemnity claims in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Moreover, compliance with applicable laws and regulations could require us to delay, curtail or terminate existing or planned operations.\nSome environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred and without negligence on our part or for the conduct of prior operators of properties we have acquired or other third parties, including, in some circumstances, operators of properties in which we have an interest and parties that provide transportation services for us. Similarly, some environmental laws and regulations impose joint and several liability, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of a particular reclamation or other obligation, and potentially the entire obligation, where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example by installing and maintaining pollution control devices. Similarly, our plugging and abandonment obligations will be substantial and may be more than our estimates. Compliance costs are relatively high for us because many of our properties are located offshore California and in other environmentally sensitive areas and because California environmental laws and regulations generally are very strict. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters, but they will be material. Environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.\nChanges in applicable laws and regulations could increase our costs, reduce demand for our production, impede our ability to conduct operations or have other adverse effects on our business. In particular, zoning changes related to the processing facility for the South Ellwood field could prohibit continued use of the facility.\nFuture changes in the laws and regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult or expensive to conduct our operations and may have other adverse effects on us. Examples of changes in laws and regulations that may affect us adversely include the following:\nZoning. Venoco\u2019s Ellwood Onshore Facility (\u201cEOF\u201d) is located in the City of Goleta, Santa Barbara County, California. The EOF removes water and gas from crude oil produced from Venoco\u2019s platform Holly before it is transported by pipeline to market. The EOF is a legal non-conforming use because, in 1991, after the EOF was constructed, the County of Santa Barbara rezoned the property for recreational uses. In January 2015, the Goleta City Council passed an ordinance establishing procedures and guidelines for the termination of nonconforming uses. Under the ordinance, the Goleta City Council could hold a hearing and, after considering certain factors specified in the ordinance, order the termination of the nonconforming use within five years. If so, and if a termination order were entered, Venoco could then apply for a modification of the order to extend the date by which the nonconforming use for the EOF must cease up to an additional 15 years. However, there can be no assurance that such a modification would be granted, or that any legal challenge Venoco might bring regarding the ordinance or its implementation would be successful. If the EOF is terminated, Venoco would have to find an economical alternative to processing crude oil at the EOF or stop producing crude oil from platform Holly. Any alternative processing arrangement would likely entail increased costs, and these costs could be material. Venoco and the City of Goleta have entered into a tolling agreement to give the parties time to gather information and determine whether a negotiated settlement of the dispute is feasible. If Venoco is prevented from using the EOF, this could have a material adverse effect on our production, reserves, cash flows and liquidity.\nGreenhouse Gases. The EPA has issued a notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) present an endangerment to human health and the environment, which allows EPA to begin regulating GHG emissions under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. EPA is implementing GHG-related reporting and permitting rules, with which we are complying. Similarly, the U.S. Congress has considered and may in the future consider \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on emissions of GHGs in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission \u201callowances\u201d corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. On September 27, 2006, California\u2019s governor signed into law Assembly Bill (AB) 32, known as the \u201cCalifornia Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006,\u201d which established a statewide cap on GHGs designed to reduce the state\u2019s GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and establishes a cap and trade program. The California Air Resources Board adopted cap and trade regulations that went into effect on January 1, 2012. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs would likely require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our production.\nOn May 12, 2016, the EPA announced its final regulations that set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of an effort to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. Under the rule, oil and gas companies will have to find and repair leaks, capture gas from the completion of fracked wells, limit emissions from new and modified pneumatic pumps, and limit emissions from several types of equipment used at gas transmission compressor stations, including compressors and pneumatic controllers. The California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) also is working on a rulemaking to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas production, processing, storage, and well stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing). CARB has held a series of workshops concerning the draft regulations, which include additional control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements focused on fugitive methane emissions for much of the oil and natural gas industry. In addition, on March 10, 2016, EPA announced that it will begin a formal process under CAA \u00a7 111(d) to require companies operating existing oil and gas sources to provide information to assist EPA in developing comprehensive regulations to reduce methane emissions. EPA will send Information Collection Requests (ICRs) to operators to gather information on existing sources of methane emissions, technologies to reduce those emissions, and the costs of those technologies in the production, gathering, processing, and transmission and storage segments of the oil and gas sector.\nHydraulic Fracturing. We have on occasion in the past engaged in activities involving the use of hydraulic fracturing, and could use hydraulic fracturing in the future. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that creates a fracture extending from the well bore in a rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily through the rock to a production well. Fractures typically are created through the injection of water and chemicals into the rock formation. Several federal entities, including the EPA, recently have asserted potential regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing, and the EPA is also conducting a nationwide study into the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. In June 2015, the EPA released a draft study report for peer review and comment. The draft report did not find evidence of widespread systemic impacts to drinking water, but did find a relatively small number of site-specific impacts. The EPA noted that these results could indicate that such effects are rare or that other limiting factors exist. A final report is expected in 2016. Moreover, in April 2015, the EPA proposed regulations under the CWA to impose pretreatment standards on wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. Other federal agencies have examined and are continuing to examine hydraulic fracturing, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the White House Council for Environmental Quality. Federal agencies have also adopted or are considering additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing. For example, on March 26, 2016, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) issued a final rule, with effective dates of 2018 and 2021 for the hydraulic fracturing industry, which imposes stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, including worker exposure to sand in hydraulic fracturing.\nOn March 20, 2015 the BLM released a final rule, which is currently stayed pending further litigation, that will regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to: (i) submit detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, the depths of all usable water, estimated volume of fluid to be used, and estimated direction and length of fractures, to the BLM before hydraulically fracturing an existing well; (ii) design and implement a casing and cementing program that follows best practices and meets performance standards to protect and isolate \u201cusable\u201d water; (iii) monitor cementing operations during well construction; (iv) take remedial action if there are indications of inadequate cementing, and demonstrate to the BLM that the remedial action was successful; (v) perform a successful mechanical integrity test prior to the hydraulic fracturing operation; (vi) monitor annulus pressure during a hydraulic fracturing operation; (vii) manage recovered fluids in rigid enclosed, covered or netted and screened above-ground storage tanks, with very limited exceptions that must be approved on a case-by-case basis; (viii) disclose the chemicals used to the BLM and the public, with limited exceptions for material demonstrated to be trade secrets; and (ix) provide documentation of all of the above actions to the BLM. In addition, Congress has considered, and may in the future consider, legislation that would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Past proposed legislation would have required hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, including disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. If such legislation is adopted in the future, it would establish an additional level of regulation and impose additional costs on our operations.\nAlso, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, requirements that could restrict or impose additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Some states, municipalities, and other local governmental bodies also have purported to regulate, and in some cases prohibit, hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, Vermont and New York have banned the use of the technology. In addition, various counties and municipalities around the country have passed laws restricting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing. Our operations currently are not impacted by such laws. However, there is a risk that our operations could be adversely impacted by such laws in the future, especially since our operations are located in California, which historically has been at the forefront of environmental regulation. We will continue to monitor developments in this area.\nOn September 20, 2013, California enacted Senate Bill 4, which requires the California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (\u201cDOGGR\u201d) to promulgate regulations regulating well stimulation operations, including hydraulic fracturing and certain acid stimulation treatments. On December 30, 2014, DOGGR released its final regulations, which go into effect on July 1, 2015. The final regulations require operators to obtain a permit prior to conducting well-stimulation operations, notify DOGGR prior to the start of well stimulation treatments, and disclose various types of operational data, including the chemical composition of well-stimulation fluids, which will be made available on a publicly accessible website. Operators also are required to notify every neighboring tenant and landowner within a prescribed distance at least 30 days prior to commencing well-stimulation operations and\nto test well water and surface water suitable for drinking if requested by neighboring landowners. The regulations also require operators to evaluate and test the casing, tubing, certain equipment, and cement lining of the well borehole to ensure that the well\u2019s construction can withstand hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, operators must ensure that all potentially productive zones, zones capable of over-pressurizing the surface casing annulus, or corrosive zones are isolated and sealed to prevent vertical migration of gases or fluids behind the casing. The regulations also require operators to monitor and test the well during and after hydraulic fracturing operations to verify that no well failure has occurred. Operators also are required to monitor the California Integrated Seismic Network during and after hydraulic fracturing to determine if any earthquakes of magnitude 2.7 or greater occur within a specified area around the well. If such an earthquake occurs, further hydraulic fracturing in the area is suspended until authorized by DOGGR. Our current operations do not fall within the scope of Senate Bill 4 or the interim or final regulations. However, we will continue to monitor regulatory developments in this area.\nAs of June 4, 2013, an information gathering rule adopted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (\u201cSCAQMD\u201d), Rule 1148.2, requires well operators of onshore wells in SCAQMD\u2019s jurisdiction to notify SCAQMD before undertaking certain activities at wells, including hydraulic fracturing, and then to report information regarding chemical usage and operational data regarding those well activities. SCAQMD anticipates reviewing the information gathered under Rule 1148.2 and developing regulations if necessary to protect air quality. If SCAQMD develops regulations regarding well activities, including hydraulic fracturing, our operating costs could increase.\nPermitting. We are obligated to obtain various governmental permits and approvals to pursue our projects, and the relevant permitting and approval processes may change in ways that make them more burdensome, time-consuming and/or unpredictable. For example, following the Deepwater Horizon well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior imposed a drilling moratorium in May 2010, which delayed a planned redrill of an inactive well from Platform Gail. That moratorium was subsequently lifted for fixed-leg platforms like Platform Gail. However, additional moratoria, or similar rules promulgated by other governmental authorities, could have significant impacts on our operations in the future. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior has experienced significant delays in processing permit applications for new drilling projects. Delays in the government\u2019s permitting process could have significant impacts on the industry as a whole and our future results of operations.\nDerivatives. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Reform Act, among other things, imposes restrictions on the use and trading of certain derivatives, including energy derivatives. If, as a result of the Reform Act or its implementing regulations, capital or margin requirements or other limitations relating to our commodity derivative activities are imposed, this could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our hedging strategy. In particular, a requirement to post cash collateral in connection with our derivative positions would likely make it impracticable to implement our current hedging strategy. In addition, capital, margin and business conduct requirements and limitations imposed on our derivative counterparties could increase the costs of pursuing our hedging strategy, in part because there may be fewer counterparties participating in the market and increased counterparty costs that are passed on to us.\nTax. We could also be adversely affected by future changes to applicable tax laws and regulations. For example, proposals have been made to amend federal and/or California law to impose \u201cwindfall profits,\u201d severance or other taxes on oil and natural gas companies. If any of these proposals become law, our costs would increase, possibly materially. Significant financial difficulties currently facing the State of California may increase the likelihood that one or more of these proposals will become law.\nPresident Obama has made proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could defer or eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves significant operating risks that could adversely affect our production and could be expensive to remedy. We do not have insurance to cover all of the risks that we may face.\nOur operations are subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including:\n\u00b7\nwell blowouts;\n\u00b7\ncratering and explosions;\n\u00b7\npipe failures and ruptures;\n\u00b7\npipeline accidents and failures;\n\u00b7\ncasing collapses;\n\u00b7\nfires;\n\u00b7\nmechanical and operational problems that affect production;\n\u00b7\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; and\n\u00b7\nreleases of contaminants into the environment.\nOur offshore operations are further subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, including a dependence on a limited number of gas and water injection wells and electrical transmission lines. Moreover, because we operate in California, we are also susceptible to risks posed by natural disasters such as earthquakes, mudslides, fires and floods.\nIn addition to lost production and increased costs, these hazards could cause serious injuries, fatalities, contamination or property damage for which we could be held responsible. The potential consequences of these hazards are particularly severe for us because a significant portion of our operations are conducted offshore and in other environmentally sensitive areas, including areas with significant residential populations. We do not maintain insurance in amounts that cover all of the losses to which we may be subject, and the insurance we have may not continue to be available on acceptable terms. Moreover, some risks we face are not insurable. Also, we could in some circumstances have liability for actions taken by third parties over which we have no or limited control, including operators of properties in which we have an interest. The occurrence of an uninsured or underinsured loss could result in significant costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, maintenance activities undertaken to reduce operational risks can be costly and can require exploration, exploitation and development operations to be curtailed while those activities are being completed.\nEnhanced recovery techniques may not be successful, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our properties may provide opportunities for a CO2 enhanced recovery project, and such a project is currently being pursued at the Hastings Complex by Denbury. Risks associated with enhanced recovery techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\ngeologic unsuitability of the properties subject to the enhanced recovery project;\n\u00b7\nunavailability of an economic and reliable supply of CO2, or other shortages of equipment;\n\u00b7\nlower than expected production;\n\u00b7\nlonger than expected response times;\n\u00b7\nhigher operating and capital costs; and\n\u00b7\nlack of technical expertise.\nIf any of these risks occur, it could adversely affect the results of the affected project, our financial condition and our results of operations. We may pursue other enhanced recovery activities from time to time as well, and those activities may be subject to the same or similar risks. In addition, as discussed in \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d we have been involved in a dispute with Denbury regarding certain aspects of the agreement governing the Hastings Complex project. Any further disputes or disagreements could increase the risks associated with the project or reduce its benefits to us.\nA failure to complete successful acquisitions would limit our growth.\nBecause our oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets, our future reserves, production volumes and cash flows depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. Acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties, when attractive opportunities arise is an important component of our strategy. Our focus on the California market reduces the pool of suitable acquisition opportunities. Also, our liquidity and the lack of any market for our common stock may limit our ability to make future acquisitions. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it will be more difficult to replace our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including the risk that we will discover unanticipated liabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business or property.\nIn assessing potential acquisitions, we typically rely to a significant extent on information provided by the seller. We independently review only a portion of that information. In addition, our review of the business or property to be acquired will not be comprehensive enough to uncover all existing or potential problems that could affect us as a result of the acquisition. Accordingly, it is possible that we will discover problems with an acquired business or property that we did not anticipate at the time we completed the transaction. These problems may be material and could include, among other things, unexpected environmental problems, title defects or other liabilities. When we acquire properties on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis, we have limited or no remedies against the seller with respect to these types of problems.\nThe success of any acquisition we complete will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to accurately assess the reserves associated with the acquired properties, future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. These assessments are necessarily inexact. As a result, we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales. In addition, we may face greater risks to the extent we acquire properties in areas outside of California, because we may be less familiar with operating, regulatory and other issues specific to those areas.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits we expect from an acquisition will also depend on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired operations with ours. Our management may be required to dedicate significant time and effort to the integration process, which could divert its attention from other business concerns. The challenges involved in the integration process may include retaining key employees and maintaining key employee morale, addressing differences in business cultures, processes and systems and developing internal expertise regarding the acquired properties. Acquisitions also present risks associated with the additional indebtedness that may be required to finance the purchase price, and any related increase in interest expense or other related charges.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate in a competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas, integrating new technologies and employing skilled personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be willing and able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties than our financial resources permit, and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties. Our competitors may also enjoy technological advantages over us and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future with respect to acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing our production, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, implementing new technologies and raising additional capital.\nSignificant portions of our estimated proved reserves and production are attributable to a small number of wells, and adverse events with respect to one or more of these wells could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant portion of our production and reserves concentrated in a relatively few number of wells. As a result of this concentration, any significant adverse events with respect to one or more of these wells, including those discussed elsewhere in this section, could materially and adversely affect our reserves, production, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of contractual, regulatory and other constraints that can limit our production and increase our operating costs and thereby adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of contractual, regulatory and other operating constraints that limit the manner in which we conduct our business. These constraints affect, among other things, the permissible uses of our facilities, the availability of pipeline capacity to transport our production and the manner in which we produce oil and natural gas. These constraints can change to our detriment without our consent. These events, many of which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and could reduce estimates of our proved reserves.\nThe loss of our key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe our continued success depends in part on the collective abilities and efforts of our key personnel, including our executive officers. We do not maintain key man life insurance policies. The loss of the services of key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to find, hire and retain needed key personnel in the future, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nShortages of qualified operational personnel or field equipment and services could affect our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis, increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. From time to time, there have also been shortages of drilling rigs and other field equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased with the number of wells being drilled. These factors can also result in significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. From time to time, we have experienced some difficulty in obtaining drilling rigs, experienced crews and related services and may continue to experience these difficulties in the future. In part, these difficulties arise from the fact that the California market is not as attractive for oil field workers and equipment operators as mid-continent and Gulf Coast areas where drilling activities are more widespread. If there is a shortage of qualified operational personnel or field equipment and services, our profit margin, cash flow and operating results could be adversely affected and our ability to conduct our operations in accordance with current plans and budgets could be restricted.\nBecause we cannot control activities on properties we do not operate, we cannot control the timing of those projects. If we are unable to fund required capital expenditures with respect to non-operated properties, our interests in those properties may be reduced or forfeited.\nOther companies operated properties representing 7.2% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. Our ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties and their associated costs is limited. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital with respect to exploration, exploitation, development or acquisition activities. The success and timing of exploration, exploitation and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that may be outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\napproval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u00b7\nselection of technology.\nWhere we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular oil and natural gas project, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the project. If we are not willing and able to fund required capital expenditures relating to a project when required by the majority owner or operator, our interests in the project may be reduced or forfeited. Also, we could be responsible for plugging and abandonment and other liabilities in excess of our proportionate interest in the property.\nChanges in the financial condition of any of our large oil and natural gas purchasers or other significant counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 97% of our oil and natural gas revenues were generated from sales to two purchasers: Phillips 66 and Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company. A material adverse change in the financial condition of either of our largest purchasers could adversely impact our future revenues and our ability to collect current accounts receivable from such purchasers. We face similar counterparty risks in connection with other contracts under which we may be entitled to receive cash payments, including insurance policies and commodity derivative agreements. Major counterparties may also seek price or other concessions from us if they perceive us to be dependent on them or to lack viable alternatives.\nWe have been required to write down the carrying value of our properties in the past and may be required to do so again in the future.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploitation, development and exploration activities. Under full cost accounting rules, we perform a \u201cceiling test.\u201d This test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or \u201cceiling,\u201d of the book value of our oil and natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after-tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, calculated using the twelve month arithmetic average of the first of the month prices. If the net book value of our properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability) exceeds the ceiling, we write down the book value of the properties. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling by $437.5 million, net of income tax effects, and we recorded an impairment of our oil and gas properties in that amount. We could recognize additional impairments in the future. To the extent our acquisition and development costs increase, we will become more susceptible to ceiling test write downs in low price environments.\nAll of our producing properties are located in one state and adverse developments in that state would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur properties are located primarily in California. Any circumstance or event that negatively impacts the\nproduction or marketing of oil and natural gas in California generally, or in Southern California in particular, would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Many of our competitors have operations that are more geographically dispersed than ours, and therefore may be less subject than we are to risks affecting a particular geographic area.\nIf the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nAn effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.", "PERMNO": 91598, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "VQ"}
