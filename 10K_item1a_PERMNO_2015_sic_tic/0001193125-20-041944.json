{"cik": "949870", "company": "BOSTON BEER CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nthe risks described below should be carefully considered before deciding to invest in shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock. These are risks and uncertainties that management believes are most likely to be material and therefore are most important for an investor to consider. The Company\u2019s business operations and results may also be adversely affected by additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to it, or which it currently deems immaterial, or which are similar to those faced by other companies in its industry or business in general. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer. In that event, the market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe Company Faces Substantial Competition.\nThe market for High End beer occasions within the United States is highly competitive, due to the increasing number of domestic and international beverage companies with similar pricing and target drinkers, gains in market share achieved by domestic specialty beers and imported beers, the acquisition of craft brewers by larger brewers and the introduction and expansion of hard seltzers. Some of the largest of these competitors include AB InBev, Molson Coors, Constellation, Heineken and Mark Anthony Brands as they acquire craft brewers or introduce new domestic specialty brands and hard seltzers to many markets and expand their efforts behind existing brands. Imported beers, such as Corona\u00ae\n, Heineken\u00ae\n, Modelo Especial\u00ae\nand Stella Artois\u00ae\n, also continue to compete aggressively in the United States beer market. The Company anticipates competition among domestic craft brewers will remain strong, as many local craft brewers continue to experience growth and there were many new startups in 2019. The Company estimates there are now over 8,000 breweries in operation up from approximately 1,500 breweries in 2009. Also, existing breweries are building more capacity, adding additional local tap rooms, expanding geographically and adding more SKUs and styles. The continued growth in the sales of craft-brewed domestic beers, imported beers and hard seltzers is expected to increase the competition in the market for High End beer occasions within the United States and, as a result, prices and market share of the Company\u2019s products may fluctuate and possibly decline.\nThe Company\u2019s products compete generally with other alcoholic beverages. The Company competes with other beer and beverage companies not only for drinker acceptance and loyalty, but also for shelf, cold box and tap space in retail establishments and for marketing focus by the Company\u2019s Distributors and their customers, all of which also distribute and sell other beers and alcoholic beverage products. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors, including AB InBev, Molson Coors, Heineken and Constellation Brands, have substantially greater financial resources, marketing strength and distribution networks than the Company. Moreover, the introduction of new products by competitors that compete directly with the Company\u2019s products or that diminish the importance of\nthe Company\u2019s products to retailers or Distributors may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nFurther, the beer industry has seen continued consolidation among brewers in order to take advantage of cost savings opportunities for supplies, distribution and operations. Illustrative of this consolidation is AB InBev\u2019s $107 billion purchase of SAB Miller and the related sale by SAB Miller to Molson Coors of its 58% share of the MillerCoors joint venture with Molson Coors, as well as Heineken\u2019s acquisition of Lagunitas Brewing Company for approximately $1 billion. Also, in the last few years, both AB InBev and Molson Coors have purchased multiple regional craft breweries with the intention to expand the capacity and distribution of these breweries. Due to the increased leverage that these combined operations will have in distribution and sales and marketing expenses, the costs to the Company of competing could increase. The potential also exists for these large competitors to increase their influence with their Distributors, making it difficult for smaller brewers to maintain their market presence or enter new markets. The continuing consolidation could also reduce the contract brewing capacity that is available to the Company. These potential increases in the number and availability of competing brands, the costs to compete, reductions in contract brewing capacity and decreases in distribution support and opportunities may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nThere Is No Assurance of Continued Growth and that the Company Can Adapt to the Challenges of the Changing Competitive Environment.\nFrom 2015 to 2017, the Company experienced a decline in the demand for its products, as craft beer growth rates slowed and the hard cider category declined. In 2018 and 2019, the Company experienced increases in demand for its products, driven by growth in its Truly and Twisted Tea brands, and grew 13% and 22% respectively in depletion volume compared to prior years. The Company is targeting shipment and depletion volume growth of between 15% and 25% in 2020. The Company\u2019s ability to sustain double digit growth trends may be affected by an increasing number of competitors and markets where drinker interest is primarily in new or local products, rather than national brands. The development of new products by the Company to meet these challenges may lead to reduced sales of the Company\u2019s existing brands and there is no guarantee that these new product initiatives will generate stable long term volume. Additionally, changes in the use of media and technology are changing the economics of how to market brands to drinkers and may be diminishing the traditional competitive advantage the Company may have had in buying national media relative to smaller brands. While the Company believes that a combination of innovation, new brand messaging and exploration of new media, and increased investment and sales execution can lead to increased demand, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s actions will be successful in maintaining the Company\u2019s historical levels of profitability. Reduced sales, among other factors, could lead to lower brewery utilization, lower funds available to invest in brand support and reduced profitability, and these challenges may require a different mix and level of marketing investments to stabilize and grow volumes. A lower growth environment or periods of sales declines will present challenges for the Company to motivate and retain employees, and to maintain the current levels of distributor and retailer support of its brands, it\u2019s current brand investment levels, and current returns to shareholders, and could potentially require a review of long term organization and brewery needs. Currently, the Company believes it can continue to grow in 2020 and in future years but there is no guarantee it will be successful.\nThe Company\u2019s Advertising and Promotional Investments May Affect the Company\u2019s Financial Results but Not be Effective.\nThe Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant advertising and promotional expenditures to enhance its brands. These expenditures may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations in a particular quarter or even for the full year, and may not result in increased sales. Variations in the levels of advertising and promotional expenditures have in the past caused, and are expected in the future to continue to cause, variability in the Company\u2019s quarterly results of operations. While the Company attempts to invest only in effective advertising and promotional activities, it is difficult to correlate such investments with sales results, and there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s expenditures will be effective in building brand equity or growing long term sales.\nChanges in Public Attitudes and Drinker Tastes Could Harm the Company\u2019s Business. Regulatory Changes in Response to Public Attitudes Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe alcoholic beverage industry has been the subject of considerable societal and political attention for several years, due to public concern over alcohol-related social problems, including driving under the influence, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol, including alcoholism. As an outgrowth of these concerns, the possibility exists that advertising by beer producers could be restricted, that additional cautionary labeling or packaging requirements might be imposed, that further restrictions on the sale of alcohol might be imposed or that there may be renewed efforts to impose increased excise or other taxes on beer sold in the United States.\nThe domestic beer industry, other than the market for High End beer occasions, has experienced a slight decline in shipments over the last ten years. The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high quality, more flavorful beers, health and wellness trends and increased competition from wine and spirits companies. If consumption of the Company\u2019s products in general were to come into disfavor among domestic drinkers, or if the domestic beer industry were subjected to significant additional societal pressure or governmental regulations, the Company\u2019s business could be materially adversely affected.\nCertain states are considering or have passed laws and regulations that allow the sale and distribution of marijuana. Currently it is not possible to predict the impact of this on sales of alcohol, but it is possible that legal marijuana usage could adversely impact the demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company Is Dependent on Its Distributors.\nIn the United States, where approximately 96% of its beer is sold, the Company sells most of its alcohol beverages to independent beer Distributors for distribution to retailers and, ultimately, to drinkers. Although the Company currently has arrangements with over 400 Distributors, sustained growth will require it to maintain such relationships and possibly enter into agreements with additional Distributors. Changes in control or ownership within the current distribution network could lead to less support of the Company\u2019s products.\nContributing to distribution risk is the fact that the Company\u2019s distribution agreements are generally terminable by the Distributor on relatively short notice. While these distribution agreements contain provisions giving the Company enforcement and termination rights, some state laws prohibit the Company from exercising these contractual rights. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain its existing distribution arrangements may be adversely affected by the fact that many of its Distributors are reliant on one of the major beer producers for a large percentage of their revenue and, therefore, they may be influenced by such producers. If the Company\u2019s existing distribution agreements are terminated, it may not be able to enter into new distribution agreements on substantially similar terms, which may result in an increase in the costs of distribution.\nNo assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain its current distribution network or secure additional Distributors on terms not less favorable to the Company than its current arrangements.\nThe Company\u2019s Recent Acquisition of Dogfish Head Involves a Number of Risks, the Occurrence of Which Could Adversely Affect its Business, Financial Condition, and Operating Results.\nOn July 3, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Dogfish Head Brewery and various related operations, through the acquisition of all of the equity interests held by certain private entities in Off-Centered\nWay LLC, the parent holding company of the Dogfish Head Brewery operations. The Transaction involves certain risks, the occurrence of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results, including:\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention to integrate Dogfish Head\u2019s operations;\n\u2022 disruption to the Company\u2019s existing operations and plans or inability to effectively manage its expanded operations;\n\u2022 failure, difficulties or delays in securing, integrating and assimilating information, financial systems, internal controls, operations, production processes and products, or the distribution channel for Dogfish Head\u2019s businesses and product lines;\n\u2022 potential loss of key Dogfish Head employees, suppliers, distributors and drinkers or other adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, distributors and drinkers;\n\u2022 potential inability to fully integrate Dogfish Head\u2019s distributor into the Company\u2019s existing wholesaler network\n\u2022 adverse impact on overall profitability, if the Company\u2019s expanded operations do not achieve the growth prospects, net revenues, earnings, cost or revenue synergies, or other financial results projected in the Company\u2019s valuation models, or delays in the realization thereof;\n\u2022 reallocation of amounts of capital from the Company\u2019s other strategic initiatives;\n\u2022 inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities of the acquired operations, unanticipated costs associated with the Transaction, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\n\u2022 impacts as a result of purchase accounting adjustments, incorrect estimates made in the accounting for the Transaction or the potential future write-off\nof significant amounts of goodwill, intangible assets and/or other tangible assets if the Dogfish Head business does not perform in the future as expected, or other potential financial accounting or reporting impacts\nThe Company cannot assure that it will realize the expected benefits of the Transaction or that the acquired Dogfish Head operations will be profitable. The Company\u2019s failure to adequately manage the risks associated with the Transaction could have a material adverse effect on its business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nImpact of Changes in Drinker Attitudes on Brand Equity and Inherent Risk of Reliance on the Company\u2019s Founders in the Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head Brand Communications.\nIn addition to the societal and political risks discussed above, there is also no guarantee that the brand equities that the Company has built in its brands will continue to appeal to drinkers. Changes in drinker attitudes or demands, or competitor activity and promotion, could adversely affect the strength of the Company\u2019s brands and the revenue that is generated from that strength. It is possible that the Company could react to such changes and reposition its brands, but there is no certainty that the Company would be able to maintain volumes, pricing power and profitability. It is also possible that marketing messages or other actions taken by the Company could damage its brand equities, as opposed to building them. If such damage were to occur, it would likely have a negative effect on the financial condition of the Company.\nIn addition to these inherent brand risks, C. James Koch, the founder and Chairman of the Company, as well as the founders of Dogfish Head brand, Samuel Calagione, Founder and Brewer, Dogfish Head Brewery and Mariah Calagione, Founder and Communitarian, Dogfish Head Brewery are an integral part of the Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head brand histories, equity and current and potential future brand messaging and the Company relies on the positive public perception of these founders. The role of these founders as founders, brewers and leaders of the Company is emphasized as part of the Company\u2019s brand communication and has appeal to some drinkers. If these founders were not available to the Company to continue their active roles, their absence could negatively affect the strength of the Company\u2019s messaging and, accordingly, the Company\u2019s growth prospects. The Company and its brands may also be impacted if drinkers\u2019 views of these founders were to change negatively. If either of these were to occur, the Company might need to adapt its strategy for communicating its key messages\nregarding its traditional brewing processes, brewing heritage and quality. Any such change in the Company\u2019s messaging strategy might have a detrimental impact on the future growth of the Company.\nTurnover in Company Leadership or Other Key Positions May Lead to Loss of Key Knowledge or Capability and Adversely Impact Company Performance.\nIn early 2017, the Company\u2019s then President and Chief Executive Officer, Martin Roper, announced his plans to retire in 2018 after leading the Company for more than 17 years. In the second quarter of 2018, Dave Burwick joined as President and Chief Executive Officer. Prior to commencing that role, Mr. Burwick had an established track record of innovation and business success in the beverage and consumer goods industries and had served on Boston Beer\u2019s Board of Directors since 2005. His most recent role was Chief Executive Officer of Peet\u2019s Coffee and prior to joining Peet\u2019s, Mr. Burwick served as President of North America for Weight Watchers and in numerous leadership roles over 20 years at PepsiCo, including Chief Marketing Officer of Pepsi-Cola North America. The Company may well experience further changes in key leadership or key positions in the future. The departure of key leadership personnel, especially a Chief Executive Officer, can take from the Company significant knowledge and experience. This loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in such efforts. Attracting, retaining, integrating and developing high performance individuals in key roles is a core component of the Company\u2019s strategy for addressing its business opportunities. Attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions, such as the declining growth environment that faced the Company in prior years. Failure to attract and retain the right talent, or to manage the transition of responsibilities resulting from such turnover smoothly, would affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet its challenges and may cause the Company to miss performance objectives or financial targets.\nThe Company has Significantly Increased its Product Offerings and Distribution Footprint, which Increases Complexity and Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Results.\nThe Company has significantly increased the number of commercially available beers, hard seltzers and hard ciders that it produces. In the last five years, the Company has introduced many new beers, hard seltzers and hard ciders under the Samuel Adams, Twisted Tea, Truly Hard Seltzer, Angry Orchard and three A&S Brewing brands. In early 2019, the Company introduced new brands including Wild Leaf Hard Tea, a craft hard tea, and Tura Alcoholic Kombucha, an alcoholic kombucha tea. In July 2019, the addition of the Dogfish Head brand added over 25 styles of beer, 15 styles of distilled spirits, two brewery tap rooms, a restaurant and a boutique Inn. In January 2020, the Company opened the Samuel Adams Tap Room and small brewery in downtown Boston. The Company currently operates 10 retail locations, including eight brewery tap rooms, a cidery tasting room and a restaurant, where its beers, hard seltzers, hard ciders and distilled spirits are sold and consumed on-premise.\nThese additional brands and locations, along with the increases in demand for certain existing brands, have added to the complexity of the Company\u2019s product development process, as well as its brewing, fermenting, packaging, marketing and selling processes and retail operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will effectively manage such increased complexity, without experiencing coordination issues, and operating inefficiencies, supply shortages or control deficiencies. Such inefficiencies or deficiencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nImpact of Reliance on Company-Owned Production Facilities, Reduced Availability of Breweries Owned by Others, and Inability to Leverage Investment in the Company-Owned Breweries Could Have A Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Operations or Financial Results.\nDuring 2019, the Company brewed, fermented and packaged approximately 74% of its volume at breweries owned by the Company. The Company expects to continue to produce the majority of its domestic volume in 2020 at its Company-owned breweries. This reliance on its own breweries exposes the Company to capacity constraints and risk of disruption of supply, as these breweries are operating at or close to current capacity in peak months. Management believes that it has alternatives available to it, in the event that production at any of its\nbrewing locations is temporarily interrupted, although as volumes at the Pennsylvania Brewery increase, severe interruptions there would be problematic, particularly during peak seasons. In addition, if interruptions were to occur, the Company might not be able to maintain its current economics and could face significant delays in starting replacement brewing locations. Potential interruptions at breweries include labor issues, governmental action, quality issues, contractual disputes, machinery failures, operational shut downs or natural or unavoidable catastrophes.\nThe growth in the Company\u2019s business and product complexity and the Company\u2019s reliance on its owned breweries heighten the management challenges that the Company faces. In recent years, the Company has had product shortages and service issues. The Company\u2019s supply chain struggled under the increased volume and experienced increased operational and freight costs as it reacted. In response to these issues, the Company has significantly increased its packaging capabilities and tank capacity and added personnel to address these challenges. There can be no assurance that the Company will effectively manage such increasing complexity without experiencing future planning failures, operating inefficiencies, insufficient employee training, control deficiencies or other issues that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The prior growth of the Company, changes in operating procedures and increased complexity have required significant capital investment. To date, the Company on an overall basis has not seen operating cost leverage from these investments and there is no guarantee that it will.\nThe Company continues to avail itself of capacity at third-party breweries. During 2019, approximately 23% of the Company\u2019s annual shipment volume was brewed and/or packaged under service agreements with City Brewing Company, LLC. In selecting third party breweries for brewing services arrangements, the Company carefully weighs a brewery\u2019s capability of utilizing traditional brewing, fermenting and finishing methods, its quality control capabilities throughout the production process and sleek can packaging and automated variety packaging capability and capacity. To the extent that the Company needs to avail itself of a third-party brewing services arrangement, it exposes itself to higher than planned costs of operating under such contract arrangements than would apply at the Company-owned breweries, potential lower service levels and reliability than internal production, and potential unexpected declines in the brewing capacity available to it, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The use of such third party facilities also creates higher logistical costs and uncertainty in the ability to deliver product to the Company\u2019s customers efficiently and on time.\nAs the beer industry continues to consolidate and the Company has grown, the capacity and willingness of breweries owned by others where the Company could brew, ferment or package some of its products, if necessary, has become a more significant concern and, thus, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s needs will be uniformly met. The Company continues to work at its Company-owned breweries and with its contract brewers to attempt to minimize any potential disruptions. Nevertheless, should an interruption occur, the Company could experience temporary shortfalls in production and/or increased production and/or distribution costs and be required to make significant capital investments to secure alternative capacity for certain brands and packages, the combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. A simultaneous interruption at several of the Company\u2019s production locations or an unexpected interruption at one of the Company-owned breweries would likely cause significant disruption, increased costs and, potentially, lost sales.\nThe Company\u2019s emphasis on owning production facilities requires it to continue to make a significant level of capital expenditure to maintain and improve these facilities and to incur significant fixed operating costs to support them. In an uncertain volume environment, the Company faces the risk of not being able to support the owned brewery operating costs, if volumes were to decline. At the same time, despite making these expenditures and incurring these costs, if demand were to increase significantly, the Company could still face the risk of not being able to meet the increased demand internally.\nThe Company attempts to mitigate production and distribution risks through a combination of owned breweries and access to contract facilities, but there is no guarantee that this strategy is optimal, and it might result in short term costs and inefficiencies.\nThe Company is Dependent on Key Ingredient Suppliers, Including Foreign Sources; Its Dependence on Foreign Sources Creates Foreign Currency Exposure for the Company; The Company\u2019s Use of Natural Ingredients Creates Weather and Crop Reliability and Excess/Shortage Inventory Exposure for the Company.\nThe Company purchases a substantial portion of the raw materials used in the brewing of its products, including its malt, hops and other ingredients, from a limited number of foreign and domestic suppliers. The Company purchased most of the malt used in the production of its beer from two suppliers during 2019. Nevertheless, the Company believes that there are other malt vendors available that are capable of supplying part of its needs. The Company is exposed to the quality of the barley crop each year, and significant failure of a crop would adversely affect the Company\u2019s costs.\nThe Company predominantly uses Noble hops for its Samuel Adams lagers. Noble hops are varieties from several specific growing areas recognized for superior taste and aroma properties and include Hallertau-Hallertauer, Tettnang-Tettnanger, Hersbruck-Hersbrucker and Spalt-Spalter from Germany and Saaz-Saazer\nfrom the Czech Republic. Noble hops are rare and more expensive than most other varieties of hops. United States hops are used in most of the Company\u2019s ales. The demand for hops grown in the United States has grown due to the success and growth of craft brewers and the popularity of beer styles that include hops grown in the United States. Certain United States hops are in tight supply and prices have risen for both spot purchases and forward contract pricing, accordingly. The Company enters into purchase commitments with several hops dealers, based on the Company\u2019s projected future volumes and brewing needs. The dealers then contract with farmers to meet the Company\u2019s needs. However, the performance and availability of the hops, as with any agricultural product, may be materially adversely affected by factors such as adverse weather or pests and there is no guarantee the contracts will be fulfilled completely. Further, the use of fertilizers and pesticides that do not conform to United States regulations, the imposition of export/import restrictions (such as increased tariffs and duties) and changes in currency exchange rates could result in increased prices or shortages of acceptable hops.\nThe Company attempts to maintain up to a two-year\nsupply of essential hop varieties on-hand\nin order to limit the risk of an unexpected reduction in supply, but as the Company innovates, the availability of certain hop varieties for new products is likely significantly lower. The Company buys new hop varieties for its innovation based on its best estimate of demand and does not try to get to two-year\nsupply on hand immediately. Given the imprecision of forecasting future volumes, the Company is at hop supply risk on certain varieties if its innovations are significantly more successful than expected. The Company stores its hops in multiple cold storage warehouses to minimize the impact of a catastrophe at a single site. Hops and malt are agricultural products and therefore many outside factors, including weather conditions, farmers rotating out of hops or barley to other crops, government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture, could affect both price and supply.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting policy for hops inventory and purchase commitments is to recognize a loss by establishing a reserve to the extent inventory levels and commitments exceed management\u2019s expected future usage. The computation of the excess inventory requires management to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth, product mix, cancellation costs, among others. Actual results may differ materially from management\u2019s estimates. The Company continues to manage inventory levels and purchase commitments in an effort to maximize utilization of hops on hand and hops under commitment. However, changes in management\u2019s assumptions regarding future sales growth, product mix and hops market conditions could result in future material losses.\nThe Company uses special varieties of apples in its ciders that it believes are important for the ciders\u2019 flavor profile. These apples are sourced primarily from European and United States suppliers and include bittersweet apples from France and culinary apples from Italy and Washington state. There is limited availability of these\napples and many outside factors, including weather conditions, farmers rotating from apples to other crops, government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture, could affect both price and supply. The Company has entered into contracts to cover its expected needs for 2020 and expects to realize full delivery against these contracts.\nThe Company has not experienced material difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from its suppliers, although the Company has had to pay significantly above historical prices to secure supplies when inventory and supply have been tight.\nThe Company\u2019s new product development can also be constrained by any limited availability of certain ingredients. Growth rates higher than planned or the introduction of new products requiring special ingredients could create demand for ingredients greater than the Company can source. Although the Company believes that there are alternative sources available for some of the ingredients and packaging materials, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to acquire such ingredients or packaging materials from substitute sources on a timely or cost-effective basis, in the event that current suppliers could not adequately fulfill orders. The loss or significant reduction in the capability of a supplier to support the Company\u2019s requirements could, in the short-term, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results, until alternative supply arrangements were secured.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts for certain hops and apples are payable in Euros, Pounds Sterling and New Zealand dollars, and therefore, the Company is subject to the risk that the Euro, Pound or New Zealand dollar may fluctuate adversely against the U.S. dollar. The Company has, as a practice, not hedged this exposure, although this practice is regularly reviewed. Significant adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The cost of hops has increased in recent years due to the rising market price of hops and exchange rate changes. The continuation of these trends will impact the Company\u2019s product cost and potentially the Company\u2019s ability to meet the demand for its beers. The Company buys some other ingredients and capital equipment from foreign suppliers for which the Company also carries exposure to foreign exchange rate changes.\nThe Company is Dependent on Key Packaging Suppliers, an Increase in Packaging Costs Could Harm the Company\u2019s Financial Results.\nDuring 2018 and 2019, as the Truly brand family grew significantly and the Company experienced supply pressures on sleek cans. The demand for sleek cans in the beverage industry has significantly increased and there has been a shortage of capacity as sleek can manufacturers and sleek can contract manufacturers adjust their supply chains to accommodate this increased demand. The Company is working to increase packaging capacity to accommodate its expected needs for 2020 and currently expects to have sufficient supply and capacity to meet those needs.\nThe Company maintains competitive sources for the supply of packaging materials, such as sleek cans, non-sleek\ncans, glass and shipping cases. The Company enters into limited-term supply agreements with certain vendors in order to receive preferential pricing. In 2019, crowns and labels were each supplied by single sources. Although the Company believes that alternative suppliers are available, the loss of any of the Company\u2019s packaging materials suppliers could, in the short-term, adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position until alternative supply arrangements were secured. Additionally, there has been acquisition and consolidation activity in several of the packaging supplier networks which could potentially lead to disruption in supply and changes in economics. If packaging costs continue to increase, there is no guarantee that such costs can be fully passed along through increased prices. The Company has entered into long-term supply agreements for certain packaging materials that have shielded it from some cost increases. These contracts have varying lengths and terms and there is no guarantee that the economics of these contracts can be replicated when renewed. The Company\u2019s inability to preserve the current economics on renewal could expose the Company to significant cost increases in future years. Some of these contracts require the Company to make commitments on\nminimum volume of purchases based on Company forecasts. If the Company\u2019s needs differ significantly from its forecasts, the Company would likely incur storage costs for excess production or contractual penalties that might be significant to Company financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s Operations are Subject to Certain Operating Hazards Which Could Result in Unexpected Costs or Product Recalls That Could Harm the Company\u2019s Business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to certain hazards and liability risks faced by all brewers, such as potential contamination of ingredients or products by bacteria or other external agents that may be wrongfully or accidentally introduced into products or packaging, or defective packaging and handling. Such occurrences may create bad tasting beer, hard seltzer or hard ciders, or pose health risk to the consumer or risk to the integrity and safety of the packaging. These could result in unexpected costs to the Company and, in the case of a costly product recall, potentially serious damage to the Company\u2019s reputation for product quality, as well as product liability claims.\nThe Company Relies Upon Complex Information Systems\nThe Company depends on information technology to be able to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial and accounting reporting accuracy to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. If the Company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, the Company could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. The Company recognizes that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber-attacks and other hacking activity. The Company has dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats. However, as with all large information technology systems, the Company\u2019s systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting information, disrupting business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information. Such unauthorized access could disrupt business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, remediation costs or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, as well as litigation against the Company by third parties adversely affected by the unauthorized access. Such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial results. The Company also relies on third parties for supply of software, software and data hosting and telecommunications and networking, and is reliant on those third parties for the quality and integrity of these complex services. Failure by a third party supplier could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s ability to operate.\nAn Increase in Energy Costs Could Harm the Company\u2019s Financial Results.\nIn the last five years, the Company has experienced significant variation in direct and indirect energy costs, and energy costs could change unpredictably. Increased energy costs would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs, including increases in the cost of ingredients and supplies. The Company\u2019s future operating expenses and margins could be dependent on its ability to manage the impact of such cost increases. If energy costs increase, there is no guarantee that such costs can be fully passed along through increased prices.\nChanges in Tax, Environmental and Other Regulations, Government Shutdowns or Failure to Comply with Existing Licensing, Trade or Other Regulations Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly regulated by federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with Distributors, environmental impact of operations and other matters. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent reevaluation, varying interpretations and political debate, and inquiries from governmental regulators charged with their enforcement. In addition, any delays in federal or state government\nrequired approvals caused by federal or state government shutdowns, similar to the January 2019 federal government shutdown, could prevent new brands or innovations from getting to market on time or at all. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations to which the Company\u2019s operations are subject or any revisions to such laws and regulations or the failure to pay taxes or other fees imposed on the Company\u2019s operations and results could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of the Company\u2019s licenses, permits or approvals, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in federal and other tax rates could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThere Is No Guarantee that the Company Will Not Face Litigation that Could Harm the Company\u2019s Business.\nWhile the Company has from time to time in the past been involved in material litigation, it is not currently a party to any pending or threatened litigation, the outcome of which would be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or the results of its operations. In general, while the Company believes it conducts its business appropriately in accordance with laws, regulations and industry guidelines, claims, whether or not meritorious, could be asserted against the Company that might adversely impact the Company\u2019s results. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\nbelow.\nThe Class B Shareholder Has Significant Control over the Company\nThe Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock is not entitled to any voting rights except for the right as a class to (1) approve certain mergers, charter amendments and by-law\namendments and (2) elect a minority of the directors of the Company. Although not as a matter of right, the Class A stockholders have also been afforded the opportunity to vote on an advisory basis on executive compensation. Consequently, the election of a majority of the Company\u2019s directors and all other matters requiring stockholder approval are currently decided by C. James Koch, who is the founder and Chairman of the Company, as the holder of 100% of the voting rights to the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock. As a result, Mr. Koch is able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the composition of the board of directors, approval of equity-based and other executive compensation and other significant corporate and governance matters, such as approval of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm. This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company and makes most material transactions difficult or impossible to accomplish without the support of Mr. Koch. While Mr. Koch is currently the 100% holder of the Company\u2019s Class B Common Stock, there is nothing that prevents Mr. Koch or his heirs from transferring some or all shares of the Class B Common Stock to others.\nThe Company\u2019s Operating Results and Cash Flow May Be Adversely Affected by Unfavorable Economic, Financial and Societal Market Conditions.\nVolatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and economic conditions may directly or indirectly affect the Company\u2019s performance and operating results in a variety of ways, including: (a) prices for energy and agricultural products may rise faster than current estimates, including increases resulting from currency fluctuations; (b) the Company\u2019s key suppliers may not be able to fund their capital requirements, resulting in disruption in the supplies of the Company\u2019s raw and packaging materials; (c) the credit risks of the Company\u2019s Distributors may increase; (d) the impact of currency fluctuations on amounts owed to the Company by distributors that pay in foreign currencies; (e) the Company\u2019s credit facility, or portion thereof, may become unavailable at a time when needed by the Company to meet critical needs; (f) overall beer consumption may decline; or (g) drinkers of the Company\u2019s products may change their purchase preferences and frequency, which might result in sales declines.", "PERMNO": 82634, "SIC": 2082, "TIC": "SAM"}
