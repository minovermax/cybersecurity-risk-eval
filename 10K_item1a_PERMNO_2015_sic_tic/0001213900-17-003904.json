{"cik": "1157817", "company": "SITO MOBILE, LTD.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred a consolidated net loss of $3.3M from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and consolidated net losses for all prior periods that has resulted in our having an accumulated deficit of $140.8M as of December 31, 2016. We have not achieved profitability on an annual basis. We may not be able to reach a level of revenue to achieve profitability. If our revenues grow slower than anticipated, or if operating expenses exceed expectations, then we may not be able to achieve profitability in the near future or at all, which may depress the price of our stock.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future. Capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nGiven our strategy which requires us to invest in new product offerings, hiring plans, expectations and debt obligations that we may need additional capital, we may need to issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of common stock, including convertible preferred stock, convertible notes, stock options or warrants. The issuance of additional securities in the future will dilute the percentage ownership of then existing stockholders.\nFurthermore, any additional debt or equity or other financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain required additional capital, we may have to curtail our growth plans or cut back on existing business and, further, we may not be able to continue operations if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is dependent upon a small number of customers and the loss of any one of these customers would negatively impact our revenues and our results of operations.\nOf our revenue earned during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 19% was generated from contracts with one specific advertising agency. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, contracts with this advertising agency generated 16% of sales from continuing operations. If this customer were to terminate their business relationships with us, our future revenue and operating profits may be materially harmed.\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not consider our past results, including our recent growth rates as indicative of our future performance.\nIn addition to other risk factors listed in this section, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u25cf Seasonal variations in advertising spending;\n\u25cf fluctuations in demand for our solutions;\n\u25cf the length and associated unpredictability of our sales cycle;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of investment in the development of new technologies, features and functionality of our platform;\n\u25cf changes in the availability or price of advertising inventory;\n\u25cf the timing and success of changes in our offerings or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing or pricing of our competitors\u2019 solutions;\n\u25cf changes in government regulation applicable to our industry; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions.\nBased upon all of the factors described above, we have a limited ability to forecast our future revenue, costs and expenses, and as a result, our operating results may from time to time fall below our estimates.\nWe may not maintain our recent revenue growth.\nOur revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire new customers, gain a larger amount of advertising spend from our existing customers, continue to innovate and develop new technologies, features and functionality and increase our share of and compete successfully in the new growing mobile digital advertising markets, and we may fail to do so. Further, to accommodate growth we must continually improve and maintain our technology, systems and network infrastructure. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which would use our cash and negatively impact our gross margin or operating expenses in any particular quarter. A variety of factors outside of our control could affect our revenue growth, including changes in spend budgets of advertisers and the timing and size of their spend. Decisions by advertisers to delay or reduce their advertising spending or divert spending away from mobile advertising could slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenue. You should not consider our recent revenue growth rates as indicative of our future growth.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nWe must continue to refine and expand our business development capabilities, our systems and processes and our access to financing sources. As we grow, we must continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u25cf meet our capital needs;\n\u25cf implement, improve and expand our operational, financial, management information, risk management and other systems effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner;\n\u25cf allocate our human resources optimally;\n\u25cf identify, hire, train, motivate and retain qualified managers and employees;\n\u25cf develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors; or\n\u25cf evolve a corporate culture that is conducive to success.\nIf we do not manage our growth effectively, successfully forecast demand for our solutions or manage our expected expenses accordingly, our operating results will be harmed. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial performance may suffer.\nIf our customers do not maintain and increase their advertising spend through our platform, our revenue growth and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAdvertisers generally use multiple providers in managing advertising spend. Accordingly, we must convince our customers to use our solutions, increase their usage and spend a larger share of their advertising budgets with us, and do so on an on-going basis. We may not be successful at educating and training customers, particularly our newer customers, on the benefits of our products to increase usage and generate higher levels of advertising spend. If these efforts are unsuccessful or advertisers decide not to continue to maintain or increase their advertising spend through our platform for any other reason, then we may not attract new advertisers or our existing customers may reduce their advertising spend through or cease using our platform. Therefore, we cannot assure you that advertisers that have generated advertising spend through our platform in the past will continue to generate similar levels of advertising spend in the future or that they will continue to use our platform at all. We may not be able to replace customers who decrease or cease their usage of our platform with new customers that spend similarly on our platform. If our existing customers do not continue to use and increase their use of our platform, or if we are unable to attract sufficient advertising spend on our platform from new customers, our revenue could decline, which would materially and adversely harm our business and results of operations.\nWe generally do not have long-term agreements with our customers, and we may be unable to retain key customers, attract new customers, or replace departing customers with customers that can provide comparable revenue to us.\nOur success requires us to maintain and expand our current customer relationships and to develop new relationships. Our contracts and relationships with advertising agencies on behalf of advertisers are typically short term in nature and generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our solutions and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. As a result, we may have limited visibility into our future advertising revenue streams. We cannot assure you that our customers will continue to use our solutions, or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenue. If a major customer representing a significant portion of our business decides to materially reduce its use of our solutions or to cease using our solutions altogether, our revenue could be significantly reduced. Any non-renewal, renegotiation, cancellation or deferral of large advertising contracts, or a number of contracts that in the aggregate account for a significant amount of revenue, could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and harm our business.\nWe have identified significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address those deficiencies or if we have other significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs part of our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we identified significant deficiencies in the areas of executive expenses and executive payroll. While all employees are required to present and validate all business expenses incurred in performance of their duties with the Company, two members of management did not adhere to this policy. As a result, former management was able to use company assets for other than legitimate business purposes. Our management concluded that these deficiencies represent significant deficiencies. A \u201csignificant deficiency\u201d is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects a company\u2019s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected.\nInternal controls over financial reporting are processes designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, cause our consolidated financial statements to contain material misstatements, and harm our business and operating results. Our internal controls may not prevent all potential errors, because any control system, regardless of its design, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved.\nWe cannot assure you that in the future additional significant deficiencies and material weaknesses will not occur, exist or otherwise be identified. See remediation implementation in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our processes, procedures and controls and will make changes as management determines appropriate. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, our business and operating results may be adversely affected, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, there may be a negative effect on our stock price, and we may be subject to civil or criminal investigations and penalties.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and other business practices, and of board-level oversight, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties. Consequently, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, and this may decrease the trading price of our stock.\nWe must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and to prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties. We are responsible for reviewing and assessing our internal controls and implementing additional controls when improvement is needed. We have determined that as of the period ended December 31, 2016, which we are required to assess and report in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual report on Form 10-K that we have significant deficiencies in our internal controls, which will require us to remediate such deficiencies. Failure to implement any required changes to our internal controls or other changes we identify as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the market price of our stock.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act requirements regarding internal control over financial reporting, and other internal controls over business practices, are costly to implement and maintain, and such costs are relatively more burdensome for smaller companies such as us than for larger companies. We have limited internal personnel to implement procedures and must scale our procedures to be compatible with our resources. We also rely on outside professionals including accountants and attorneys to support our control procedures. Until fiscal year 2012 we did not have an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Governance and Nominating Committee composed of independent directors. We are working to improve all of our controls but, if our controls are not effective, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent and detect fraud and other improprieties which could lead to a decrease in the market price of our stock.\nWe are dependent upon key personnel whose loss may adversely impact our business.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued service of our management and other key personnel and our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees. If one or more of our key employees leaves the Company, we will have to find a replacement with the combination of skills and attributes necessary to execute our strategy. Because competition from other technology companies for skilled employees is intense, and the process of finding qualified individuals can be lengthy and expensive, we believe that the loss of services of key personnel could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe acquired DoubleVision in July 2014 and completed our acquisition of the assets of Hipcricket in July 2015. Our growth strategy is dependent on the success of these acquisitions and in the future we may acquire additional companies, products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or any other future acquisition, and any acquisition has numerous risks. These risks include the following:\n\u25cf difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n\u25cf difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current technologies;\n\u25cf difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to retain key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u25cf incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\n\u25cf potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality, intellectual property infringement and other legal and financial liabilities, among other things; and\n\u25cf potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nMergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and, if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors because competition in our industry is intense, and our competitors may offer solutions that are perceived by our customers to be more attractive than ours or leverage captive inventory or data to their advantage. These factors could result in declining revenue or the inability to grow our business.\nCompetition for our advertisers\u2019 advertising budgets is intense, as is competition for broader advertising solutions such as data management platforms. We operate in a market that is subject to rapid development and introduction of product and service offerings, changing branding objectives and evolving customer demands, all of which affect our ability to remain competitive. We expect competition to increase as the barriers to enter our market are low and consolidation is increasing. Increased competition may force us to charge less for our solutions, or offer pricing models that are less attractive to us and decrease our margins. Our principal competitors for our media buying solutions include traditional advertising networks, and advertising agencies that operate an agency trading desk, either directly or through an affiliate. Competitors for our solutions include other companies that offer self-service DSP and/or DMP solutions, which allow advertisers to purchase inventory directly from advertising exchanges or other third parties and manage and analyze their own consumer data and third party data. Other competitors for our solutions include in-house tools and custom solutions currently used by brand advertisers to manage their customer data and advertising and marketing activities. We also face competition in our location based solutions from other company\u2019s such as: xAd, PlaceIQ, NinthDecimal, MaxPoint, and 4INFO. As our platforms evolve and we introduce new technologies, features and functionality, we may face competition from new sources.\nWe also compete with services offered through large online portals that have significant brand recognition, such as Yahoo!, Google, and Facebook. These large portals have substantial proprietary digital advertising inventory that may provide them with competitive advantages, including far greater access to Internet user data, and the ability to significantly influence pricing for digital advertising inventory. Furthermore, these portals may not offer some of their premium, or even all of their inventory, for sale, but instead, use it in their own captive advertising activities. We also compete for a share of advertisers\u2019 total advertising budgets with online search advertising, for which we do not offer a solution, and with traditional advertising media, such as direct mail, broadcast television, radio, cable and print. Some of our competitors have also established reputations for specific services, such as retargeting with dynamic creative, for which we do not have an established market presence. Many current and potential competitors have competitive advantages relative to us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger client bases, greater access to advertising inventory on premium websites and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. Increased competition may result in reduced pricing for our solutions, longer sales cycles or a decrease of our market share, any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nWe must develop new product offerings and introduce enhancements that include new features and functionality that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with technological developments to remain competitive in our evolving industry.\nWe operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry and legal standards. The introduction of new advertising solutions by our competitors, the market acceptance of solutions based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new advertising industry standards could render our platform obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully, attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing platform and to continually introduce or acquire new technologies and features and functionality demanded by the market we serve. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on many factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, appropriate introduction and market acceptance. Any new solution, product or feature that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If we are unable to anticipate or timely and successfully develop or acquire new offerings or features or enhance our existing platform to meet evolving customer requirements, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nFurther, the planned timing and introduction of new products and services are subject to risks and uncertainties. Unexpected technical, operational, deployment, distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of new products and services, which could result in a loss of, or delay in, revenues.\nAn adverse trend in sales during the holiday season could affect our financial results.\nHistorically, a high percentage of our annual sales have been attributable to the winter holiday selling season. In contrast, a substantial portion of our expenses are personnel related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, and benefits, which are not seasonal in nature. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on our results from operations in the short term.\nAny forecasts of market growth that we have provided or may provide in the future may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, which may not prove to be accurate. Forecasts relating to the expected growth in advertising and other markets, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.\nWe may not be able to adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use, and we may become subject to claims that we infringe on others\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other arrangements with employees, actual and prospective customers and actual or prospective capital providers and their agents and advisors, and other protective measures to preserve our proprietary rights. These measures afford only limited protection and may not preclude competitors from developing products or services similar or superior to ours. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nAlthough we implement protective measures and intend to defend our proprietary rights, our efforts may not be successful. From time to time, we may litigate within the United States or abroad to enforce our issued or licensed patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of others. Enforcing or defending our proprietary rights can involve complex factual and legal questions and can be expensive, would require management\u2019s attention and might not bring us timely or effective relief.\nFurthermore, third parties may assert that our products or processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Although there are no pending or threatened intellectual property lawsuits against us, we may face litigation or infringement claims in the future. Infringement claims could result in substantial judgments, and could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if we ultimately prevail. A third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other equitable relief which could effectively block our use of allegedly infringing intellectual property. Although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing, we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.\nWe may not be able to effectively protect or monetize our patents.\nWe have 30 patents which were issued from May 2006 to March 2017 related to mobile search, commerce, advertising and streaming media. To monetize some or all of our patents through sales of one or more patents would require access to potential buyers, which may be difficult for a smaller company such as us to obtain, and would also require completion of a buyer\u2019s due diligence investigation into the strength of our patents, demonstration to the buyer that owning such patents would have defensive or offensive value, and negotiation of the price and other terms of transaction documents.\nTo monetize some or all of the patents by licensing would require similar steps. In addition, we may not be able to monetize our patents against companies who use our patented inventions unless they respect our ability to enforce our patents against them if they were not to agree to licenses.\nTo prosecute patent infringement actions may require us to commit the Company\u2019s cash resources to incur substantial legal fees and costs. The outcome of litigation is never certain, and the amount of damages that might be awarded to us under any judgment is also uncertain. Even if a judgment is obtained it would be subject to appeal and to the uncertainties of collection. In addition, companies whose actual or planned activities are blocked by our patents could attempt to develop technological work-arounds in order to avoid compensating us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively protect or monetize our patents, or that we will be able to obtain a return equal to the fair intrinsic value of the patents. Any effort to obtain monetization could entail significant expenses and also opportunity costs.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from developing our products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives and subject us to substantial monetary damages.\nThird parties could, in the future, assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to products we develop. Whether a product infringes a patent or misappropriates other intellectual property involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Our potential competitors may assert that some aspect of our product infringes their patents. Because patent applications may take years to issue, there also may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents upon which our products could infringe. There also may be existing patents or pending patent applications of which we are unaware upon which our products may inadvertently infringe.\nAny infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patents in such claim were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe them, we could be prohibited from selling any product that is found to infringe unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent. We may be unable to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. A court could also order us to pay compensatory damages for such infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in addition, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us and our customers from making, using, or selling products, and could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities. Depending on the nature of the relief ordered by the court, we could become liable for additional damages to third parties.\nWe may be unable to comply with the liquidity covenant in the Fortress Agreement.\nOn October 3, 2014, we entered into a Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement (the \u201cFortress Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, SITO Mobile Solutions, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, SITO Mobile R&D IP, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortress Credit Co. LLC, and CF DB EZ LLC (the \u201cRevenue Participant\u201d). Pursuant to the Fortress Agreement, among other things, we sold to the Revenue Participant the right to receive a portion of any revenue received from the monetization of our patents, in an aggregate amount of up to $5,000,000 (if the Notes are paid in full prior to March 31, 2018) or $7,500,000 (if the Notes are not paid in full prior to March 31, 2018), subject to the terms of the Fortress Agreement. Under the Fortress Agreement, we are required to maintain at least $1,000,000 in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Any failure to comply with this covenant may be deemed an event of default under the Fortress Agreement, which may result in the purchasers declaring all outstanding amounts due under the senior secured notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) issued thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Such an event may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Fortress Agreement restricts our ability to monetize our patents.\nUnder the Fortress Agreement, we may not dispose of any of our patents, without the written consent of the Majority Purchasers. As a result, we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities to monetize our patents that we consider potentially profitable. This restriction may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSITO Mobile, our former chief executive officer, and our former chief financial officer, have been named as parties to various lawsuits arising out of, or related to, alleged violations of various federal securities laws and SEC rules and regulations and those lawsuits could adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows to suffer.\nA putative federal securities class action complaint has been filed against us and certain of our former officers and directors, as detailed more fully in Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\nThe ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain. Either favorable or unfavorable outcomes could have a material negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations, due to defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations, which could subject our business to higher tax liability.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carry-forwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. At December 31, 2016, we had gross, pretax U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forwards, or NOLs, of $40 million. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership could result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law. On April 3, 2017, our Board adopted a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in an effort to diminish the risk that the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryovers or \u201cNOLs\u201d to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited. We have recorded a valuation allowance related to our NOLs and other net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets. Our NOLs may expire unutilized or underutilized, which would prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nRisks Relating to our Industry\nDemand for the services we provide is not yet well established.\nBrand owners who are potential users of the services we provide must weigh their decisions in light of limited budgets for marketing and notification, the inertia of dealing with well-established providers of traditional modalities for marketing and notification, lack of experience with services such as ours and the perception (whether or not well founded) of technological risk and not-fully-demonstrated cost-effectiveness of our services. There are indications that the market among major brand owners for services such as ours is in an early stage of development.\nSystem or network failures could reduce our sales, increase costs or result in a loss of end users of our products and services.\nAny failure of, or technical problem with, carriers\u2019 or third parties\u2019 billing systems, delivery or information systems, or communications networks could result in the inability of end users to receive communications or download our products, prevent the completion of a billing transaction, or interfere with access to some aspects of our products. If any of these systems fail or if there is an interruption in the supply of power, an earthquake, superstorm, fire, flood or other natural disaster, or an act of war or terrorism, end users might be unable to access our offerings. For example, from time to time, our carriers have experienced failures with their billing and delivery systems and communication networks, including gateway failures that reduced the provisioning capacity of their branded e-commerce system. Any failure of, or technical problem with, the carriers\u2019, third parties\u2019 or our systems could cause us to lose end users or revenues or incur substantial repair costs and distract management from operating our business, or persuade retailers or brand owners that solutions utilizing our programs are not sufficiently reliable. This, in turn, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMaterial defects or errors in our platform could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our platform.\nThe software applications underlying our platform are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, which may cause disruptions in availability, misallocation of advertising spend or other performance problems. Any such errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our platform could negatively impact our business and our customers\u2019 businesses or the success of their advertising campaigns and cause customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation. If we have any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our platform, customers may reduce their usage or delay or withhold payment to us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or lengthen our collection cycles for accounts receivable. Such performance problems could also result in customers making warranty or other claims against us, our giving credits to our customers toward future advertising spend or costly litigation. As a result, material defects or errors in our platform could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nOur business model depends upon our ability to continue to access advertising inventory that we do not own.\nOur platform depends on access to advertising inventory controlled by publishers and various other providers, such as public ad exchanges, supply-side platforms, private marketplaces, ad networks and direct premium publishers. In particular, we rely on continued access to premium ad inventory in high-quality and brand-safe environments, viewable to consumers across multiple screens. We do not own the inventory of advertising opportunities upon which our business depends and, therefore, we might not always have access to advertising inventory of sufficient quality or volume to meet the needs of our customers\u2019 campaigns. As a result, we may have limited visibility to our future access to inventory. Companies such as ad networks make media buying commitments to publishers, and may compete with us and restrict our access to media inventory of those publishers. Companies such as ad exchanges charge both publishers and advertisers fees and may be able to charge advertisers lower fees than us. In addition, many publishers sell a portion of their advertising inventory directly to advertisers, and publishers may seek to do so increasingly in the future. If that were to occur, we may have fewer opportunities to provide our customers access to inventory, which would harm our ability to grow our business and our financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, as the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from real-time bidding technologies, or RTB exchanges and that utilize advertising solutions providers continues to increase, intermediaries or their bidding processes may favor other bidders and we may not be able to compete successfully for advertising inventory available on RTB exchanges. Even if our bids are successful, the inventory may be of low quality or misrepresented to us, despite our attempts to prevent fraud and conduct quality assurance checks on inventory and we could be subject to liability and our business could be harmed.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on our ability to collect and use significant amounts of data to deliver ads, and any limitations on the collection and use of this data could significantly diminish the value of our solutions.\nOur ability to optimize the placement and scheduling of advertisements for our buyers and to increase adoption of our solutions depends on our ability to successfully leverage data that we collect from our buyers, sellers, and third-parties such as data providers. Our ability to successfully leverage such data, in turn, depends on our ability to collect and obtain rights to utilize such data.\nWhen we deliver an ad, we are often able to collect anonymous information about the placement of the ad and the interaction of the user with the ad. We, and our third-party data providers, currently employ various tracking technologies, such as cookies, pixels and automatic content recognition technology, to collect the data we use to conduct ad campaigns. These tracking technologies are used to collect information related to the consumer, such as demographic information and history of the consumer\u2019s interactions with our advertisers\u2019 and our sellers\u2019 websites, and any ads we deliver. We may also be able to collect information about the user\u2019s location. As we collect and aggregate this data provided by billions of ad impressions and the data acquired from third-party providers, we analyze it in order to optimize the placement and delivery of ads across the advertising inventory provided to us by sellers.\nFurther, ad-blocking technologies have emerged that have the effect of blocking the display of an advertisement. Estimates of the use of ad-blocking technologies vary by user population, type of media content, geography, and other factors, and the ultimate prevalence and effect of ad-blocking technologies is not certain, but it could have an adverse effect on our business if it reduces the volume or effectiveness (and therefore value) of advertising. In addition, some ad-blocking technologies block only ads that are targeted through use of third-party data, while allowing ads based on first-party data (i.e. data owned by the provider of the website or application being viewed). These ad-blockers could place us at a disadvantage because we rely on third-party data, while large competitors have troves of first-party data they use to direct advertising. Other technologies allow ads that are deemed \u201cacceptable,\u201d which could be defined in ways that place us or our clients at a disadvantage, particularly if such technologies are controlled or influenced by our competitors. Even if ad-blockers do not ultimately have a material impact on our business, investor concerns about ad blockers could cause our stock price to decline.\nFinally, network carriers, providers of mobile device operating systems, and device manufacturers may also impact our ability to collect data on internet-connected devices. These carriers, operating system providers, and device manufacturers are increasingly promoting features that allow device users to disable some of the functionality of the device or its operating system, which may impair or disable the collection of data on their devices. Any interruptions, failures, or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis, and storage systems could limit our ability to aggregate and analyze user data from our clients\u2019 advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our buyers, which could make our solutions less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose clients and our revenue may decline.\nIncreased prevalence of ad-blocking has prompted examination of the effect of digital advertising industry practices upon the quality of user experiences, and changes in industry practices may emerge as a result. Such changes could reduce the viability of our existing business model, place us at a competitive disadvantage, or require us to invest significantly in developing new technologies and business practices.\nIf we fail to detect fraudulent or unacceptable ad placements, or if we serve advertisements on websites with inappropriate content, our reputation will be damaged, advertisers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, and we may incur liabilities.\nOur business depends in part on providing our advertisers with services that are trusted and safe for their brands and that provide the anticipated value. We frequently have contractual commitments to take reasonable measures to prevent advertisements from appearing on websites with inappropriate content or on certain websites that our advertisers may identify. Our advertisers also expect that ad placements will not be misrepresented, such as auto-play in banner placements marketed as pre-roll inventory, and that ad impressions represent the legitimate activity of human internet users. We use proprietary technologies in our efforts to detect and block inventory on websites with inappropriate content, misrepresented ad placements and fraudulent bot generated impressions. However, technologies utilized by bad actors are constantly evolving and preventing and combating fraud and inappropriate content, which is an industry-wide issue requires constant vigilance and investment of time and resources. There has recently been a significant amount of negative publicity about bot generated impressions within our industry, so our ability to combat bot generated impressions has become increasingly important. We may not always be successful in our efforts to prevent and combat fraud and inappropriate content. We may serve advertisements on inventory that is objectionable to our advertisers, and our software may also inadvertently purchase inventory on behalf of our advertisers that proves to be unacceptable for advertising campaigns, such as fraudulent bot generated impressions. In addition, negative publicity around fraudulent digital advertising placements may adversely impact the perceptions of advertisers regarding programmatic purchasing of digital advertising. As a result, we may lose the trust of our advertisers, which would harm our brand and reputation, our advertisers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may be exposed to liabilities or the need to provide credits or refunds, and our business and financial performance may be harmed.\nIf our information systems are disrupted or unauthorized access to customer data or our data is otherwise obtained, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, our reputation could be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.\nWe collect, store and transmit information of, or on behalf of, our advertisers. Security breaches could result in the loss of information or financial assets, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. While we have security measures in place, our information systems and networks and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk and ongoing threats. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including cyber-attacks such as viruses, hacking, phishing attacks or other intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. This could result in one or more third parties obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data, our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our financial assets. Such attacks may also cause interruptions to the services we provide and cause customers to lose confidence in our platform. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. To date, unauthorized users have not had a material impact on our systems; however, there can be no assurance that such attacks may not be successful in the future.\nThird parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including intellectual property and other confidential business information or our financial assets. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent other security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose potential sales and existing customers or we could be subject to liability.\nIn addition we utilize third-party cloud computing services in connection with our operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party hosting/cloud computing providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact our business and results of operations, our ability to accurately report our financial results, as well as the experience of our customers. As we expand our operations, we expect to utilize additional systems and service providers that may also be essential to managing our business. Although the systems and services that we require are typically available from a number of providers, it is time consuming and costly to qualify and implement these relationships. Therefore, our ability to manage our business would suffer if one or more of our providers suffer an interruption in their business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in their operations, or we have to change or add systems and services. We may not be able to control the quality of the systems and services we receive from third-party service providers, which could impair our ability to maintain proper controls over financial reporting and complete timely and accurate financial reporting, and may impact our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nLegislation and regulation of online businesses, including privacy and data protection regimes, is expansive, not clearly defined and rapidly evolving. Such regulation could create unexpected costs, subject us to enforcement actions for compliance failures, or restrict portions of our business or cause us to change our technology platform or business model.\nGovernment regulation may increase the costs of doing business online. Federal, state, municipal and foreign governments and agencies (although we do not currently have operations outside of the U.S. and Canada, in the future, some of our activities may also be subject to the laws of other foreign jurisdictions) have adopted and could in the future adopt, modify, apply or enforce laws, policies, and regulations covering user privacy, data security, technologies that are used to collect, store and/or process data, advertising online, the use of data to inform advertising, the taxation of products and services, unfair and deceptive practices, and the collection (including the collection of information), use, processing, transfer, storage and/or disclosure of data associated with unique individual Internet users. Although we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data, such as name, email address, address, phone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, financial data or health data, we typically do collect and store IP addresses and other device identifiers, which are or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation. In addition, certain U.S. laws impose requirements on the collection and use of information from or about users or their devices. For instance, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, imposes requirements on website operators and online services that are aimed at children under the age of 13 years of age. COPPA requires notice and parental consent to include persistent identifiers for behavioral advertising and other tracking across websites. Other existing laws may in the future be revised, or new laws may be passed, to impose more stringent requirements on the use of identifiers to collect user information, including information of the type that we collect. Changes in regulations could affect the type of data that we may collect, restrict our ability to use identifiers to collect information, and, thus, affect our ability to collect data, the costs of doing business online, and affect the demand for our platform, the ability to expand or operate our business, and harm our business.\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators also may implement \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d legislation, particularly if the industry does not implement a standard (discussed above). The California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 requires operators of commercial websites and online service providers, under certain circumstances, to disclose in their privacy policies how such operators and providers respond to browser \u201cdo not track\u201d signals.\nIn addition, we may inadvertently receive personal information from advertisers or advertising agencies or through the process of executing video advertising campaigns or usage of our platform. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect personal data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of our officers and public censure, claims for damages by consumers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial performance and business. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our solution by current and future advertisers and advertising agencies.\nIn addition, data security is of increasing concern to U.S., state and foreign regulators, and, as a result, the legal standards for data security and the consequences for violating those standards continue to evolve and the threat posed by cyber-attacks and data breaches continues to grow. While we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use, and disclose in the operation of our business, and to offer certain privacy protections with respect to such information, such measures may not always be effective.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nActions of activist stockholders against us could be disruptive and costly and the possibility that activist stockholders may wage proxy contests or seek representation on, or control of, our Board could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business and an activist campaign that results in a change in control of our Board could trigger change in control provisions or payments under certain of our material contracts and agreements.\nStockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or board nominations or otherwise attempt to effect changes, assert influence or acquire some level of control over us.\nOn April 7, 2017, Stephen D. Baksa, purported to notify the Company that he intends to nominate five (5) candidates for election to our Board at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or the 2017 Annual Meeting, which, if elected, would replace the entire membership of the five-member SITO Board. According to the Schedule 13D filed with the SEC by Mr. Baksa and Thomas Candelaria (the \u201cBaksa 13D Group\u201d) on April 13, 2017, Messrs. Baksa and Candelaria beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 6.8% of our outstanding common stock.\nAlso on April 7, 2017, TAR Holdings LLC, an entity for which Karen Singer serves as the sole member, purported to notify the Company that it intends to nominate three (3) candidates for election to our Board at our 2017 Annual Meeting, which, if elected, would constitute more than a majority of the members of the SITO Board. According to the Schedule 13D filed with the SEC by Ms. Singer and TAR Holdings LLC (the \u201cSinger 13D Group\u201d), Ms. Singer and TAR Holdings LLC beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 10.2% of our outstanding common stock.\nOn April 12, 2017, Stephen D. Baksa, Thomas Candelaria, Michael Durden, Itzhak Fisher, Thomas J. Pallack, Matthew Stecker and Thomas Thekkethala (the \u201cBaksa Consent Group\u201d) filed a Preliminary Consent Statement on Schedule 14A (the \u201cPreliminary Consent Statement\u201d) with the SEC in connection with their intended solicitation of consents from the stockholders of SITO to, among other things, remove all but one of the current members of the SITO Board and replace them with their own nominees. According to the Preliminary Consent Statement, the Baksa Consent Group beneficially owns in the aggregate approximately 6.8% of our outstanding common stock.\nWhile our Board and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of the Company\u2019s stockholders, including Mr. Baksa, Mr. Candelaria, and Ms. Singer, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all stockholders and the depth and breadth of our Board, an activist campaign such as those threatened by the Baksa 13D Group and the Singer 13D Group that seeks to replace more than a majority of the members of our Board and, thereby seek control of the SITO Board, could have an adverse effect on us because:\n\u25cf Responding to such actions by activist stockholders can disrupt our operations, are costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management team from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u25cf Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential clients, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners;\n\u25cf These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business\n\u25cf If individuals are elected to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders; and\nIf an activist campaign that seeks to replace at least a majority of the members of the Board, such as those that are currently being threatened by the Baksa 13D Group and the Singer 13D Group, was successful, a change in control of the Board may be deemed to have occurred under certain of our material contracts and agreements, and such a change in control may trigger certain fundamental change and/or change in control provisions, payments, and/or redemptions under certain of our outstanding indebtedness, our employment agreements with our named executive officers, our equity compensation plans and possibly other of our plans and agreements\nTrading in our stock has been modest, so investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing prices. Moreover, modest volume can increase stock price volatility.\nBecause there is a limited trading in our common stock, it may be difficult for investors to sell or buy substantial quantities of shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Moreover, the market price for shares of our common stock may be made more volatile because of the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock. When trading volume is low, significant price movement can be caused trading a relatively small number of shares.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nCommon stock prices are often significantly influenced by the research and reports that securities analysts publish about companies and their business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If our common stock is covered by securities analysts and our stock is downgraded, our stock price will likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we can lose visibility in the financial markets, which can cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our operating results (including whether we have achieved our key business targets and/or earnings estimates) and prospects;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, business successes, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market (particularly if overall trading volume is not high);\n\u25cf actual or anticipated monetization of our patents;\n\u25cf general market conditions and broader political and economic conditions; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies, and in particular the market prices of stock in smaller companies and technology companies have been highly volatile. The market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nWe do not expect any cash dividends to be paid on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, as well as any capital that may be raised in the future, to fund business growth. Consequently, a stockholder\u2019s only opportunity to achieve a return on investment would be for the price of our common stock to appreciate. We cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 105,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2016, there were 20,681,047 shares of our common stock outstanding and 1,912,387 options to issue shares of our common stock outstanding.\nThe holders of such options can be expected to exercise them at a time when our common stock is trading at a price higher than the exercise price of these outstanding options. If these options to purchase our common stock are exercised, or other equity interests are granted under our 2008, 2009 or 2010 stock plans, or under other plans or agreements adopted in the future, such equity interests will have a dilutive effect on your ownership of common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. Such securities may be issued at below-market prices or, in any event, prices that are significantly lower than the price at which you may have paid for your shares. The future issuance of any such securities may create downward pressure on, or dampen any upward trend in, the trading price of our common stock.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions, and our Board of Directors has adopted a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement, any of which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board that some stockholders may consider favorable.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions, and our Board of Directors recently adopted a Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement with an expiration date of April 3, 2020 and an ownership trigger threshold of 4.99%, any of which could render more difficult, or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by our Board of Directors. The Section 382 Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, however, should not interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by our Board of Directors. Nor does the rights agreement prevent our Board of Directors from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders.", "PERMNO": 15644, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "SITO"}
