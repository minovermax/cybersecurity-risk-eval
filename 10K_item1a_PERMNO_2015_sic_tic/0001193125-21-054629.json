Because our business is subject to many risks and our actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us, this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nas well as our other publicly available filings with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nOur business is substantially dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta, and the commercial success of Oxbryta or any future drug we may develop or obtain will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community and marketplace.\nOur business depends heavily on our ability to successfully commercialize our first approved product, Oxbryta, for the treatment of sickle cell disease, or SCD. Oxbryta or any future drug of ours approved for commercial sale may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community and marketplace. If Oxbryta or any other approved drug does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenue from drug sales and we may not become profitable. Before granting reimbursement approval, healthcare payors may require us to demonstrate that the drug, in addition to treating the target indication, also provides incremental health benefits to patients. For example, there have been numerous instances of government and private payors placing restrictions on coverage for products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the FDA\u2019s Subpart H regulations, or Subpart H. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors about the benefits of Oxbryta or any future drug approved for commercial sale will require significant resources and may never be successful. The degree of market acceptance of Oxbryta and any other approved drugs that we may pursue will depend on a wide range of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe demonstrated efficacy and potential advantages of our drugs compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our drugs for sale at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of administration of our drugs compared to alternative current and future treatments;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the SCD or other target patient populations to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u2022\nthe availability of our drugs and our ability to meet market demand, including a reliable supply for long-term chronic treatment;\n\u2022\nthe strength of labeling, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications and approved labeling for which the drug is approved, including labeling restrictions for drugs approved under Subpart H, such as Oxbryta;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects and overall safety profile of the drug; and\n\u2022\nany restrictions on the use of the drug, including together with other medications.\nFor example, shortly after we launched Oxbryta, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,\nwhich causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),\nevolved into a global pandemic that has significantly impacted people and entities throughout the world. In light of the COVID-19\npandemic, we temporarily\nsuspended our field team from most in-person\ninteractions, including visits to physician offices, clinics and hospitals as well as in-person\nmeetings with payors. The COVID-19\npandemic has also reduced our ability to engage with the medical and investor communities. These and other measures have impacted our ability to commercialize Oxbryta and may significantly impact our business in general, and we may continue to experience disruptions to our commercial efforts as well as other disruptions that could materially impact our business.\nIf our sales and marketing capabilities for Oxbryta in the United States are not effective, or we are unable to establish or secure effective sales and marketing capabilities for any future drug approved for commercial sale in the United States or another geographic market, we may be unsuccessful in our commercial efforts.\nIn 2019, we established the infrastructure we believed was adequate for the commercial launch of Oxbryta in the United States, which occurred in December 2019. This included establishing a sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize Oxbryta in the United States. Our commercialization of Oxbryta in the United States will continue to be expensive, difficult, risky and time consuming, and we may not deploy or have adequate resources over time to support the successful commercialization of Oxbryta. Any failures or delays in our commercial efforts, including with respect to any changes in related resources or activities following launch, could adversely impact the commercialization of Oxbryta or any other products, if any are approved.\nAlthough many of our employees have experience with commercializing products while employed at other companies, our 2019 launch of Oxbryta is our first experience marketing and selling a drug together as a management team. To successfully commercialize Oxbryta or any other drugs we may develop or obtain, we will need to continue to develop and strengthen our commercial capabilities, either on our own or with others. Our initial estimate of the size of the required sales force may be materially more or less than the size of the sales force actually required to effectively commercialize Oxbryta or any other product candidates, if any. For example, we may have hired substantially more sales representatives than required and may incur excess costs as a result.\nIn light of the COVID-19\npandemic, we have temporarily suspended our field team from most in-person\ninteractions, including visits to physician offices, clinics and hospitals as well as in-person\nmeetings with payors. While we are continuing to engage with healthcare professionals and payors through digital and internet-based education and outreach, the impact of temporarily suspending our field force from in-person\ninteractions is unknown. We have seen a significant decrease in weekly new patient prescriptions for Oxbryta from a peak in early March, and we expect the rate of new patient prescriptions may remain lower, depending on the course of the pandemic.\nAnother potential challenge for our commercial efforts is frequency of doctor visits by SCD patients. We believe that nearly half of Medicaid and Medicare patients living with SCD do not see a hematologist at least once per year. This infrequency of doctor visits, which has been exacerbated during the COVID-19\npandemic, may impede prescriptions for Oxbryta.\nWith respect to certain geographical markets, we may seek to enter into collaborations with other entities to utilize their local marketing and distribution capabilities, but we may be unable to enter into such agreements on favorable terms, if at all. If our future collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize Oxbryta or future drugs, if any, and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business. We may also be competing with companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. For example, in November 2019, the FDA approved Novartis\u2019 biologic, crizanlizumab, for the reduction of the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, or VOCs, in patients with SCD, and, in October 2020, Novartis announced that the European Commission approved crizanlizumab for the prevention of recurrent VOCs in patients with SCD. Without an effective internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we would be unable to compete successfully against more established companies, and our commercial efforts and ability to generate revenues would be impaired.\nOur profitability will depend significantly on our ability to sell sufficient amounts of product at competitive prices and on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement through governmental or private third-party payors. The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain in the United States and elsewhere, and failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for Oxbryta or any other products we may develop due to price controls, resource constraints or reimbursement limitations could limit our ability to market those products and impair our ability to generate revenue.\nOur target patient populations are small, and, accordingly, the pricing, coverage and reimbursement of Oxbryta or any of our product candidates, if approved, must be adequate to support our commercial infrastructure. To achieve profitability, our per-patient\nprices must be sufficient to recover our development and manufacturing costs, and we must be able to sell sufficient amounts of product at these prices. Additionally, the availability of government funded or private insurance coverage for Oxbryta and any other product candidates for any approved indications, if any, and the extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors, will be essential for most patients to be able to afford Oxbryta or any of our other specialty products, if approved. In particular, the list price for Oxbryta in the United States is $125,000 per year, and a significant percentage of patients with SCD in the United States rely on government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for their coverage of drugs and other medical care, so the availability of federal and state coverage of Oxbryta is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts for Oxbryta in the United States. Sales of Oxbryta or any future drug we may develop or obtain will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of such drugs will be paid by third party payors, like private health insurers, including health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, and government health administration programs. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Oxbryta or any future drug we may develop or obtain. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drug products, and even more uncertainty related to the insurance coverage for products, such as Oxbryta, that receive accelerated approval by the FDA under Subpart H (including in the period before required post-marketing confirmatory studies to verify clinical benefit). The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved\nproducts for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor\u2019s reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate or may require co-payments\nthat patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor.\nIn the United States, significant decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and federal and state programs enter into contracts with drug manufacturers for discounted drug prices for Medicare, VA/Federal Supply Schedule, 340B and Medicaid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, among others. The practices and requirements relating to these arrangements are highly complex and subject to differing regulatory requirements and time frames, which will impact the commercialization of Oxbryta. For example, payment of rebates by drug manufacturers for Medicaid purchases are determined by each state, and in some cases, if a company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a \u201cprior authorization\u201d procedure that requires state agency approval to qualify a doctor\u2019s prescription for reimbursement. Limitations could also come from entities such as local Medicare carriers, fiscal intermediaries, or Medicare Administrative Contractors. Further, Medicare Part D, which provides a pharmacy benefit to certain Medicare patients, does not require participating prescription drug plans to cover all drugs within a class of products. Our business could be materially adversely affected if private or governmental payors, including Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, were to limit access to, or deny or limit reimbursement of, Oxbryta or any of our product candidates, if approved.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the potential pricing and usage of Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems, and changes to these regulations over time contribute to uncertainty regarding the ability to obtain pricing and usage approvals for our product candidates outside of the United States. In addition, the prices of medicines under such systems are, in general, substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates outside of the United States. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.\nIn many non-U.S.\njurisdictions, including some countries in the European Union, or EU, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country and products may be subject to continuing governmental control following approval. For example, reimbursement in the European Union, or EU, must be negotiated on a country-by-country\nbasis and, in many countries, the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. Furthermore, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use, including by approving a specific price for the medicinal product or adopting a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In addition, to obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies, or to meet other criteria for pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products or product candidates.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and levels of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for Oxbryta or our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative and political changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. For example, third-party payors are increasingly requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies, benchmarking against other therapies, seeking performance-based discounts, and challenging the prices charged. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for Oxbryta or any other product we commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate, as increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, drug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are or may be sold, and drug pricing and other healthcare costs continue to be subject to intense political and social pressures that we anticipate will continue and escalate on a global basis.\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize and obtain reimbursement for Oxbryta and our product candidates in markets within and outside of the United States and Europe. If reimbursement for Oxbryta, or our product candidates, if approved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount,\nor if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, in the United States or, based on the large population of patients with SCD who reside in foreign countries, abroad, our business and operations may be harmed, our stock price may be adversely impacted and experience periods of volatility, we may have difficulty raising funds and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to penetrate foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\nOur current plans include the pursuit of commercialization for Oxbryta in Europe, the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, region and Latin America. If we commercialize Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting, compliance and legal requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection times;\n\u2022\nlonger lead times for shipping;\n\u2022\nlanguage barriers for technical training;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and related prevalence of bioequivalent or generic alternatives to therapeutics;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\npotential resource constraints, including with respect to patients\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets; and\n\u2022\nthe interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nAny of these factors could impair our ability to commercialize Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain outside the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWith the FDA approval of Oxbryta, and with respect to any other product candidate that receives regulatory approval in any jurisdiction, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and scrutiny, which may include significant restrictions relating to product labeling, distribution or other post-marketing requirements.\nEven if a product candidate is approved, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on its indicated uses, approved labeling, distribution or marketing or may impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. For example, because the FDA approved Oxbryta under the accelerated approval pathway under Subpart H, we must conduct at least one post-marketing confirmatory study to verify clinical risk/benefit, which we intend to satisfy through our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, and we may not be able to successfully and timely complete this study or any other post-marketing confirmatory study as required to maintain approval or achieve full approval. Also, the FDA has restricted the indicated use of Oxbryta under the approved label to patients 12 years and older. While we plan to conduct additional studies to potentially lower the indicated age range to 9 months of age, failure to reach agreement with the FDA on these studies, failure to obtain adequate results from them, or disagreements with regulatory authorities over the interpretation of the results may prevent expansion of the age range within our approved label.\nFurthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety or other drug related issues could result in delays or increased costs to assure compliance. With respect to Oxbryta and any other product candidate that is approved, at a minimum, they will each be subject to current standard ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates.\nFor example, the development of Oxbryta for the prophylactic treatment of SCD in pediatric patients is an important part of our current business strategy, and if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for Oxbryta for the desired age ranges or other key labeling parameters, our business is likely to suffer.\nIn addition, manufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. For Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other product candidates we may pursue, we are wholly reliant on third party contract manufacturers for clinical as well as any commercial supplies of product candidates and products. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. We are also required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for Oxbryta and any future products. In addition, we are subject to very rapid reporting obligations relating to any adverse events or serious adverse events relating to Oxbryta and our product candidates. Our failure to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframes could have serious negative consequences for our commercialization, development programs, business and operations. In addition, any promotional communications or materials for prescription drugs are subject to a variety of complex legal and regulatory restrictions, including, but not limited to, consistency with the approved product\u2019s approved label. Failure to obey these standard marketing requirements for Oxbryta or any other approved product, if any, could have serious negative consequences for our commercialization activities, business and operations.\nIf the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with a sponsor\u2019s activities relating to the promotion, marketing, or labeling of a product, these regulatory agencies may impose restrictions or sanctions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, in the United States, a wide range of commercialization and pre-launch\nactivities relating to a drug candidate are subject to potential for significant civil and/or criminal liability and sanctions under federal anti-kickback and fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these complex applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u2022\nissue untitled or warning letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nimpose injunctions;\n\u2022\nimpose fines;\n\u2022\nimpose additional specialized restrictions on the company\u2019s activities and practices;\n\u2022\nsuspend regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nseek voluntary product recalls and impose publicity requirements;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products.\nAs a company, we have limited experience with obtaining approval for, launching or commercializing any product candidates or products, or with complying with most of these complex ongoing regulatory requirements. It will continue to take significant effort and management attention to address compliance with these requirements with respect to Oxbryta in the United States and in any jurisdiction for which we seek to commercialize Oxbryta or any other product candidate, if approved. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity even if significant liabilities do not result. Any failure to comply with these complex ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenues from Oxbryta or to obtain approval for, launch, commercialize and generate revenues from inclacumab or any future product candidates. If we are subject to regulatory sanctions or if regulatory approval for our product candidates is withdrawn or limited, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\nOur business operations and current and future relationships with investigators, health care professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers are or will be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur current and future operations are or will be directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers and third-party payors, subject to various U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our current business operations, including our sales, marketing, distribution, commercialization, medical and educational programs and our clinical research activities, and they may constrain our business and financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain. We may also be subject to additional healthcare, statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by foreign regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims laws, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and analogous state laws and regulations such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and analogous non-U.S.\nfraud and abuse laws and regulations, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental\nthird-party payors.\nEnsuring that our business activities (including our operations and arrangements with third parties) comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is complex, time-consuming, costly and could materially impact our operations. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse, price reporting or other healthcare laws and regulations.\nAlthough an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these requirements, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign privacy, security, and fraud requirements is costly. Any action against us for violation of these requirements, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from our business and operations, and could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform and other factors. Federal and state enforcement bodies in the United States regularly pursue a large number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry, and in the EU, enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, known as GDPR, is increasing. Ensuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion of products or individuals from U.S. government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance\nwith these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to not be in compliance with applicable requirements, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment. If any of the above occur, it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could restrict or regulate post-approval activities, affect our ability to profitably sell Oxbryta and any other drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates. For example, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act or ACA, was passed, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment, there have been many judicial, executive and legislative challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA. The full impact on our business of the ACA, the potential impacts of any challenges, including any laws repealing and/or replacing elements of it, as well as the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation, remain unclear.\nAdditionally, at the federal level, statutes and regulations routinely impact a variety of parameters relating to federal programs and Medicaid. For example, CMS\u2019s final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program, issued in 2016, revised the manner in which the \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The full impact of these federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other new laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may result in additional reductions in Medicaid and other health care funding, or higher production costs which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nThere have been multiple recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and adopted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship\nbetween pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics. In addition, Congress and multiple presidential administrations have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for Oxbryta and our drug candidates, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing over time.\nMoreover, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory changes in recent years aimed at the biopharmaceutical industry. For instance, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label products with a product identifier, and are required keep certain records regarding the product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers\u2019 products are appropriately licensed. Further, manufacturers have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.\nWe expect federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future in the United States may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, increased regulatory burdens and operating costs, decreased net revenue from our pharmaceutical products and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for Oxbryta and any of our drug candidates approved for use. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. These legislative and executive efforts have significantly increased uncertainty regarding the availability of healthcare programs, insurance coverage and reimbursement as a general matter as well as for Oxbryta and our product candidates, and we cannot predict how these events will impact our business or operations. Accordingly, at this time it is difficult to determine the full impact of these efforts on our business. In the United States, many patients with SCD participate in the Medicaid program, and the impact of uncertainty or changes relating to the ACA or healthcare programs, insurance coverage or reimbursement generally have a particularly significant impact on our business or results of operations.\nWe face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may develop therapies that are similar, more advanced, or more effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta and our product candidates.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We are currently aware of various existing therapies and development candidates that are or may compete with Oxbryta and inclacumab for the potential treatment of SCD. For example, the FDA approved Novartis\u2019 crizanlizumab in November 2019. Both crizanlizumab and inclacumab are human monoclonal antibodies against P-selectin\nfor the treatment of VOCs in patients with SCD. The FDA\u2019s approval of crizanlizumab resulted in another new and innovative SCD product entering the United States SCD\nmarket approximately one week earlier than Oxbryta, and substantially earlier than any potential approval of our inclacumab product candidate (which could be a direct competitor to crizanlizumab). As a result, the commercialization of crizanlizumab may also impact our commercialization of Oxbryta in the United States, as well as inclacumab if we are successful in developing and obtaining approval for it for SCD patients. In addition, Novartis announced in October 2020 that the European Commission approved crizanlizumab for the prevention of recurrent VOCs in patients with SCD.\nWe have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection, regulatory approval, product commercialization and market penetration than we do. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render Oxbryta or our product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing any drugs or product candidates against competitors.\nIf the market opportunities for Oxbryta or our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer. Our ability to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share will be necessary for us to achieve profitability and growth.\nOur initial development and commercialization efforts are focused on the potential of Oxbryta to treat SCD. Our projections of both the number of people who have SCD, as well as the subset of people with SCD who have the potential to benefit from treatment with Oxbryta, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of SCD. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potential addressable patient population for Oxbryta and our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with Oxbryta or our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Restrictions on labeling of any approved product, including any restrictions that may be imposed in connection with any approval under Subpart H, may also limit the size of the potential market for Oxbryta and our product candidates. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for Oxbryta or any other drug we may develop or obtain, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability despite obtaining such significant market share.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with only one drug approved for marketing in the United States and with a limited operating history. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have generated limited revenue since our inception, which, together with our limited operating history, may make it difficult for you to assess our future viability.\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with only one drug, Oxbryta, approved for marketing, and such approval is only for the United States. We also have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have focused principally on developing Oxbryta, and our current clinical development activities are focused on Oxbryta and our drug candidates. In August 2018, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with F. Hoffman-LaRoche and Hoffman-La\nRoche Inc., collectively, Roche, for the development and commercialization of inclacumab.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in February 2011 and the commencement of our principal operations in May 2012. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $247.6 million, $266.8 million, and $174.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $986.5 million. We only begun to generate revenues with the December 2019 commercial launch of Oxbryta, and have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses will increase as we:\n\u2022\ncommercialize Oxbryta and continue related clinical development, including conducting (i) our Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study of Oxbryta, (ii) our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, which we intend to serve as our post-confirmatory study of Oxbryta in SCD (and any other post-marketing studies that may be required by regulatory authorities, if any), and (iii) any additional clinical trials of Oxbryta we may conduct now or in the future in SCD patients or for any other indications for Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates, if any;\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain manufacturing and supply relationships with third parties that can provide adequate supplies (in amount and quality) of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates to support commercialization and further clinical development;\n\u2022\nseek and obtain additional regulatory and marketing approvals for Oxbryta for SCD, including for younger pediatric patient populations, or any potential approvals we may pursue;\n\u2022\nmaintain a sales and marketing organization and enter into selected collaborations to commercialize Oxbryta for SCD or any other approved indication, as well as for any other product candidates;\n\u2022\nmaintain a medical affairs organization to advance our engagement with healthcare providers and stakeholders;\n\u2022\nadvance our other programs, including inclacumab and any other product candidates, through nonclinical and clinical development and commence development activities for any additional product candidates we may identify and pursue; and\n\u2022\nexpand our organization to support our commercialization, research, development and medical activities and our operations as a public company.\nPrior to the December 2019 commercial launch of Oxbryta, we had never generated any revenues from product sales, and we may never be able to achieve significant revenues or profitability. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to maintain adequate cash reserves to commercialize Oxbryta, advance our development programs or achieve approval to commercialize any other products, or our failure to achieve sustained profitability, would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, market Oxbryta,\ndiversify our research and development pipeline, market any other product candidates we may identify and pursue (if approved), or continue our operations. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe may require substantial additional funds to achieve our business goals. If we are unable to obtain such funds when needed and on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, limit or terminate our commercialization activities for Oxbryta, our product development efforts or other operations. Raising additional capital may subject us to unfavorable terms, cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to Oxbryta, our product candidates or technologies.\nWe are currently commercializing Oxbryta and investigating Oxbryta in clinical development to support its potential full approval by the FDA and opportunities for potential label expansion. Among other activities, we are evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of Oxbryta in our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, a Phase 2a clinical trial in adolescent and pediatric patients with SCD. Our clinical program for Oxbryta also includes our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, which is our TCD post- confirmatory study of Oxbryta in SCD (to potentially satisfy the FDA\u2019s requirement for a post-confirmatory study under Subpart H). In light of the COVID-19\npandemic, we temporarily delayed or paused our research and development activities, including temporarily pausing screening and enrollment in all GBT-sponsored\nclinical studies (including our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study). Activities on our clinical trials have now resumed, with appropriate measures in place. Assessment of the long-term impact of COVID-19\non our clinical trials is ongoing. In addition, we have initiated and plan to initiate clinical trials on our product candidates, inclacumab and GBT601, and we are conducting nonclinical research activities in other programs.\nDiscovering, developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products is expensive and time-consuming, and we expect our selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to commercialize Oxbryta and engage in research and development efforts for Oxbryta, inclacumab and other product candidates that we may identify and pursue in clinical trials. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had working capital of $553.1 million and $556.5 million, respectively, and capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities totaling $560.9 million and $695.0 million, respectively. We expect that our existing capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Because the outcome of commercialization, reimbursement and any clinical development and regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual capital amounts necessary to successfully commercialize Oxbryta and complete our ongoing and planned additional development of activities for Oxbryta or any other future product candidates.\nOur operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations or license and development agreements. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day\nactivities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates that we may identify and pursue. Moreover, such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other product candidates we may identify and develop in any territories;\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing, selling, and marketing costs associated with the commercialization of Oxbryta and the potential commercialization of inclacumab and any other product candidates we may\nidentify and develop, including the cost and timing of establishing or maintaining our sales and marketing capabilities in any territory(ies);\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of sales and other revenues from Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other product candidates we may identify and develop, including the sales price and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to conduct and complete multiple ongoing studies (including our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study and other studies);\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to conduct and complete any additional clinical studies required to pursue additional regulatory approvals for Oxbryta for SCD, including our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (which is necessary to move from our current Subpart H approval to a full approval) and any studies to support potential label expansions into younger SCD pediatric populations, or any other post-marketing studies for Oxbryta for SCD;\n\u2022\nthe progress, data and results of clinical trials of Oxbryta and product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies, our clinical trials and other related activities, including our ability to enroll subjects in a timely manner for our ongoing and future clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidate that we may identify and develop;\n\u2022\nthe costs of obtaining clinical and commercial supplies of Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other product candidates we may identify and develop;\n\u2022\nour ability to advance our development programs, including for Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other potential product candidate programs we may identify and pursue, the timing and scope of these development activities, and the availability of approval for any of our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain any additional regulatory approvals from any regulatory authorities, and the scope of any such regulatory approvals, to market and sell Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other product candidates we may identify and develop in any territory(ies);\n\u2022\nthe cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we may acquire or in-license\nother product candidates and technologies, and the costs and timing associated with any such acquisitions or in-licenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining, expanding, and protecting our intellectual property portfolio.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit or terminate our development or commercialization activities for Oxbryta, inclacumab or for any other product candidates we may identify and pursue, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are party to a loan and security agreement that contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nIn December 2019, we entered into a loan agreement, or Term Loan, with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors LP, which are BioPharma Credit PLC, as collateral agent, Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master)\nLP, as a lender, and BPCR Limited Partnership, as a lender, for a senior secured credit facility under which we were extended an initial term loan of $75.0 million upon execution of the loan agreement and an additional term loan of $75.0 million in November 2020. Borrowings under the Term Loan are secured by a first priority security interest in and a lien on substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Term Loan restricts our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our business or property, subject to limited exceptions;\n\u2022\nmake certain changes to our organizational structure;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with other entities or acquire other entities;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or create encumbrances on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends, other than dividends paid solely in shares of our common stock, or make distributions on and, in certain cases, repurchase our stock;\n\u2022\nrepay subordinated indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nmake certain investments.\nIn addition, we are required under the Term Loan to comply with various operating covenants and default clauses that may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants or clauses could result in a default under the Term Loan, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively affect our business operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Clinical Development, Regulatory Review and Approval of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to obtain regulatory approval in additional jurisdictions for Oxbryta or one or more jurisdictions for inclacumab or any future product candidates that we may identify and develop, our business will be substantially harmed.\nWe cannot commercialize a product until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is lengthy and unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors. Approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. We have only obtained regulatory approval for Oxbryta in the United States. In January 2021, the EMA accepted for review our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, seeking full marketing authorization of Oxbryta to treat hemolytic anemia in SCD patients ages 12 years and older, and the MAA is undergoing standard review by the EMA. We also plan to submit by mid-2021 a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, to expand the current Oxbryta label to include treatment of SCD in children ages 4 to 11 years, under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval pathway. Thereafter, we also plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a new age-appropriate formulation for this patient population. In addition, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs, which, if granted, will include our MA for Oxbryta, as a result of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU (often referred to as Brexit). We, therefore, plan to utilize the decision reliance procedure available for a period of two years from January 1, 2021, to seek approval of Oxbryta in Great Britain by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, if our MA is granted by the EMA. While utilizing such decision reliance procedure may significantly accelerate the potential regulatory approval of Oxbryta in Great Britain as compared to making a completely separate\napplication in parallel to our EMA MAA, we will still need to make a separate application to the MHRA and there is no guarantee as to if or when the MHRA will approve such application. It is possible that we will never obtain these or any other regulatory approvals for Oxbryta, for inclacumab or for any other product candidates we may seek to develop in the future.\nApplications for product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities (including the EMA) that Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates we may develop are safe and effective for any proposed indications;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our plans or expectations regarding the pathways and endpoints for approval, including the availability of accelerated approval, or the design or implementation of our nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe populations studied in our clinical programs may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety or demonstrate efficacy in the full population for which we seek approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials beyond those we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data and results from our nonclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data and results collected from nonclinical studies or clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other product candidates that we may identify and pursue may not be sufficient to support the submission for regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate\u2019s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find deficiencies with or fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications, or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract and rely on for all clinical and commercial supplies of Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other product candidates (if any); and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change in a manner that renders our development or manufacturing efforts insufficient for approval.\nThe lengthy regulatory review and approval process, as well as the inherent unpredictability of the results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and our reliance on third-party manufacturers for any product candidates, may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market Oxbryta outside of the United States or to market inclacumab or other product candidates that we may pursue in the United States or elsewhere, which would significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nExpedited development and regulatory approval programs for Oxbryta, such as the accelerated approval under Subpart H, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, may not lead to any approval, and may lead to an approval that is later withdrawn.\nThe FDA approved Oxbryta through the accelerated approval process under Subpart H, and we plan to seek approval under the accelerated approval process under Subpart H for a sNDA to expand the current Oxbryta label to include treatment of SCD in children ages 4 to 11 years. While the FDA approved Oxbryta under Subpart H, we cannot be assured that our planned sNDA will benefit from or receive accelerated approval under Subpart H, or that any other product candidates that we may develop will qualify for or benefit from any such expedited programs in the United States, including under Subpart H, or in any foreign regulatory jurisdictions.\nIn June 2017, the EMA granted PRIME designation for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD. The PRIME program is a regulatory mechanism that provides for early and proactive EMA support to medicine developers to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new products that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need. We cannot be assured that Oxbryta or any other product candidates that we may develop will benefit from a PRIME program designation.\nThe FDA grants accelerated approval under Subpart H for new drugs that address serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. Under Subpart H, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity.\nDrugs approved under Subpart H are required to be further evaluated in at least one post-marketing study to verify clinical benefit. To satisfy such requirement, we are conducting our TCD post-confirmatory study, the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. We previously announced that the FDA agreed that TCD flow velocity would be an acceptable primary endpoint in a post-approval confirmatory study of Oxbryta to demonstrate stroke risk reduction for purposes of full approval by the FDA and that we had reached final agreement with the FDA on the design of the TCD post-confirmatory study.\nWe temporarily paused screening and enrollment on our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study due to the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. Activities on our clinical trials have now resumed, with appropriate measures in place. Assessment of the long-term impact of COVID-19\non our clinical trials is ongoing and we may not be able to complete this study or any other successful post-marketing confirmatory study as required to maintain approval and achieve full approval, or data and results from our required post-marketing confirmatory program may not verify Oxbryta\u2019s clinical benefit to maintain approval and achieve full approval, in which case the product may be required to be withdrawn from market approval.\nAccess to any expedited program, including through the FDA (such as accelerated approval under Subpart H), may be withdrawn by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority if it believes that the program is no longer supported by data from our clinical development, and accelerated approval under Subpart H may be withdrawn if, among other reasons, required post-marketing confirmatory studies are not completed or if the FDA determines the results of post-marketing confirmatory studies do not verify clinical benefit.\nAll of our programs other than Oxbryta are still in earlier development stages, so we remain very reliant on the potential success of Oxbryta in the clinic and in the marketplace. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Oxbryta for SCD or complete clinical development of Oxbryta, or experience delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nTo date, we have invested a majority of our efforts and financial resources in the nonclinical and clinical development of Oxbryta, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, submitting and obtaining approval for an NDA, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. Our other clinical product candidates are in the earlier stages of development, and our only clinical development program for Oxbryta is in SCD. Our future success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully continue to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval for, and commercialize Oxbryta inside and outside the United States for SCD.\nWe are evaluating Oxbryta in SCD patients in our ongoing HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (which is our post-approval confirmatory study), and other ongoing and planned clinical trials. In light of the COVID-19\npandemic, we temporarily delayed certain of our research and development activities, including temporarily pausing screening and enrollment in all GBT-sponsored\nclinical studies. Activities on our clinical trials have now resumed, with appropriate measures in place. Assessment of the long-term impact of COVID-19\non our clinical trials is ongoing.\nAll of our other programs are in earlier stages of research and development. As a result, even after in-licensing\nthe inclacumab program, we are very dependent on Oxbryta for our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also very dependent on the data and results that we obtain over time from our clinical program for Oxbryta, including the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. The primary endpoint of the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study relates to TCD measurement, and we have not previously conducted any Phase 3 clinical study of Oxbryta in SCD patients using this primary endpoint, nor do we believe this measure has been used as a primary endpoint for any registrational studies for any other SCD therapies.\nAs we continue our clinical development of Oxbryta, the additional data we generate could be different from, including less favorable in terms of efficacy and/or safety, than the data generated and discussed with the FDA to date. If this were to occur, it could significantly impact our continued development and commercialization of Oxbryta. In addition, depending on the results we obtain from our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, which we intend to satisfy our post-approval confirmatory requirement under Subpart H, accelerated approval of Oxbryta under Subpart H may be withdrawn (which would also mean full approval would not be achieved, and could also mean that Oxbryta could be required to be removed from the market) if the required post-marketing confirmatory program is not completed or if the FDA determines the results do not verify clinical risk/benefit. If our planned submission of a sNDA to expand the current Oxbryta label to include treatment of SCD in children ages 4 to 11 years is approved and our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study also serves as the post-approval confirmatory study under Subpart H for any such pediatric approval, any accelerated approval of Oxbryta in this pediatric population, if any, may be withdrawn as well depending on the results we obtain from the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. We do not have a special protocol assessment agreement in place with the FDA for our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study.\nWe cannot be certain that Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates that we seek to develop will be successful in nonclinical studies or clinical trials or receive and maintain any regulatory approvals. If we do not receive regulatory approval for, regulatory approval is withdrawn from, or we otherwise fail to successfully commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates, we are likely to need to spend significant additional time and resources to identify other product candidates, advance them through nonclinical and clinical development and apply for regulatory approvals, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe development of Oxbryta as a potential disease-modifying anti-sickling agent in SCD patients represents a novel therapeutic approach, and there is a risk that the outcomes of our clinical trials will not be favorable or otherwise support any further decision to seek or grant or maintain any regulatory approval.\nWe have concentrated our product research and development efforts on developing novel, mechanism-based therapeutics for the treatment of grievous blood-based disorders with significant unmet need, and our future success depends on the success of this therapeutic approach. The clinical trial requirements of the FDA and other comparable regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of any product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential product. To date, there are only four approved therapies for SCD, Oxbryta, crizanlizumab, hydroxyurea, and L-glutamine,\nand Oxbryta is the first approved therapy directed toward preventing the polymerization of hemoglobin molecules as a mechanism to reduce red blood cell sickling in SCD patients. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for a therapeutic product candidate such as Oxbryta that targets this mechanism in SCD patients are subject to unknown risks, and we may experience setbacks with our ongoing or planned clinical trials of Oxbryta in SCD because of the limited clinical experience with its mechanism of action in these patients.\nIn particular, regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe have not issued definitive guidance as to how to measure and achieve efficacy in treatments for SCD. Based on our discussions with the FDA regarding\nthe design for the HOPE Study, we determined to measure change in hemoglobin levels as the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 HOPE Study. This primary endpoint has not been used previously in a registration study for any SCD treatment. As a result, regulators outside of the United States have not determined that such data would signify a clinically meaningful result in SCD patients or would support seeking or obtaining regulatory approval.\nWe did not achieve statistically significant results with respect to either potential key secondary endpoint in Part A of the HOPE Study (relating to episodes of VOCs and to the Patient Reported Outcome instrument developed by us), and we may not achieve key endpoints in other clinical trials, such as any post-marketing confirmatory studies. In addition, we may not achieve the same results with respect to the primary endpoint in Part A of the HOPE Study in other ongoing of future clinical trials, including our ongoing TCD post-confirmatory study, the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. Any inability to design clinical trials with protocols and endpoints acceptable to applicable regulatory authorities, and to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for Oxbryta, inclacumab and any other product candidates that we may pursue, would have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, and initial studies may not establish or maintain an adequate safety or efficacy profile for Oxbryta, inclacumab or other product candidates that we may pursue to justify proceeding to advanced clinical trials or an application for regulatory approval.\nThe results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab and of any future product candidates that we may pursue may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial may not necessarily predict final results. For example, our nonclinical studies and clinical trials to date of Oxbryta in SCD have involved mostly one genotype of SCD, known as HbSS, and the results of these studies may not be replicated in other genotypes of SCD in clinical trials or in the general patient population. In addition, the results obtained in our development program for SCD patients aged 12 years and older, such as in our Phase 3 HOPE Study, may not be replicated in our ongoing studies in pediatric populations, including our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study and HOPE-KIDS 2 Study.\nProducts evaluated in post-marketing studies and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Since Oxbryta was approved under Subpart H requiring successful completion of a confirmatory clinical trial to obtain full FDA approval, if the results of our confirmatory study fail to demonstrate efficacy and safety adequate to obtain full regulatory approval for Oxbryta and maintain its marketing approval in the United States, this would have a substantial impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval, in part because of differing interpretations of data and results by regulatory authorities. For example, our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study and our ActIVe Phase 4 study designed to evaluate the effect of Oxbryta on exercise capacity, as measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients 12 years of age and older with SCD, utilize an \u201copen-label\u201d trial design, and we may use open-label trial designs in the future. An open-label clinical trial is one in which both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo. In many cases, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels, as in the case of our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to \u201cpatient bias,\u201d where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving the treatment under investigation, or \u201cinvestigator bias,\u201d where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of the treatment administered to patients and may interpret\nthe information of a treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with Oxbryta or any of our product candidates when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control. In addition, data and results from later studies or programs may conflict with earlier findings for a variety of other reasons.\nOur failure to demonstrate the required characteristics to support continued marketing of Oxbryta in the United States, full FDA approval, marketing approval for Oxbryta outside of the United States, or marketing approval for inclacumab or any other product candidate we may choose to develop, in any ongoing or future clinical trials would substantially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nBefore we are able to obtain any marketing approval for Oxbryta outside of the United States, foreign regulatory authorities may impose additional requirements, the scope of which are not fully known at this time.\nBefore we can obtain any marketing approval for a drug candidate for any potential indication, we must successfully complete clinical trials. The FDA typically requires at least two pivotal, well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials as a condition to the submission of an NDA and does not usually consider a single Phase 3 clinical trial to be adequate to support product approval. The FDA will typically only consider relying on one pivotal trial if, in addition, other well-controlled studies of the drug exist (for example, for other dosage forms or in other populations) or if the pivotal trial is a multi-center trial that provides highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of an important clinical benefit, and a confirmatory study would have been difficult to conduct on ethical grounds.\nThe FDA approved Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD under the accelerated approval pathway under Subpart H, and approval under this accelerated pathway means that we are required to conduct at least one post-marketing confirmatory study sufficient to verify Oxbryta\u2019s clinical benefit, which we intend to satisfy through our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. With respect to Europe, the EMA accepted for review our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, seeking full marketing authorization of Oxbryta to treat hemolytic anemia in SCD patients ages 12 years and older. The MAA is undergoing standard review by the EMA, and it includes data from our Phase 3 HOPE Study and our Phase 2 HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, both of which enrolled patients at clinical sites in Europe.\nForeign authorities may not consider the results of our ongoing, planned or potential future clinical trials of Oxbryta to be sufficient to obtain or maintain any regulatory and/or pricing or reimbursement approvals outside of the United States. For example, in the EU the EMA may not approve the MAA we have submitted which is under standard review for the potential approval of Oxbryta to treat hemolytic anemia in SCD patients ages 12 years and older. Any post-marketing confirmatory studies, if required, would result in increased costs and potential delays in the clinical development and marketing approval process outside the United States, which may require us to expend more resources than are available to us. In addition, it is possible that the FDA and the comparable foreign authorities may have divergent opinions on the elements necessary for a successful NDA or other application for marketing authorization, as applicable, which may cause us to alter our development, regulatory and/or commercialization strategies.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in conducting or completing our clinical trials, which in turn will result in additional costs and may ultimately prevent successful or timely completion of the clinical development and commercialization of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates we may identify and pursue.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. In addition, because the FDA approved Oxbryta under the accelerated approval pathway under Subpart H, we must conduct at least one post-marketing confirmatory study to verify clinical risk/benefit, which we intend to satisfy through our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain\nas to outcome, and we cannot guarantee that any of our current or future clinical trials for Oxbryta or any other product candidates we may pursue will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. For example, in light of the COVID-19\npandemic, we temporarily paused all site activation, screening and enrollment activities for our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (other than, where feasible, contracting and other administrative study start-up\nactivities). Activities on our clinical trials have now resumed, with measures in place that we believe are appropriate. Assessment of the long-term impact of COVID-19\non our clinical trials is ongoing, and it is unknown whether we will be required to pause or delay such activities again in the future. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design, including clinical endpoints sufficient to support an approval decision;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures to receive approval for conduct of clinical studies in one or more geographies, which could result in delays in enrollment and availability of data and results;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with a sufficient number of prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee approval for each clinical trial site;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting a sufficient number of suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold by any regulatory authority, including if imposed due to safety concerns after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or study sites;\n\u2022\nfailure by our CROs, clinical sites, participating clinicians or patients, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical trial, regulatory or legal requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practices, or GCPs, or applicable regulatory requirements in other countries;\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of sufficient quantities of Oxbryta or our product candidates or study related devices to the clinical sites and patients;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients enroll or complete participation in a study in accordance with applicable protocols or protocol amendments or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nreduction in the number of participating clinical trial sites or patients, including by dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\nfailure to address in an adequate or timely manner any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or increases in costs of clinical trials of Oxbryta or our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of serious adverse events or other safety concerns associated with Oxbryta or our product candidates; or\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols or obtaining additional IRB or other approvals to conduct or complete clinical studies of Oxbryta or our product candidates.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated for any reason (which could occur as a result of termination by us, by the IRBs or ethics committees of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board for such trial, or by the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities). A clinical trial can be suspended or terminated for a wide variety of reasons, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by us, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, or failure to demonstrate a benefit from using Oxbryta or a drug candidate. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to Oxbryta or our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge the development program from the data and results for the previous version to the modified version.\nClinical trial delays could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize a drug or product candidate or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta and our product candidates. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our drug development and approval process or jeopardize our ability to maintain our current FDA approval of Oxbryta (or to achieve full FDA approval or any product approvals outside of the United States), and jeopardize our ability to continue or commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficulty in enrolling patients or maintaining compliance with dosing or other requirements in our clinical trials could delay or prevent clinical trials of Oxbryta or our product candidates, which in turn could delay or prevent our ability to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize Oxbryta and our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in our ongoing and planned clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab, and any other product candidates that we may develop are critical to our success. Our clinical development efforts are initially focused on rare chronic blood diseases. For example, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of SCD, for which Oxbryta is indicated, is approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. Accordingly, there are limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials in our target indications. We may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of subjects to complete our clinical trials of Oxbryta because of the perceived risks and benefits of Oxbryta, the availability of competing therapies and clinical trials, the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective subjects and the subject referral practices of physicians, among other factors.\nFurther, if subjects in our clinical trials fail to comply with our dosing regimens or other requirements in our clinical trials, we may not be able to generate clinical data acceptable to the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in our trials. For example, successful conduct of our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (our post-approval confirmatory study) will require consistency in TCD measurements, which is why we are providing specific training and equipment to participating clinical trial sites in such clinical trial. Failure to achieve consistent high-quality readings could result in data that are difficult to interpret or that delay or confound the results. If clinical sites or patients are unwilling or unable to participate in, complete or comply with the protocols for our studies for any reason, the timeline for recruiting subjects, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed.\nIf we experience difficulties or delays in enrollment or are otherwise unable to successfully complete any clinical trial of Oxbryta, or any other product candidates we may pursue, our costs are likely to increase, and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval (or achieve full regulatory approval of Oxbryta) and generate product revenue from Oxbryta and any of these product candidates will be impaired. Any of these occurrences would harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of Oxbryta or our product candidates, we may need to delay, limit or terminate our clinical development activities.\nClinical trials by their nature utilize only a small sample of the potential patient population. For example, our Phase 3 HOPE Study in SCD patients represents only a very small fraction of all patients with SCD. Side\neffects of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates that we may develop may be uncovered only in later stages of clinical trials, or only in trials involving different patient populations (such as pediatric patients), or only during post-approval studies, such as our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (our TCD confirmatory study), or the safety reporting required for approved products. Many approved drugs and product candidates that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Moreover, a nonclinical toxicology study with Oxbryta in non-humans\nand clinical trials involving other hemoglobin modifiers (other than Oxbryta) have shown a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissue when a significant percentage of hemoglobin is modified. Hemoglobin modifiers, by increasing HbS\u2019s affinity for oxygen, can cause a shift in oxygen levels, potentially resulting in tissue hypoxia. To date, clinical studies of Oxbryta have not shown evidence of tissue hypoxia. However, if Oxbryta or any other product candidates that we may develop are associated with tissue hypoxia or any other undesirable side effects or unexpected undesirable characteristics in clinical trials or nonclinical studies, we may need to abandon their development or limit their development to more narrow uses or subpopulations, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, with respect to Oxbryta, such a result may also significantly impact or require us to terminate our commercialization of Oxbryta.\nAlthough the FDA and the European Commission have each granted orphan drug designation for Oxbryta for the potential treatment of SCD, we may not receive orphan drug designation for inclacumab or any other product candidates for which we may submit new applications for orphan drug designation, and any orphan drug designations that we have received or may receive in the future may not confer marketing exclusivity or other expected commercial benefits.\nOur business strategy focuses on the development of product candidates for the treatment of rare, chronic blood disorders that may be eligible for FDA or EU orphan drug designation. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the EU, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. In the EU, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA recommends orphan drug designation to promote the development of medical products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment is authorized (or in other very limited circumstances). In 2015 and 2016, respectively, the FDA and the European Commission (acting on a positive recommendation by the EMA) each granted orphan drug designation for Oxbryta for the treatment of patients with SCD.\nGenerally, if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and 10 years in the EU. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nAlthough the FDA and the EMA have each granted orphan drug designation to Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD, we may apply for orphan drug designation for Oxbryta in other jurisdictions or for other indications, or for inclacumab or other product candidates we may develop and pursue in the future. Applicable regulatory authorities may not grant us these additional designations. In addition, the exclusivity granted under any orphan drug designations that we have received from the FDA and the EMA, or may receive from any other regulatory authorities (if any), may not effectively protect Oxbryta or any other product candidate we pursue from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. For example, in the United States,\neven after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior, or the FDA can approve a competitor application for the same drug for a different indication than the orphan drug designation. In addition, legislators or regulators may reevaluate and elect to modify orphan drug exclusivity laws or regulations in ways that could materially impact existing or future orphan drug designations. We do not know if, when, or how such authorities may change their orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes may affect our business. Any inability to secure or maintain orphan drug designation or the exclusivity benefits of this designation would have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, even if any orphan drug designations we receive are maintained, we may be unable to realize significant commercial benefits from these regulatory exclusivities for Oxbryta or any other product candidate we pursue.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely, and will continue to rely, on third parties to conduct some of our nonclinical studies and all of our clinical trials and also to perform other tasks for us. If these third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs, including our CROs for our clinical trials of Oxbryta, to monitor and manage data for some of our ongoing nonclinical studies and for all of our clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of these nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with all applicable cGMPs, GCPs, and current good laboratory practices, or GLPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of study sponsors, principal investigators, study sites, manufacturing facilities, nonclinical testing facilities and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or other vendors fail to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our nonclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the applicable regulatory authorities may suspend regulatory approval or require us to repeat or to perform additional nonclinical and clinical studies before approving our marketing applications, which would delay the regulatory review and approval process, perhaps significantly.\nIn addition, the execution of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data and results produced, and the supply of product for our trials and commercialization, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. These third parties may terminate their agreements with us upon short notice for our uncured material breach, or under certain other circumstances. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs or other key vendors (including manufacturing and testing facilities) terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or other key vendors on a timely basis or at all, or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs and other key vendors are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with them, we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our programs. Furthermore, these third party CROs or other key vendors may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If CROs or other key vendors do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data and results they obtain or the product they supply is compromised for any reason (including failure to adhere to our protocols, or regulatory requirements), our development activities may be extended, delayed, or terminated and we may not be able to seek, obtain or maintain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize Oxbryta or any of our product candidates. Switching or adding CROs or any other key vendors involves additional cost, time and\nmanagement resources and focus. In addition, our CROs or other key vendors may also generate higher costs than anticipated.\nIn addition, in connection with any NDA or MMA for our product candidates, pre-approval\ninspections by a regulatory agency of our facilities and/or those of third parties involved in the drug development program may occur, including at clinical trial sites, CMOs or other third parties on which we are very reliant. Significant negative results from pre-approval\ninspections, if any, could materially delay potential approval of the drug candidate. Accordingly, our dependence on third-party CROs, other key vendors and other third parties may subject us to challenges, delays and costs that have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely entirely on third parties for the manufacturing of Oxbryta, inclacumab and for any other product candidates we may pursue for nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and we expect to continue to do so for the commercialization of Oxbryta in the United States and for any other product commercialization we may conduct. Our business could be harmed if any of those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product, or fail to do so at acceptable quality or quantity levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture drug supplies for our ongoing commercialization of Oxbryta and for any clinical trials we are conducting or may conduct for Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other future product candidates, and we do not presently expect that we will establish or acquire the resources necessary to manufacture any of our product candidates on a commercial scale. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, wholly on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture or any required post-marketing studies of Oxbryta, and we expect to do the same with respect to any other product candidates, if any, that receives marketing approval. If any manufacturer with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which do not currently have or anticipate developing the requisite capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with one or more different manufacturers, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms and timelines, if at all. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the trial, any significant delay or discontinuity in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay the clinical development and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could harm our business and results of operations. We expect to rely on multiple third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of Oxbryta as well as for inclacumab or any other product candidates, if approved.\nWe may be unable to establish or maintain any agreements with third-party manufacturers for Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates, or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish or maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach or termination of the manufacturing agreement by the third party or by us, including at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nthe inability of the third party to satisfy our ordering requirements as to quality, quantity and/or price, including, without limitation, potential impact on supply chain due to the impact of public health risks, such as the COVID-19\npandemic;\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\nand\n\u2022\nthe unwillingness of the third party to extend or renew terms with us when desired.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers in connection with inclacumab entails additional potential risks, in connection with the transfer of technology from Roche to our third-party manufacturer for inclacumab, and the\nrequirement for approval by the FDA of any Investigational New Drug application, or IND, from the new site, which may not be successful. In addition, because of our lack of experience manufacturing a biologic product, we will have greater reliance on the expertise and experience of our third-party manufacturer for inclacumab.\nFurthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory and market risks for the production of such third-party materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may affect the regulatory assessment or clearance of our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities generally, and industry consolidation, pricing or other market factors may cause our contract manufacturers to scale back, terminate or refuse to renew desired arrangements for our materials. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to commercialize Oxbryta or develop, obtain additional regulatory approval for or further market, as applicable, Oxbryta or our product candidates, if approved.\nOxbryta, inclacumab and any future product candidates that we may identify and pursue may compete with other product candidates and marketed drugs for access to manufacturing facilities. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay or impair clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization. Although we believe we have adequate supplies to commercialize Oxbryta and conduct our ongoing clinical trials, if we are unable to enter into relationships with additional contract manufacturers, or our current or future contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may experience delays and incur additional costs in our continued commercialization and clinical development activities. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacturing of Oxbryta, our product candidates and any other marketed drugs may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize Oxbryta or any other product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nIf the contract manufacturing facilities on which we rely do not continue to meet regulatory requirements or are unable to meet our supply demands, our business will be harmed.\nAll entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing contract manufacturers for Oxbryta and for our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including recordkeeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of contaminants or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of Oxbryta or our product candidates. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, suspension of production, seizures or voluntary recalls of product candidates or marketed drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect clinical or commercial supplies of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any of our future product candidates.\nAmong other requirements, we or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of an NDA or MAA seeking approval of a product candidate on a timely basis and must adhere to GLP and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies through their facilities inspection programs. The facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval\ninspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval for Oxbryta. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any of our future product candidates or the associated quality systems. Although we oversee the contract manufacturers, we cannot control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with these complex regulatory requirements. If these manufacturers, facilities, records or systems do not pass pre-approval\ninspections and reviews, additional regulatory approval of Oxbryta or regulatory approval of inclacumab or any of our other future product candidates may never be granted or may be substantially delayed.\nIn addition, at any time following approval of a product for sale, the regulatory authorities also may audit the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that could be costly or time consuming for us or a third party to implement, and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical study or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\nAdditionally, if supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted, an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a supplement to an NDA, MAA variation or equivalent foreign regulatory filing, which would result in further delay, uncertainty and costs. If this occurs, our commercial distribution or clinical trials could be delayed significantly as we establish alternative supply sources. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our products or product candidates may be proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have contractual restrictions or other challenges in seeking to transfer such skills to a back-up\nor alternate supplier. In addition to verifying that any new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations, we would also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product or product candidate according to the specifications previously submitted to or approved by the FDA or another regulatory authority. The delays and costs associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner or within budget. In addition, changes in manufacturers often involve changes in manufacturing procedures and processes, which, in the case of the manufacturers that supply our product candidates, could require that we conduct bridging studies between our prior clinical supply used in our clinical trials and that of any new manufacturer. We may be unsuccessful in demonstrating the comparability of clinical supplies, which could require the conduct of additional clinical trials and result in the suspension of or delays in our commercialization activities and clinical development plans. Any of these factors could cause us to incur higher costs and could cause the delay or termination of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals, or commercialization of Oxbryta or our product candidates. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets and confidential information, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our critical information will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to manufacture Oxbryta and to conduct other aspects of our clinical development activities, as well as for inclacumab and any other product candidates we may pursue, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, other forms of agreement with any collaborators, CROs, manufacturers and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets and confidential information may become known by our competitors, may inadvertently be incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how\nand trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or confidential information, or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur agreements typically restrict the ability of certain collaborators, CROs, manufacturers, other key vendors and consultants to publish data, although many of our contracts provide for the right to publish data in specified circumstances. A significant breach of these publication provisions could impair our competitive position. In addition, we conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets and other confidential information. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and confidential information, our competitors may discover them, either through breach of agreements relating to these programs, independent development or publication of information where we do not have proprietary or otherwise protected rights at the time of publication. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or confidential information would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for Oxbryta or our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize product candidates similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab and other product candidates that we may pursue may be impaired. Changes in patent policy and rules could impair our ability to protect our products and increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection of the intellectual property, particularly patents, that we may exclusively license or own solely and jointly with others in the United States and other countries with respect to Oxbryta and our product candidates and technology, including inclacumab. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to Oxbryta and our product candidates.\nObtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming, uncertain and complex, and we or our licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications, or maintain, enforce and license any patents that may issue from such patent applications, at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaboration partners fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors, licensees or collaboration partners are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal, technological and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or vice versa. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to Oxbryta or our product candidates. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are and will remain highly uncertain. The patent examination process may require us or our licensors, licensees or collaboration partners to narrow the scope of the claims of our or our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 pending and future patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect Oxbryta, inclacumab or any future product candidates, in\nwhole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive product candidates. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative product candidates in a non-infringing\nmanner, or by successfully seeking to narrow or invalidate our patents or render them unenforceable. Our and our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology.\nWe cannot assure you that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. If such prior art exists, it can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes\nreview, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize Oxbryta or our product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab or any future product candidates.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical product candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of Oxbryta or our product candidates. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nThe United States has enacted patent reform legislation from time to time and the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our patent protection, or weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States prior to March 15, 2013, the first to make the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first-to-file\na patent application is entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or AIA, enacted in 2011, the United States has moved to a first-to-file\nsystem similar to other countries\u2019 systems. The AIA also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, and may also affect patent litigation. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO must still implement various regulations, the courts have yet to address certain of these provisions and the applicability of the AIA and new regulations remain to be issued. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. However, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of patents that may issue from such patent applications, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial condition. Any further changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our potential patent protection.\nOur products and product candidates may be eligible for other forms of exclusivity (e.g., data exclusivity) for varying periods in varying jurisdictions. For example, we expect inclacumab, if approved, would be eligible for regulatory exclusivity (e.g., data exclusivity for biologics and orphan drug exclusivity) in various jurisdictions such as the U.S. and Europe, which exclusivities may extend beyond patent expiry in the case of inclacumab. Both the United States and the EU provide pathways for biologics competitors to seek approval for biosimilar products at the end of the relevant exclusivity period or, in some circumstances, before such period expires (for example, if a biosimilar applicant obtains approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications). As a result, the available forms of exclusivity may not provide us with sufficient protections to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become subject to claims alleging infringement of third parties\u2019 patents or proprietary rights and/or claims seeking to invalidate our patents, which would be costly, time consuming and, if successfully asserted against us, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any future product candidates that we may develop.\nWe cannot assure that Oxbryta, inclacumab or any future product candidates that we may develop will not infringe existing or future third-party patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that we may infringe by commercializing Oxbryta or any future product candidates that we may develop. We may additionally be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of Oxbryta, inclacumab or any of our other product candidates.\nWe may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation against us regarding third party intellectual property rights with respect to Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other of our future product candidates, that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to be willfully infringing a third party\u2019s patents. We may also be required to indemnify parties with whom we have contractual relationships against such claims. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing Oxbryta and our product candidates and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both, that could be significant. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to redesign it, or to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, such litigation can be expensive, uncertain, and time consuming to litigate, and would divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business significantly.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology similar or identical to ours, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine which party is entitled to a patent on the disputed invention. We may also become involved in similar opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office or similar offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to Oxbryta and our product candidates and technology.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors or other parties may infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation, if we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering Oxbryta or one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering Oxbryta or our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In addition, there is an abbreviated regulatory pathway, under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, for the regulatory approval of biosimilar or interchangeable biologic products, which could create a litigation pathway for a third party to challenge patents covering inclacumab. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are multiple potential grounds for a validity challenge or an unenforceability assertion. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is often highly unpredictable.\nInterference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn addition, our defense of litigation, interference or derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations including our ability to commercialize Oxbryta, raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring Oxbryta and our product candidates to domestic and foreign markets.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe may become subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor.\nFor example, inventorship disputes may arise from conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product candidates or as a result of questions regarding co-ownership\nof potential joint inventions. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership or we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations including our ability to raise the funds necessary to commercialize Oxbryta, continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe jointly own patents and patent applications with third parties. Our ability to exploit or enforce these patent rights, or to prevent the third party from granting licenses to others with respect to these patent rights, may be limited in some circumstances.\nWe jointly own certain patents and patent applications with third parties. In the absence of an agreement with each co-owner\nof jointly owned patent rights, we will be subject to default rules pertaining to joint ownership. Some countries require the consent of all joint owners to exploit, license or assign jointly owned patents, and if we are unable to obtain that consent from the joint owners, we may be unable to exploit the invention or to license or assign our rights under these patents and patent applications in those countries. For example, we have exclusively licensed from the Regents of the University of California, or Regents, worldwide patent rights covering Oxbryta and certain Oxbryta analogs, some of which patent rights we jointly own with the Regents. Additionally, in the United States, each co-owner\nmay be required to be joined as a party to any claim or action we may wish to bring to enforce these patent rights, which may limit our ability to pursue third party infringement claims.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how\nof others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or other confidential information, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nWe seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. For example, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets or confidential know-how\nis expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret.\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets or confidential know-how\ntrade protection could adversely affect our competitive position. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, our competitors could limit our use of our trade secrets or confidential know-how.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance\nwith these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We employ outside firms and rely on them to pay many of these fees. The USPTO and various non- U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of complex procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, non-compliance\ncan result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, with a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries worldwide, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but patent enforcement is not strong. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights throughout the world. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological complexity and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the AIA has been recently enacted in the United States, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. patent system.\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d\nsystem for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications\nare filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could, therefore, be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application, but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and provide opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nThe USPTO recently has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA, and, in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and it is not clear what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 issued patents, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this has also contributed to uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws has also increased in recent years. In addition, the European patent system is relatively stringent in the type of amendments that are allowed during prosecution. These changes could limit our ability to obtain new patents in the future that may be important for our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nPandemics such as the one caused by the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,\nwhich causes COVID-19,\nas well as similar outbreaks and other public health crises, could adversely impact our business, including our commercialization activities, clinical trials and preclinical studies.\nPandemics, similar outbreaks and other public health crises could adversely impact our business. For example, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,\nwhich causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),\nhas evolved into a global pandemic that has significantly impacted people and entities throughout the world. As a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions that could materially impact our business. The extent to which this pandemic or other health crises, or changes in laws and regulations such as shelter-in-place\norders, impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19\nand the actions taken to contain COVID-19\nor treat its impact, among others.\nAs a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, various aspects of our business operations have been, and could continue to be, disrupted. In response to the pandemic, we implemented a work from home policy, with our administrative and certain other employees continuing their work outside of our offices, and restricted on-site\nstaff to only a limited number of employees who have critical needs to be in the facility. The increase in working remotely could increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local and federal regulators, ethics committees, manufacturing sites and clinical trial sites. In addition, as a result of shelter-in-place\norders or other mandated travel restrictions, staff conducting on-site\nresearch and development may have limited access to our laboratory space, and these core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19\npandemic has also reduced the ability to engage with the medical and investor communities, including due to the cancellation or reformatting of conferences scheduled throughout the year. For example, in light of the COVID-19\npandemic, we temporarily suspended our field team from most in-person\ninteractions, including visits to physician offices, clinics and hospitals as well as in-person\nmeetings with payors. These and other measures may significantly impact our ability to commercialize Oxbryta, such as by impacting new patient enrollments.\nIn addition, our ongoing and planned clinical trials have been and will likely continue to be affected by the COVID-19\npandemic. For example, in light of the COVID-19\npandemic, we temporarily paused screening and enrollment in all GBT-sponsored\nclinical studies (other than, where feasible, certain contracting and other administrative study start-up\nactivities). Activities on our clinical trials have now resumed, with measures in place that we believe are appropriate. Assessment of the long-term impact of COVID-19\non our clinical trials is ongoing, and it is unknown whether we will be required to pause or delay such activities again in the future. Any prolongation or de-prioritization\nof our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of Oxbryta or our product candidates. Study procedures (particularly any procedures that may be deemed non-essential),\nsite initiation, participant recruitment and enrollment, participant dosing, shipment of our study compound, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring, site inspections and data analysis may be delayed or paused due to changes in hospital or research institution policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital and other medical resources toward pandemic efforts, or other reasons related to the pandemic. If COVID-19\ncontinues to spread, some participants and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols and we may experience increased patient study withdrawals or protocol deviations. For example, this may occur if quarantines or other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) may impede participant movement, affect access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services for a prolonged period of time. As a result, we may be unable to conduct our clinical trials.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19\npandemic has resulted in, and could continue to cause, interruptions or delays in the operations of the FDA and other domestic or foreign regulatory agencies, which could impact the conduct of our clinical trials, the ability to seek agency input on our regulatory strategies and potential filings or interactions with regulatory agencies that oversee our research, development and promotional activities. For example, the COVID-19\npandemic has led the FDA to place some foreign and domestic inspections on hold. Should the FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval of a marketing application and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter. Additionally, if there is inadequate information to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility, FDA may defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19\npandemic and may also experience delays in their regulatory activities. The extent and impact of such any such disruptions or delays are currently unpredictable.\nOur and our vendors\u2019 and collaborators\u2019 research, preclinical development, and manufacturing operations also may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic. We currently utilize third parties to, among other\nthings, supply and manufacture raw materials, components, and Oxbryta and our product candidates, to ship Oxbryta and our product candidates and manufacturing materials, and to perform certain testing relating to Oxbryta and our product candidates, including clinical studies and stability testing. If we, or any third parties in our supply chain for materials which are used in either the manufacture of Oxbryta or our product candidates or the conduct of our research and development, are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, our supply chain may be disrupted and our ability to manufacture and ship Oxbryta and our product candidates for commercial and research and development activities may be limited. In particular, the FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorization to certain vaccines for COVID-19,\nand more are likely to be authorized in the future. The resultant demand for vaccines and potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or equivalent foreign legislation, may make it more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing slots for the supply needed to support the commercialization of Oxbryta or the development of our product candidates.\nIn addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through equity or debt financings, or such financing transactions may be on unfavorable terms. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. Furthermore, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19\ncould materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our commercialization activities, our clinical and preclinical programs, our clinical, preclinical, research, manufacturing, and regulatory activities, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material adverse impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the management, commercial, research and development, clinical, financial and business development expertise of our executive officers, as well as the other members of our team. Although we have employment offer letters with each of our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, medical, clinical, technical operations personnel and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates. Competition to hire qualified personnel in our industry and geographic market is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. The COVID-19\npandemic, as well as similar outbreaks or other significant business disruptions, may make such efforts more challenging. Furthermore, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist\nus in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nWe have recently implemented sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and expect to expand our product development capabilities, and, as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWith our recent establishment of infrastructure required for commercialization of Oxbryta and our current and planned product development activities, we have experienced significant and rapid growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of sales, marketing and distribution, regulatory affairs, research and drug development. To manage this and future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage our recent or future growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing, acquiring or commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives could be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued commercialization, clinical testing and seeking of additional regulatory approval of Oxbryta, a key element of our strategy is to pursue, develop and commercialize a portfolio of products utilizing proprietary discovery and development technology. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and may also selectively pursue commercially synergistic in-licensing\nor acquisition of additional assets, such as inclacumab. With the exception of Oxbryta, all of our other potential product candidates remain in the earlier development stages. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022\nthe market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects, lack of potential efficacy or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to meet applicable regulatory criteria or remain reasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors, if applicable.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize inclacumab or any other product candidates, our business and future prospects may be harmed and our business will be more vulnerable to any problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing Oxbryta.\nIf successful product liability claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use of Oxbryta or our product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to Oxbryta or our product candidates, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\nThe commercialization of Oxbryta, the use of Oxbryta and our product candidates, including inclacumab, in clinical trials and the sale of any other products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. There is a risk that Oxbryta or our product candidates may induce adverse events. The risk of product liability claims may be increased now that Oxbryta is approved and being sold in the United States. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nincreased warnings on product labels or additional restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe recall of Oxbryta or our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize Oxbryta or our product candidates; and\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for Oxbryta or our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.\nWe carry product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are sufficient in light of our current commercial activities and clinical programs, but we may not be able to obtain and maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nDuring the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to our products or product candidates. Such events can be time-consuming to address, could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, can delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products or product candidates, if approved, can require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts of any approved product candidates, or can impair our ability to raise funds to pursue our development or commercialization efforts. Investigations of these events may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may choose to use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on other programs or product candidates that may ultimately be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited resources, we may forego or delay the pursuit of opportunities with programs or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential than those we do pursue. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates, including inclacumab, may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other partnering arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\nAny collaboration, distribution or other arrangements that we might enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe may seek collaboration, distribution or other arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of Oxbryta, inclacumab and potential future product candidates. For example, we have entered into an License and Collaboration Agreement with Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for SCD and beta thalassemia, as well as an exclusive agreement with Biopharma-Middle East and Africa, or Biopharma-MEA,\nto distribute Oxbryta in the GCC region. We may enter into additional collaboration, distribution or other arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for our products or product candidates, both in the United States and internationally. To the extent that we decide to enter into such arrangements, we will face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration, distribution or other arrangement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed arrangement and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for a product or a product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering a product or product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, any uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can occur if there is a challenge to our ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. Moreover, these arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement, and we may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement additional collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we so chose to enter into such arrangements. The terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nAny collaboration, distribution or other arrangement that we enter into may not be successful and may increase our potential liabilities. The success of our arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of us and our partners, who generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. Disagreements between parties to an arrangement regarding research, development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product or product candidate and, in some cases, costly and time-consuming disputes or termination of the arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve successfully, and any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation. In addition, we are reliant on our partners\u2019 compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the region in which they operate, such as in the GCC region with respect to our arrangement with Biopharma-MEA.\nA partner\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law could result in liability for us, and negatively impact our operations and business reputation. Many of such arrangements in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries do not result in successful outcomes, for a wide variety of reasons.\nOur current and anticipated international operations may expose us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, pricing and reimbursement and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business strategy currently incorporates international expansion as we evaluate data from our Phase 3 HOPE Study, plan to conduct additional studies inside and outside the United States, and plan to seek to obtain regulatory approval to commercialize Oxbryta in additional patient populations inside the United States as well as in patient populations outside the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrestrictions and obligations imposed by privacy regulations, such as provisions under the GDPR, applicable to the collection and use of personal health data in the European Union;\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and any requirements to obtain other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\u2022\nfailure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our products in various countries;\n\u2022\nadditional potentially relevant third-party patent rights;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection for and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our current and potential foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay\nsystems;\n\u2022\nlimits in our ability to penetrate international markets;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions;\n\u2022\ncertain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation, and insurance; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions.\nAny such factors may impose additional responsibilities, obligations or liability in relation to our current and planned activities outside the United States, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms and make additional expenditures to ensure compliance with existing and new requirements, which could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations (collectively, \u201cTrade Laws\u201d). We can face serious consequences for violations.\nAmong other matters, Trade Laws prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax\nreassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We also expect our activities outside the United States to increase over time. We engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals, have entered into an exclusive agreement with Biopharma-MEA\nto distribute Oxbryta in the GCC region, and expect to contract with additional third parties with respect to the distribution and commercialization of Oxbryta and our other product candidates in territories outside the United States, if approved for marketing in any such territories. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\nMisconduct or other improper activities of our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our reputation and our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators that would violate the law or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including FDA, healthcare, employment, foreign corrupt practices, environmental, competition, and patient privacy regulations. Misconduct by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators could include intentional or unintentional failures to:\n\u2022\ncomply with EMA or FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nprovide accurate information to the FDA or EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ncomply with cGMP regulations and manufacturing standards that we have established and comply with applicable healthcare fraud and abuse regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nreport financial information or data accurately; or\n\u2022\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us.\nIn particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct could also involve the improper use of, including trading on, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, our business activities may be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S.\ngovernment official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and, therefore, involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S.\ngovernments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.\nThere is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these requirements. We have adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may be ineffective in\ncontrolling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these requirements. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party vendors, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our business and operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party vendors are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, and the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches. With respect to our data and information technology infrastructure, we continue to invest in the protection of such infrastructure, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or identify breaches in our systems.\nIf any such event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could adversely affect our business and operations or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials or nonclinical studies for Oxbryta or any of our product candidates could harm our commercialization activities, result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches. As a result, any such cyber-attacks or breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Equity Securities\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced volatility since our initial public offering in August 2015 and is likely to continue to be volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully develop and commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates, including results relating to our commercialization of Oxbryta in the United States;\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in, or the halting of, our nonclinical studies or clinical trials, especially in our ongoing or future clinical program for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD;\n\u2022\nreports of adverse events from our commercialization or clinical trials of Oxbryta, or from clinical trials of any other product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\nany delay in the review of, or potential action with respect to, our previous or planned filing of any IND, NDA or MAA for Oxbryta, inclacumab or for any other product candidates that we may develop and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA\u2019s or any other regulatory agency\u2019s review of such filing;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions affecting Oxbryta, inclacumab or any other product candidates we may develop, including any delay in or denial of potential approval in accordance with our plans and expectations;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022\nfailure to prosecute, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to Oxbryta or future products;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate product supply for Oxbryta or our product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to enter into or perform under strategic collaborations;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed any financial projections that we or the investment community may provide;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nthe other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, companies trading in the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors, including the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic on the global economy, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. For example, negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta or any of our product candidates, if approved, and the timing and costs of our commercialization activities;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to Oxbryta and our product candidates, which may change from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success or failure of clinical trials for Oxbryta and our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain full regulatory approval for Oxbryta in the United States (including potential pediatric approval) and to obtain regulatory approval of Oxbryta outside of the United States (including potential European approval) as well as regulatory approval for our product candidates, and the timing and scope of any such approvals we may receive;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing Oxbryta and our product candidates, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for Oxbryta and our product candidates, if approved, which may vary significantly;\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n\u2022\nthe risk/benefit profile, cost and reimbursement policies with respect to Oxbryta and our products candidates, if approved, and existing and potential future drugs that compete with Oxbryta and our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwhether Oxbryta or any of our product candidates are subject to any compliance-related challenges or sanctions, or any intellectual-property related challenges; and\n\u2022\nthe changing and volatile U.S., European and global economic environments, including economic volatility as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period\nbasis may not be meaningful. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated financial guidance we may provide.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, would result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe will need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. In August 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3\npursuant to which we may issue up to $200.0 million in shares of common stock in sales deemed to be \u201cat-the-market\nofferings\u201d as defined by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and an unlimited amount of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units. Any sale or issuance of securities pursuant to this registration statement or otherwise may result in dilution to our stockholders and may cause the market price of our stock to decline. Furthermore, new investors purchasing securities that we may issue and sell in the future could obtain rights superior to the rights of our existing stockholders.\nWe are also authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. The\nnumber of shares available for future grant under the 2015 Plan will automatically increase each year by up to 4% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors or compensation committee to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. In addition, in January 2017 our board of directors approved our 2017 Inducement Equity Plan, and thereafter amended and restated the plan as the Amended and Restated 2017 Inducement Plan, or the 2017 Inducement Plan. The 2017 Inducement Plan enables us and our subsidiaries to grant non-qualified\nstock options and other equity-based awards to induce employees who are not currently employed by us or our subsidiaries to accept employment with us or our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, there were 1,277,475 shares reserved under the 2017 Inducement Plan (subject to adjustment for reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, or similar changes in our capital stock) for issuance to new employees entering into employment with us. In addition, we have reserved shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, which number of shares will automatically increase each year on January 1, from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2025, by the lesser of 3,000,000 shares of common stock, (ii) 1% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, or (iii) such lesser number of shares as determined by the administrator of our 2015 ESPP. Currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan and the 2015 ESPP each year. If our board of directors elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant under the 2015 Plan, the 2017 Inducement Plan or the 2015 ESPP, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, and our stock price may fall.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. A significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by a small number of stockholders, including our directors, officers and significant stockholders. Sales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe have also registered or intend to register all shares of our common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. As a result, these shares will be available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options, and restrictions under applicable securities laws. In addition, our directors, executive officers and certain affiliates have established or may in the future establish programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1\nof the Exchange Act for the purpose of effecting sales of our common stock. If any of these events cause a large number of our shares to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, five percent stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 60% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020, based on the latest publicly available information.\nThese stockholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities, and may invest or spend our capital resources in ways with which you do not agree or in ways that ultimately may not increase the value of your investment.\nWe have broad discretion over the use of our capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities. You may not agree with our decisions, and our use of our capital resources may not yield any returns to our stockholders. We expect to use our existing capital resources to continue the commercialization and clinical development of Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD, including in our Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, our other research and development activities including other clinical and nonclinical studies, including for inclacumab, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our failure to apply our capital resources effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy and we might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on our investment of these resources. Our stockholders will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our capital resources.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\ncreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our president;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u2022\nexpressly authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.\nAny provision of our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur future ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future and we may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change\nnet operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change\ntax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We experienced an ownership change as a result of our initial public offering and an ownership change as a result of some of our follow-on\nofferings; however we do not believe that these ownership changes will significantly limit our ability to use these pre-change\nNOL carryforwards. We may experience subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including as a result of our future follow-on\noffering, some of which are outside of our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change\nNOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. On June 29, 2020, California enacted legislation AB 85 limiting our ability to use our state NOLs and imposing a cap on the amount of business incentives tax credits (R&D credit) for taxable years 2020, 2021, and 2022. In addition, pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020), we may not use net operating loss carry-forwards arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 to reduce our taxable income in any year beginning after December 31, 2020 by more than 80% and we may not carry back any net operating losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2020 to prior years. These new rules apply regardless of the occurrence of an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to invest in and expand our business and meet our financial obligations, to attract and retain third-party contractors and collaboration partners and to raise additional capital depends on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to numerous factors, including the prevailing economic and political conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control, such as the rate of unemployment (particularly as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic), the number of uninsured persons in the United States, the results of presidential elections, other political influences and inflationary pressures. For\nexample, an overall decrease in or loss of insurance coverage among individuals in the United States as a result of unemployment, underemployment or the potential repeal of certain provisions of the ACA, may decrease the demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the availability of healthcare services and resources is currently constrained due to the COVID-19\npandemic. If fewer patients are seeking medical care because they do not have insurance coverage or are unable to obtain medical care for their conditions due to resource constraints on the healthcare system, we may experience difficulties in the commercialization of Oxbryta and any eventual commercialization of our product candidates, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, certain events have caused, and may cause or contribute to global financial crises, which have triggered and may in the future lead to extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. For example, in January 2020, the U.K. formally exited from the EU (such event commonly known as Brexit). Brexit has and could continue to adversely affect European and/or worldwide economic and market conditions and could continue to contribute to instability in the global financial markets and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our existing relationships with third parties that conduct some of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials and our ability to enter into new relationships with vendors and other third-party contractors, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. The measures could also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, potentially disrupt the markets in which we currently conduct and plan to conduct operations and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, changes in, and legal uncertainty with regard to, national and international laws and regulations may present difficulties for our clinical and regulatory strategy.\nA severe or prolonged economic downturn, including as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our relationships with our contractors and potential collaboration partners. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the COVID-19\npandemic, current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe incur significant costs, and expend significant time and effort, to comply with the rules applicable to us as a public company, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to comply with these rules, including maintaining proper and effective systems of disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, and we could be subject to sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, Section 404, or Section 404, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. The Exchange Act requires us to file accurate and timely quarterly, annual and current reports with the SEC. Section 404 generally requires our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and requires us to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are also subject to significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank, including the \u201csay on pay\u201d rules adopted by the SEC under Dodd-Frank. We incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, and expend significant time and effort by management and other personnel, to comply with the rules applicable to us as a public company.\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the reports required by Section 404. Based on our assessment and using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, criteria, our\nmanagement, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. As required under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, our independent registered public accounting firm has tested the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting and has provided the required attestation report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. During the course of our or their subsequent review and testing, however, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified and we may be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required reports. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future, we may not detect or remediate errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from NASDAQ or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\nMoreover, stockholder activism, the current political environment, and increased levels of government scrutiny and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations for public companies, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to any new compliance initiatives. In addition, any new rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and rules adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements.\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes, outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19\npandemic) or other natural disasters, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nEarthquakes, outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19\npandemic) or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. As a result of the COVID-19\npandemic, we have been prevented from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, and future events (including pandemics, earthquakes, power outages or natural disasters) may prevent us in the future from using all or a significant portion of our facilities. In addition, damage to or restrictions on the use of critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers or other facilities critical to our research and development activities, may render it difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue certain aspects of our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third\nparties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nWe may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders or us. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, in December 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which made broad and complex changes to the tax laws. We cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or decided, which could result in an increase in our, or our stockholders\u2019, tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize increases in our tax liability.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts may not publish an adequate amount of research on our company, which may negatively impact the trading price for our stock. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline or increase in volatility. Further, if our operating results fail to meet the forecasts of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 15638, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "GBT"}
