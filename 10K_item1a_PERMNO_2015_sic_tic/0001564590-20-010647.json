{"cik": "1023313", "company": "FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nWe operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment that involves risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\nA Decline in Renewals or Demand for Our Subscription-Based Research, Connect and Analytics Services. Our success depends in large part upon retaining (on both a client company and dollar basis) and enriching existing subscriptions for our Research, Connect, and Analytics products and services. Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment, or failure to generate demand for and new sales of our subscription-based products and services due to competition or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDemand for Our Advisory and Consulting Services. Advisory and consulting services revenues comprised 29% of our total revenues in 2019 and 32% of our total revenues in 2018. Consulting engagements generally are project-based and non-recurring. A decline in our ability to fulfill existing or generate new project consulting engagements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Business May be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment. Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions. The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services. If conditions in the United States and the global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our products and services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations. As of December 31, 2019, we have clients in approximately 76 countries and approximately 21% of our revenues come from international sales. Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable, and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions. Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations. If any of these arrangements are terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients sourced by the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.\nWe Face Risks Related to Health Epidemics That Could Adversely Impact Our Business. Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, or COVID-19. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. This could include disruptions or restrictions on the ability of our employees or our customers to travel and a slowdown in the global economy, which could adversely affect our ability to sell or fulfill, and a reduction in demand for, our products, services or events. Any disruption or delay of our customers or third-party service providers would likely impact our operating results. Our Events business generated $27.0 million of revenues during 2019. On March 13, 2020, due to considerations of the effect of COVID-19, we announced that we will be holding our SiriusDecisions Summit 2020, our single largest event, as a virtual event during its originally scheduled timeframe in May 2020. We estimate the impact of holding this event as a virtual event, as compared to a live event, will reduce revenues by $7.0 million to $9.0 million and will reduce operating income by $4.0 million to $6.0 million. However, the ultimate financial impact may be affected by a number of factors including the number of attendees and sponsors and our ability to recoup certain costs for the event. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 remains difficult to project and our business and financial results may be materially and adversely affected by it.\nOur Business Could Suffer as a Result of the United Kingdom\u2019s Decision to End Its Membership in the European Union. Our London office serves as our European headquarters and is our second largest location in terms of headcount. The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (generally referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding both this office and our business generally, including affecting our relationships with existing and potential customers, suppliers, and employees. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt some of our target markets\nand jurisdictions in which we operate, and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Brexit also may create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers and potential customers to monitor their costs and reduce their budgets for our products and services. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAbility to Develop and Offer New Products and Services. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services. These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors. The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly. We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.\nLoss of Key Management. Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees. The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.\nThe Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff. Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research and data professionals, consultants, and experienced sales and marketing personnel. Thus, our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates. Our future success will also depend in part upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership in hiring and retaining sales personnel and in improving sales productivity. We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals. If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.\nFailure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends. Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research, data, advisory services, and other related products and services to meet the changing needs of our clients. The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes. The environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies, and advice on issues of importance to them. Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources. Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.\nWe May Experience Difficulties in Integrating the Operations of Acquired Companies into Our Business and in Realizing the Expected Benefits of the Acquisitions. The success of our recent acquisitions of SiriusDecisions, FeedbackNow and GlimpzIt will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities from combining the operations of these companies with our business in an efficient and effective manner. For 2020, we determined that SiriusDecisions will no longer operate under a separate management structure. Our internal management and reporting will be aligned to consolidate each of the SiriusDecisions products and related operations under a single, combined organization within our existing Products and Research segments. If we are unable to successfully or timely effect these changes, we may not realize the benefits that we currently anticipate will result from having a single, combined organization within our existing Products and Research segments.\nWe Have Outstanding Debt Which Could Materially Restrict our Business and Adversely Affect our Financial Condition, Liquidity and Results of Operations. In connection with the SiriusDecisions acquisition, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") that provides for a $125.0 million term loan facility and a $75.0 million revolving credit facility. All of the proceeds of the term loans and $50.0 million borrowed under the revolving credit facility were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt of $132.8 million under the Credit Agreement (see Note 4 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). The debt service requirements of these credit arrangements could impair our future financial condition and operating results. In addition, the affirmative, negative and financial covenants of the Credit Agreement could limit our future financial flexibility. A failure to comply with these covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding, which could materially impact our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders. No assurance can be given that we would be successful in doing so, or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those currently. The outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us, which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital.\nWe May be Subject to Network Disruptions or Security Breaches that Could Damage Our Reputation and Harm Our Business and Operating Results. We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism. Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.\nCompetition. We compete principally in the market for research, data and advisory services, with an emphasis on customer behavior and customer experience, and the impact of technology on our clients\u2019 business and service models. Our principal direct competitors include other independent providers of research and advisory services, such as Gartner, as well as marketing agencies, general business consulting firms, survey-based general market research firms, providers of peer networking services, and digital media measurement services. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do. In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies. We also face competition from free sources of information available on the Internet, such as Google. Our indirect competitors could choose to compete directly against us in the future. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into certain segments of our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more of these market segments. Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.\nFailure to Enforce and Protect our Intellectual Property Rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Unauthorized third parties may obtain or use our proprietary information despite our efforts to protect it. The laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States and accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized use or distribution, which could adversely affect our business.\nPrivacy Laws. Privacy laws and regulations, and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations, in the U.S, Europe and other countries around the world where we conduct business are sometimes inconsistent and frequently changing. This includes, but is not limited to, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. Compliance with these laws, or changing interpretations and application of these laws, could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to take action in a manner that would be adverse to our business.\nFluctuations in Our Operating Results. Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nTrends in technology and research, data and advisory services spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.\n\u2022\nThe timing and size of new and renewal subscriptions for our products and services from clients.\n\u2022\nThe utilization of our advisory services by our clients.\n\u2022\nThe timing of revenue-generating events sponsored by us.\n\u2022\nThe introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.\n\u2022\nThe hiring and training of new research and data professionals, consultants, and sales personnel.\n\u2022\nChanges in demand for our research, data and advisory services.\n\u2022\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\u2022\nAn increase in the interest rates applicable to our outstanding debt obligations.\nAs a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock. Factors such as announcements of new products, services, offices, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or in the research, data and professional services industries generally, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.\nTaxation Risks. We operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world. A portion of our income is generated outside of the United States and is taxed at lower rates than rates applicable to income generated in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions in which we do business. Our effective tax rate in the future, and accordingly our results of operations and financial position, could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax law or if more of our income becomes taxable in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.\nConcentration of Ownership. Our largest stockholder is our Chairman and CEO, George F. Colony, who owns approximately 42% of our outstanding stock. This concentration of ownership enables Mr. Colony to strongly influence or effectively control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and sales or purchases of assets. This concentration of ownership may also limit the liquidity of our stock. As a result, efforts by stockholders to change the direction, management or ownership of Forrester may be unsuccessful, and stockholders may not be able to freely purchase and sell shares of our stock.\nAny Weakness Identified in Our System of Internal Controls by Us and Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls. There can be no assurance that no weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will occur in future periods, or that any such weakness will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, including our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner.", "PERMNO": 84210, "SIC": 8700, "TIC": "FORR"}
