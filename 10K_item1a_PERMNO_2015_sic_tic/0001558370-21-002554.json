{"cik": "1476034", "company": "Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and the trading price of its common stock.\nRisks Related to the COVD-19 Outbreak\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Novel Coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments have placed restrictions on businesses and residents. This has resulted in a slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment; and the stock markets have been highly volatile, and the value of bank stocks has been significantly impacted. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve reduced the benchmark fed funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10- and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and passed legislation to provide relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Finally, the spread of COVID-19 has caused the Bank to modify its business practices, including employee travel, implementing social-distancing protocols and requiring face coverings in public areas of Company facilities, and placing limitations on physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. The Bank may take further actions that may be required by government authorities or that the Bank determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Bank. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when COVID-19 can be controlled and abated resulting in a meaningful increase in economic activity. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, the Bank could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u25cf demand for the Bank\u2019s products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u25cf if the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charge-offs and reduced income;\n\u25cf collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u25cf due to recent legislation and government action limiting foreclosure of real property and reduced governmental capacity to effect business transactions and property transfers, the Bank may have more difficulty taking possession of collateral supporting its loans, which may negatively impact its ability to minimize losses, which could adversely impact its financial results;\n\u25cf access to collateral for existing loans and new loan production may be difficult as a result of COVID-19 making it difficult to obtain, on a timely basis, appraisals on the collateral;\n\u25cf the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect its net income;\n\u25cf the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to the Bank;\n\u25cf as the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate, the yield on the Bank\u2019s assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in its cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing its net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u25cf if legislation is enacted or governmental or regulatory action is enacted limiting the amount of ATM fees or surcharges that the Bank may receive or on its ability to charge overdraft or other fees, it could adversely impact the Bank\u2019s financial results;\n\u25cf the Bank\u2019s cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increased use of the Bank\u2019s online banking platform and an increase in the number of employees working remotely;\n\u25cf the Bank relies on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on it; and\n\u25cf Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, the Company\u2019s future success and profitability substantially depends on the skills of its employees, including executive directors and officers, many of whom have held their positions with the Company for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees and/or a large number of employees due to the outbreak could harm the Company\u2019s ability to operate or execute its business strategy. The Company may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable replacements in the event of such employee loss or unavailability.\nRisks Related to Lending Activities\nA substantial portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio consists of CRE, multi-family real estate loans and commercial loans, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.\nCRE, multi-family real estate and commercial loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of loans since payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved. Accordingly, a downturn in the real estate market and/or a challenging business and economic environment may increase the Bank\u2019s risk related to CRE, multi-family real estate and commercial loans. If the cash flows from business operations is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Further, due to the larger average size of such loans and that they are secured by collateral that is generally less readily-marketable as compared with other loan types, losses incurred on a small number of such loans could have a material adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, CRE loan concentration is an area that has experienced heightened regulatory focus. Under CRE guidance issued by banking regulators, banks with holdings of CRE, land development, construction, and certain multi-family loans in excess of certain thresholds must employ heightened risk management practices. These loans are also subject to written policies that establish certain limits and standards. Such compliance requirements imposed on the Company\u2019s CRE, multi-family or construction lending and the potential limits to the generation of these types of loans could have material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the Bank intends to continue to increase its commercial loans, its credit risk may increase.\nThe Bank intends to increase its portfolio of commercial loans, including working capital lines of credit, equipment financing, healthcare and medical receivables, documentary letters of credit and standby letters of credit. These loans\ngenerally have more risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and commercial loans secured by real estate. Since repayment of commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of borrowers\u2019 businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local and national economy. In addition, commercial loans generally have a larger average size as compared with other loans such as residential loans, and the collateral for commercial loans is generally less readily-marketable. The Bank\u2019s plans to increase its portfolio of these loans could result in increased credit risk in the portfolio. An adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the Bank to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan or a commercial real estate loan.\nIf the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings could decrease.\nLoan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of their loans, and the collateral securing the payment of their loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Bank may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. Various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio are made, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the quality of its loan portfolio and its loss and delinquency experience and evaluates industry trends and economic conditions.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of allowance is subject to judgment and requires the Bank to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. If assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not cover losses in the loan portfolio at the date of the financial statements. Significant additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the allowance for loan losses, the policies and procedures the Bank uses to determine the level of the allowance and the value attributed to non-performing loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the Bank to recognize loan charge-offs. Any significant increase in allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risk Factors - The FASB issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how the Company recognizes credit losses, which may have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\u201d\nThe performance of the Bank\u2019s multi-family and mixed-use loans could be adversely impacted by regulation.\nMulti-family and mixed-use loans generally involve a greater risk than one- to-four family residential loans because of legislation and government regulations involving rent control and rent stabilization, which are outside the control of the borrower or the Bank, and could impair the value of the security for the loan or the future cash flows of such properties. On June 14, 2019, the State of New York enacted legislation increasing restrictions on rent increases in a rent-regulated apartment building, including, among other provisions, (i) repealing the \u201cvacancy bonus\u201d and \u201clongevity bonus,\u201d which allowed a property owner to raise rents as much as 20% each time a rental unit became vacant, (ii) eliminating high-rent vacancy deregulation and high-income deregulation, which allowed a rental unit to be removed from rent stabilization once it crossed a statutory high-rent threshold and became vacant, or the tenant\u2019s income exceeded the statutory amount in the preceding two years, and (iii) eliminating an exception that allowed a property owner who offered preferential rents to tenants to raise the rent to the full legal rent upon renewal. The legislation still permits a property owner to charge up to the full legal rent once the tenant vacates. As a result, it is possible that rental income on certain rent-regulated properties might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses (e.g., utilities, taxes, etc.). At December 31, 2020, the Bank has $187.2 million of rent-regulated stabilized multi-family loans, which had a weighted-average loan-to-value of 44.5%, a weighted average debt coverage ratio of 1.8x and a weighted average debt yield of 12.2%.\nAdditionally, in order to provide meaningful support to homeowners struggling financially as a result of the COVID-19, several federal, state and local agencies have placed moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures within their respective jurisdictions.\nAs a result of these legislative and regulatory actions as well as previously existing laws and regulations, it is possible that, if the cash flows from a collateral property is reduced (e.g., if leases are not obtained or renewed; or rental income cannot be collected and a non-paying tenant cannot be replaced), a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan and the value of the security for the loan may be impaired. Therefore, it may be more difficult to identify impaired multi-family and mixed-use loans before they become problematic than residential loans.\nThe Bank could be subject to environmental risks and associated costs on its foreclosed real estate assets, which could materially and adversely affect it.\nA material portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by real estate. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic waste could be discovered on the properties that secure these loans. If the Bank acquires such properties as a result of foreclosure, it could be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up or removing this waste, and this cost could exceed the value of the underlying properties and materially and adversely affect the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nA downturn in economic conditions could cause deterioration in credit quality, which could depress net income and growth.\nThe Bank\u2019s principal economic risk is the creditworthiness of its borrowers, which is affected by the strength of the relevant business market segment, local market conditions, and general economic conditions. The Bank\u2019s loan portfolio includes many real estate secured loans, demand for which may decrease during economic downturns as a result of, among other things, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values and a slowdown in housing. If negative economic conditions develop in the New York market or the United States, the Bank could experience higher delinquencies and loan charge-offs, which would adversely affect its net income and financial condition. Furthermore, to the extent that real estate collateral is obtained through foreclosure, the costs of holding and marketing real estate collateral, as well as the ultimate values obtained from disposition, could reduce earnings and adversely affect the Bank\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Bank\u2019s business and operations may be adversely affected by weak economic conditions.\nThe Bank\u2019s business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, growth and profitability from the Bank\u2019s lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States.\nThe Bank\u2019s business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond the Bank\u2019s control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Bank.\nA substantial majority of the Bank\u2019s loans and operations are in New York, and therefore its business is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the New York City economy.\nThe Bank is a community banking institution that provides banking services to the local communities in the market areas in which it operates, and therefore, its ability to diversify its economic risks is limited by its own local markets and economies. A large portion of the Bank\u2019s business is concentrated in New York, and in New York City in particular. A significant decline in local economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond the Bank\u2019s control, would likely cause an increase in the rates of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses in its loan portfolio.\nAs a result, a downturn in the local economy, generally and the real estate market specifically, could significantly reduce the Bank\u2019s profitability and growth and adversely affect its financial condition.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. The Bank\u2019s earnings and cash flows depend, to a great extent, upon the level of its net interest income (the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments, other interest earning assets, and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings). Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes.\nWhen interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree, than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree, than interest bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and the Bank\u2019s ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect the Bank through, among other things, increased prepayments on its loan portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect the Bank\u2019s net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume and overall results.\nThe Bank\u2019s securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand.\nRisk Related to the Bank\u2019s Operations\nA failure in the Bank\u2019s operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair the Bank\u2019s liquidity, disrupt its businesses, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and cause financial losses.\nThe Bank\u2019s operations rely on its computer systems, networks and third-party providers for the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive customer information. The Bank\u2019s business, and in particular, the debit card and cash management solutions business, is dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions, as well as the information technology services provided to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth and geographical reach of the Bank\u2019s client base, developing and maintaining its operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. This is further exacerbated by the increased cybersecurity risks that exist during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlthough the Bank takes protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Furthermore, the Bank may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect themselves from cyber-attacks or to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. Given the increasingly high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. In addition, the increasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks, both generally and in the financial services industry, have enhanced government and\nregulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-security threats. As these threats and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend additional resources to enhance or expand upon the security measures it currently maintains. Although the Bank has developed, and continues to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks, a breach of its systems or those of processors could result in: losses to the Bank and its customers; loss of business and/or customers; damage to its reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses (including the cost of notification to consumers, credit monitoring and forensics, and fees and fines imposed by the card networks); disruption to its business; an inability to grow its online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or the exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability - any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank faces risks related to its operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to grow and compete is dependent on its ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure as it expands. Similar to other large corporations, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside persons and exposure to external events. In addition, the Bank is heavily dependent on the strength and capability of its technology systems, which are used both to interface with customers and manage internal financial and other systems. The Bank\u2019s ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of its existing customers and attract new ones depends on the functionality of its technology systems.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Bank\u2019s future success will depend in part upon its ability to address the needs of its clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to provide secure electronic environments and create additional efficiencies in its operations as it continues to grow and expand its market area. The Bank continuously monitors its operational and technological capabilities and makes modifications and improvements when it believes it will be cost effective to do so. Many of the Bank\u2019s larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in operational and technological infrastructure. As a result, competitors may be able to offer more convenient products than the Bank, which would put it at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe Bank also outsources some of its operational and technological infrastructure, including modifications and improvements to these systems, to third parties. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, fail to comply with banking regulations or terminate their services and if the Bank is unable to replace them with other service providers, its operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if the Bank were able to replace the third-party providers, it may be at a higher cost, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject the Bank to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and have a material adverse impact on its reputation. Misconduct by its employees could include concealing unauthorized activities, engaging in improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions the Bank takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject the Bank to financial claims for negligence.\nThe Bank maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank relies heavily on its executive management team and other key employees and could be adversely affected by the unexpected loss of their services.\nThe Bank\u2019s success depends in large part on the performance of its key personnel, as well as on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute its business plan may be lengthy. The Bank may not be successful in retaining its key employees, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business because of their skills, knowledge of primary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If the services of any key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, the Bank may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on acceptable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects of the Bank.\nIf the Bank\u2019s enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating interest rate risk, market risk and strategic risk, it could suffer unexpected losses and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Bank\u2019s enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing stockholder value. The Bank has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including credit, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance and reputational risks. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to these risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that have not been appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Bank\u2019s risk management framework proves ineffective, it could suffer unexpected losses and its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Bank\u2019s business. The Bank relies on its ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of loans to ensure that there is adequate liquidity to fund its operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. The Bank\u2019s most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff, which are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, local and national economic conditions, the availability and attractiveness of alternative investments and competing deposits. Further, the demand for the deposit products offered may be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers\u2019 disposable income or the monetary policy of the FRB, regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, the Bank would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, which would increase its funding costs and reduce net interest income. Any changes made to the rates offered on deposit products to remain competitive with other financial institutions may also adversely affect profitability and liquidity.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the FHLB of New York. The Bank also has an available line of credit with FRBNY discount window. The Bank also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. The Bank\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities, or on terms that are acceptable, could be impaired by factors that affect the Bank directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry, a decrease in the level of the Bank\u2019s business activity as a result of a downturn in markets or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against the Bank.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact the Bank\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther Risks Related to the Bank\u2019s Business\nThe Bank may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, which is expected to be extended to June 30, 2023. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the FRB and the FRBNY identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rate.\nThe Bank has a significant number of loans, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change the Bank\u2019s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with customers could adversely impact the Bank\u2019s reputation or could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank is exposed to the risks of natural disasters and global market disruptions.\nThe Bank handles a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions every day. Its financial, accounting, data processing, check processing, electronic funds transfer, loan processing, online and mobile banking, automated teller machines, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including major physical infrastructure outages, natural disasters or events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts, pandemics, and cyber-attacks. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and cause reputational harm.\nAdditionally, global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyber-attacks or campaigns, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Global market disruptions may affect the Bank\u2019s business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the United States or abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenue and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels.\nRisks Related to the Bank\u2019s Global Payments Business\nThe Bank faces intense competition in the global payments industry.\nThe global payments industry is highly competitive, continuously changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. Many areas in which the Bank competes evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, shifting user preferences and needs, price sensitivity of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge, businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships, and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business.\nThe Bank competes with a wide range of businesses, some of which are larger operationally and/or financially, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than the Bank, or offer products and services that the Bank does not offer, which may provide them significant competitive advantages. Some competitors may also be subject to less burdensome regulatory requirements or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile and effective in responding quickly to user needs, technological innovations, and legal and regulatory changes. These competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, and/or offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs, products, and services. If the Bank is not able to differentiate its\nproducts and services from those of its competitors, drive value for customers, or effectively and efficiently align its resources with its goals and objectives, the Bank may not be able to compete effectively in the market.\nChanges in card network fees could impact operations.\nCard networks periodically increase the fees (known as interchange fees) that are charged to acquirers and that the Bank charges to its merchants. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in the Bank absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would its increase costs, reduce profit margin and adversely affect its business and financial condition. In addition, the card networks require certain capital requirements. An increase in the required capital level would further limit the use of capital for other purposes.\nThe Bank\u2019s business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of prepaid cards as a payment mechanism or if\nthere are adverse developments with respect to the prepaid financial services industry in general.\nAs the prepaid financial services industry evolves, consumers may find prepaid financial services to be less attractive than traditional or other financial services. If consumers do not continue or increase their usage of prepaid cards, including making changes in the way prepaid cards are loaded, the Bank\u2019s operating revenues and prepaid card deposits may remain at current levels or decline. Any projected growth for the industry may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated. If consumer acceptance of prepaid financial services does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than expected or if there is a shift in the mix of payment forms away from the Bank\u2019s products and services, it could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Competitive Matters\nThe Bank operates in a highly competitive industry and faces significant competition from other financial\ninstitutions and financial services providers, the result of which may decrease growth or profits.\nThe Bank\u2019s market area contains not only a large number of community and regional banks, but also a significant presence of the country\u2019s largest commercial banks and the growing presence of FinTech financial services companies. The Bank competes with other state and national financial institutions, savings and loan associations, savings banks, credit unions and other companies offering financial services. Some of these competitors have a longer history of successful operations nationally and in the New York market area, greater ties to businesses expansive banking relationships, more established depositor bases, fewer regulatory constraints, better technology, and lower cost structures than the Bank does. Competitors with greater resources may possess an advantage through their ability to maintain numerous banking locations in more convenient sites, conduct more extensive promotional and advertising campaigns, or operate a more developed technology platform. Due to their size, many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services, as well as better pricing for certain products and services than the Bank can offer. Further, increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions may adversely affect the Bank\u2019s ability to market its products and services.\nIn addition, the Bank\u2019s legally mandated lending limits are lower than those of certain of its competitors that have greater capital. Lower lending limits may discourage borrowers with lending needs that exceed these limits from doing business with the Bank. The Bank may try to serve such borrowers by selling loan participations to other financial institutions; however, this strategy may not succeed.\nRisks Related to Business Strategy\nThe Bank may not be able to grow and if it does, it may have difficulty managing that growth.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to grow depends, in part, upon its ability to expand its market share, successfully attract deposits, and identify loan and investment opportunities as well as opportunities to generate fee-based income. The Bank may not be successful in increasing the volume of loans and deposits at acceptable levels and upon terms it finds acceptable. The Bank may also not be successful in expanding its operations organically or through strategic acquisitions while managing the costs and implementation risks associated with this growth strategy.\nThe Bank expects to grow the number of employees and customers and the scope of its operations, but it may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or continue to grow its business at all. Its success will depend upon the ability of its officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve operational and other systems, to manage multiple, concurrent customer relationships, and to hire, train and manage employees. In the event that the Bank is unable to perform all these tasks and meet these challenges effectively, including continuing its operations, and consequently its earnings, could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the FASB or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators, outside auditors or management) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be hard to predict, and can materially impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in it needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements. For more information on changes in accounting standards, see Note 3 to the audited financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe FASB issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how the\nCompany recognizes credit losses, which may have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model. Under the CECL model, the Company will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity (\u201cHTM\u201d) debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the statement of financial condition and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, the Company expects that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how it determines allowance for loan losses and could require it to significantly increase the allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of allowance for loan losses. If the Company is required to materially increase its level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe new CECL standard will become effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on its accounting; however, it expects to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective. The Company cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on its financial condition or results of operations.\nRisk Related to Laws and Regulation and Their Enforcement\nThe Company and the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern it.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies that govern almost all aspects of their operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect the Company\u2019s stockholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers,\ndepositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the overall financial stability of the U.S economy. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which the Company or the Bank can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to it, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee its debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in capital than GAAP would require. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly, and changes to these laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the Company or the Bank to restrictions on their business activities, fines and other penalties, the commencement of informal or formal enforcement actions against them, and other negative consequences, including reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations, capital base and the price of its securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed higher capital requirements on bank holding companies and changed the rules regarding FDIC insurance premiums. Compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations has and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects of the Company.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase the Company\u2019s costs and impact its business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Certain aspects of current regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted: could expose it to additional costs, including increased compliance costs; impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities; require more oversight; or change certain of its business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the FRB could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. Recently, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.", "PERMNO": 17093, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MCB"}
