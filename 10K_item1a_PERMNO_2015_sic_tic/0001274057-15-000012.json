{"cik": "1274057", "company": "HOSPIRA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a highly regulated, highly competitive, global business in which significant attention is placed upon research and development, intellectual property rights, product safety, product quality, product supply, and manufacturing capabilities. As a consequence, we face risks generally encountered by businesses operating globally, but also the risks and uncertainties described below, that are particular to our industry and business operations. These risks and uncertainties may cause our sales, results of operations, and cash flows to fluctuate significantly. Our past performance may not be indicative of future performance and our actual performance may differ materially from our prior expectations or projections. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact or impair our business operations.\nCompetition, Marketing and Product Development\nWe face significant competition. Our efforts to compete may not be effective and may result in additional costs and charges and lost sales opportunities.\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive. We compete with many companies ranging from small, highly focused companies to large diversified healthcare manufacturers that have access to greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources. Our competitors have been consolidating, as have our customers, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures, causing competition to become more intense as those larger companies address a more concentrated customer base. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or non-economical by technological advances by competitors or by the introduction of competing products by one or more of our competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nTo remain competitive and bolster our competitive position, we believe we must successfully execute various strategic plans, including expanding our research and development initiatives, globally expanding our portfolio of products, globally expanding the markets in which we do business, differentiating our products, lowering our operating costs, improving our quality and business processes, and streamlining and modernizing our portfolio of on-market medication management products. These initiatives may result in significant expenditures and ultimately may not be successful. If our global expansion efforts do not drive expected volume increases, we may not be able to fully utilize our manufacturing footprint, which could result in asset impairment charges, customer accommodations, contract termination charges, restructuring, and other exit related charges.\nIf we do not successfully introduce new products in a timely manner, our sales, cash flow, and operating results may decline.\nEffective execution of research and development activities and timely introduction of products to market are important elements of our business strategy. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time, causing our sales and operating results to suffer. If we do not continue to develop new products in a\ntimely manner, our competitors may develop products that are more competitive, and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand group purchasing organizations' pricing agreements or to obtain new agreements. We face similar risks if we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our medication management portfolio.\nThe ability to launch a generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before generic or biosimilar market formation is important to that product's profitability. Prices for products typically decline, sometimes dramatically, following market formation, as additional companies receive approvals to market that product and competition intensifies. If a company can be \"first-to-market,\" such that the branded drug is the only other competition for a period of time, higher levels of sales and profitability can be achieved until other competitors enter the market. With increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market, the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar products will increase in importance. If we are unable to bring our generic or biosimilar products to market on a timely basis, and secure \"first-to-market\" positions, our sales and profit opportunities could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, we may have fewer opportunities to launch significant generic pharmaceutical products in the future, as the number and size of proprietary products that are subject to patent expirations or challenges may decrease in the next several years compared to historical levels.\nProduct development requires substantial investment that may be difficult for us to fund and may be challenging to recover through commercial product sales.\nInnovations generally require a substantial investment in product development before we can determine their commercial viability, and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations. Even if we succeed in creating new product candidates from these innovations, those innovations still may fail to result in commercially successful products. The success of new product offerings for both pharmaceutical and device products depends on several factors, including our ability to anticipate and meet customers'/patients' needs, obtain timely regulatory approvals or clearances, and manufacture quality products in an economic and timely manner. Even if we are able to develop successfully new products or enhancements, we may not produce sales exceeding the costs of development, and we may not avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Further, those new or enhanced products may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by competitors of products embodying new technologies or features. Moreover, innovations may not be successful due to difficulties encountered in achieving positive clinical outcomes, meeting safety, efficacy or other regulatory requirements of government agencies, or obtaining favorable pricing on those products. Finally, innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice and uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.\nOur industry places heavy emphasis on intellectual property rights. Our ability to protect our rights can affect our sales opportunities and profitability.\nOur industry relies heavily on trade secrets, confidentiality agreements, continuing technological innovation and, in some cases, patent, trademark and service mark protection to preserve competitive position. A failure to protect intellectual property can harm business and prospects.\nMost of our products are not protected by patents or other proprietary rights, and have limited or no market exclusivity. Patent filings by third parties could render our intellectual property less valuable. In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries outside the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position. Competitors also may harm sales of our products by designing products that mirror the capabilities of those products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain or maintain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and future sales.\nOur efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate or effective. Please see the section captioned \"Patent-Related Product Matters\" in \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this report for a discussion of generic competition to Precedex\u2122.\nIf we infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we may face legal action, adverse damage awards, increased costs, and delays in marketing new products.\nPart of our business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which may involve litigation, associated costs and time delays, and may, ultimately not be successful. Those opportunities may arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent\nbranded products has expired, where patents have been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. To achieve a \"first-to-market\" or early market position for generic pharmaceutical products and biosimilar, we may take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable.\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant damages. We are involved in patent-related disputes with companies over our attempts to market generic pharmaceutical products. Once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceuticals, we may decide to commercially market these products even though associated legal proceedings have not been resolved. If those proceedings ultimately determine that our products infringe the patent rights of another company, we may face damages, including a requirement to pay a reasonable royalty or the lost profits from the sale of the branded product. Remedies also may include or consist of an injunction preventing us from further manufacture or sales of the affected product. Any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of biosimilar products poses unique risks, including substantial development costs and evolving regulation. Our failure to successfully introduce biosimilar products could have a negative impact on our business and future operating results.\nWe are actively working to develop and commercialize biosimilar products through internal efforts as well as external collaborations with third parties. Those efforts involve:\n\u2022\nsignificant development costs and lead time. For internally developed biosimilar candidates, product development costs, including clinical trials and manufacturing start-up, could be up to $100-$200 million per biosimilar candidate over a 7-8 year period. The cost to develop each biosimilar candidate could vary significantly and is highly dependent on the specific compound and the amount and type of clinical work necessary for regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that our clinical work will be successful;\n\u2022\nreliance upon third parties. We have entered into agreements with other companies for the manufacturing, development and marketing of biosimilar product candidates. In 2009, we entered into an agreement to develop and market certain biosimilar molecules with Celltrion (including Inflectra\u2122). The success of our ability to commercialize products from the Celltrion agreement will depend on Celltrion's ability to develop, manufacture and gain approval for its products. We may also enter into additional alliances to fund research and development activities, such as our arrangement with NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund I, L.P.; and, the success of the biosimilar program may depend on our ability to realize the benefits under such arrangements;\n\u2022\ncompliance with developing and evolving regulatory requirements. Although draft guidance has been released by the FDA, significant uncertainty remains concerning the regulatory pathway in the U.S. to obtain approval of biosimilar products and the commercial pathway to market and sell successfully those products. As those regulatory requirements evolve and become clearer, we will need to analyze and incorporate them into our biosimilar development plans. Those regulatory developments, and developments from other regulatory bodies, will have a direct effect upon the costs of development and approval and the probability of success for our biosimilar candidates;\n\u2022\naddressing intellectual property matters. Biosimilar products likely may be subject to extensive patent clearances and patent infringement litigation, which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product for many years;\n\u2022\naddressing limitations on the manufacture and use of biologic materials. The development, manufacture, distribution and sale of biosimilars poses unique risks, including risks related to the supply and distribution of the materials needed to manufacture biosimilars. Access to, and the supply of, necessary biological materials may be limited, and government regulations restrict access to, and regulate the transport and use of, such materials; and\n\u2022\ngaining market and patient acceptance. Market success of biosimilar products will depend on our ability to demonstrate to patients, physicians and payers that those products are safe and efficacious compared to other existing products, yet offer a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies.\nDue to events beyond our control or the risks discussed in this Item 1A., we may not be able to fund all or some of our biosimilar research and development initiatives, which would have an adverse impact on our strategy and growth initiatives. Further, we may not be able to generate future sales of biosimilar products in certain jurisdictions and may not realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in the development, manufacture and sale of those products.\nEven after our products receive regulatory approval, those products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our pharmaceutical products, generic or proprietary, including, among other products, biosimilars, the success of those products depends on market acceptance. Market acceptance for our products could be impacted by several factors, including, results from FDA or other regulatory agency required studies for additional indications, post-launch studies, and various other life-cycle management or enhancement programs. Negative results, or perceived negative results, could adversely affect the product indications, approvals and sales of our on-market products. Those studies can call into question the use, safety, and efficacy of currently marketed and future products. In some cases, studies for other companies have resulted, and may in the future result for others or us, in the delay or loss of marketing approval, the discontinuance of product marketing, changes in product labeling or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product, the need for other risk management programs (e.g., a patient registry). Also, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products implicating (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of our products. And, new data about our products, or products similar to our products, could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. As, for example, our biosimilar development programs progress, we expect that over the next several years the amount of spending to increase on these incremental life-cycle studies for currently approved, on-market, biosimilars. Costs for on-market biosimilars can include studies to demonstrate additional indications, regulator required post-launch studies, and various other life-cycle management or enhancement programs. The occurrence of any of the above risks could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, and/or increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements, any or all of which could adversely affect our profitability, financial condition, and results of operations and/or cash flow.\nWe may not be able to realize all of the expected benefits of our global Device Strategy, could incur additional costs to execute the strategy, or could encounter unforeseen difficulties in implementing the strategy, all of which could adversely affect our business or operating results.\nIn May 2013, we announced our Device Strategy, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. The Device Strategy is described in the section captioned \"Device Strategy\" in \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this Report. As described in Item 7, we expect to incur future charges related to these actions, and have incurred charges of $255.1 million through December 31, 2014. It is possible that new information, changes in estimates, market conditions, continued dialogue with our customers and regulatory agencies, or other actions we may be required to undertake in furtherance of the strategy, may cause a need to modify or extend the existing initiatives or introduce new actions, and may result in substantial additional cash and non-cash charges.\nThis initiative includes the continued involvement of, and interaction with, the FDA and other regulatory agencies. While we have met with these agencies to gain alignment on the Device Strategy, there can be no assurance that these or other regulatory agencies will be satisfied with our actions or implementation of the strategy in the future, which could impact our ability to implement the Device Strategy in a timely manner or could prevent us from realizing all of the expected benefits of the Device Strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will not impose additional restrictions on the manufacture, distribution, sale or marketing of products in our device business, including our infusion pumps, administration sets or other device products.\nWe cannot be certain that we will have sufficient production capacity and appropriate and timely regulatory clearance to meet the demand or supply for replacement devices required to support the Device Strategy. Furthermore, our customers may elect not to continue using us as a supplier of infusion devices. Many of our pump customers also purchase a variety of other Medication Management products, including administration sets and other device products. If a significant number of our customers discontinue using our pump platform, our business and financial results may suffer, and sales of other products could be adversely impacted.\nFailure to effectively manage efforts or to realize the benefits under product development, collaboration, or other third-party agreements may harm our business and profitability.\nWe collaborate with other companies for the development, regulatory approval and clearance, manufacturing and marketing of new products in both the Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical and Medication Management product lines. We have entered into agreements relating to the long-term development and commercialization of proprietary and biosimilar products, which we view as an important long-term opportunity for our Specialty Injectable Pharmaceutical product line. We have entered into similar agreements for our Medication Management product line. Our ability to benefit from these arrangements will depend on our ability to manage successfully these arrangements and the performance of the other parties. We and the\nother parties may not work together efficiently, leading to higher-than-anticipated costs and delays in important activities under the arrangements. The other parties may not devote the resources required for the arrangement to be successful. These arrangements are often governed by complex agreements susceptible to differing interpretations by the parties, which may result in disputes, delays and missteps. The failure of these arrangements to achieve their objectives, or to achieve those objectives in a timely manner, could harm our sales, product development efforts and profitability.\nDuring the last few years, we made advances to suppliers such as for the purchase of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients or biosimilar products. These advances are unsecured. However, under some circumstances, the advances are refundable. We may not realize the expected benefits of those advances, or based upon the creditworthiness or other circumstances of the suppliers, may not be able to get a refund of the refundable payments, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nManufacturing and Supply\nThe manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, and if we or our suppliers encounter problems manufacturing, storing or distributing products, our business could suffer.\nManufacturing is highly exacting and complex due, in part, to strict regulatory requirements governing the manufacture of drugs and medical devices. We may experience problems with manufacturing, quality control, storage or distribution of our products. Those problems could include equipment breakdown or malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, good manufacturing quality concerns, problems with suppliers and the sourcing or delivery of raw materials and other necessary components, problems with software, labor difficulties, and natural disaster-related events or other environmental factors. If problems arise during the production, storage or distribution of a batch of product, that batch may have to be discarded. Problems also can lead to increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, failure to supply penalties, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches of products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recalls, corrective actions or product liability-related costs also may be incurred. Problems with respect to the manufacture, storage or distribution of products could materially disrupt our business and harm our sales and profitability.\nDuring the last few years, we voluntarily and temporarily shut down some of our production lines or slowed the release of some products to respond to quality issues, as described in the section captioned \"Certain Quality and Product Related Matters\" in \"Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this Report. Those disruptions adversely impacted our ability to manufacture and sell our products. If we experience any further significant interruptions of manufacturing or further slowdown in the release of products at any of our facilities, those interruptions could materially and adversely affect further our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nIssues with our quality systems and processes could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to further regulatory action and costly litigation, and cause a loss of confidence in us and our products.\nWe have been cited by the FDA and other agencies for various quality and product-related issues at our facilities, and our future performance will depend on our ability to address those issues with the FDA in a timely and effective manner. Resolution of these issues will require us to implement and improve our quality management program, and to train and manage effectively our employees with respect to quality management. We cannot give assurances as to the ultimate costs associated with resolving these matters, any associated penalties, whether regulatory agencies or customers will be satisfied with our efforts, or the expected date of resolution of these matters.\nUntil all of the matters are corrected, we may face:\n\u2022\npossible additional regulatory actions by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Such regulatory actions may result in additional corrective actions and costs, import and export bans or restrictions affecting product sales, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, seizures of violative products, consent decrees or injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution of products, monetary penalties, civil penalties, other restrictions on operations, and restrictions on new product approvals and clearances. We have experienced delays in product approvals and clearances at our facilities, and dependent upon the outcomes of these matters and potential further regulatory actions, further delays in, or denials of product approvals or clearances could continue to impact us;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity and customer reactions. Our inability to address quality or safety issues in an effective and timely manner also may cause negative publicity, and a loss of customer confidence, which may result in the loss of sales for existing and new products, the loss of market share for these products, changes to customer buying patterns, loss of\ncustomers, and failure to negotiate advantageous pricing and purchasing arrangements with GPOs. These quality matters have resulted in, and may further result in, lower customer service levels and resulting higher customer backorders, customer accommodations and penalties for failure to supply products; and\n\u2022\nproduction delays and additional costs. Due to the complexity and depth of the remediation activities, these matters have and may continue to adversely impact production, including causing further reduced production volumes, extended production downtime, inventory accumulation and/or inventory loss due to spoilage, excess, obsolescence or products failing to meet specifications and quality standards. These adverse impacts to production could lead to efforts to rationalize the product portfolio, evaluate non-strategic assets, and streamline the manufacturing footprint, which may result in certain asset impairments, customer accommodations, contract termination charges, restructuring, and other exit related charges. Thus, these quality matters have and may continue to lead to further remediation activities, including third-party oversight activities, product recalls, product remediation and life-cycle management programs, or other corrective actions. Additionally, these quality matters have adversely impacted, and may impact further, our Net sales and ability to market certain products in all segments.\nThese matters have impacted, and may continue to further impact, our cash flows and results of operations. A decrease in cash flows and/or earnings could further impact our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenant included in our revolving credit facility or could limit our flexibility in pursuing our current strategic investments, including our capacity expansion initiatives in India, modernization efforts at existing facilities, biosimilar research and development programs, global product portfolio expansion efforts, or any other programs we decide to pursue.\nOur continuous improvement activities have resulted, and may continue to result, in significant charges and cash expenditures. These activities may disrupt our business and may not result in the intended improvement or cost savings.\nOur strategy, in part, has been to improve margins and cash flow to drive sustained growth. In addition to cost-reduction initiatives, we have taken other actions to dispose of, or close, certain manufacturing, research and development, and other facilities. These actions have resulted in significant charges to our results of operations and cash expenditures.\nWe aim to achieve a culture of continuous improvement that will enhance our efficiency, effectiveness, and competitiveness and substantially improve our cost base. Continuous improvement activities could result in additional charges and cash expenditures, including capital expenditures and charges associated with our expansion in India of specialty injectable manufacturing capacity and modernizing and streamlining our existing portfolio of products and facilities. These expansion and modernization efforts may not be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all, and we may not realize the desired benefits of these efforts. If we do not realize the expected savings and benefits from our continuous improvement efforts, our profitability may be adversely impacted.\nCost-reduction and continuous improvement activities are complex, and if we do not successfully manage these activities, our operations and business could be disrupted, and we may incur more costs than anticipated. As a result, our sales, margins and profitability may be adversely impacted.\nWe and our suppliers are subject to various governmental regulations governing our products, and it could be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products. A failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA, and numerous other national, supranational, federal and state governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances to market a drug or medical device, particularly from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the U.S., can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals or clearances might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. To ensure ongoing customer safety, regulatory agencies such as the FDA may re-evaluate their current approval or clearance processes and may impose additional requirements. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may impose increased or enhanced regulatory inspections for domestic or foreign plants.\nThe FDA, along with other regulatory authorities around the world, has been experiencing a backlog of generic drug and medical device applications, which has delayed approvals and clearances of new products. These delays have become longer, and may continue to increase in the future. These delays can result in higher levels of unapproved inventory and increased costs due to excess and obsolescence exposures. In addition, we may incur additional costs in connection with new regulations covering user fees for generics, biosimilars or devices.\nWe and our collaborative partners and suppliers may not be able to remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements once we have obtained clearance or approval for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding cGMPs, product labeling, off-label marketing, advertising and post-marketing reporting, adverse event reports and field alerts. In addition, manufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off-label uses or inadequate disclosure of product related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. We and our partners or suppliers may be required by regulatory authorities, or we may determine on our own, to issue a safety alert, product recall, field correction or to temporarily cease production and sale of certain products in order to resolve manufacturing and product quality concerns. All of these events could harm our sales, margins and profitability in the affected periods and may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may face disruption to the product supply because some of our products are produced at a single facility.\nMany of our products are produced at a single manufacturing facility, which presents a risk of supply disruption if production at that facility is affected. If a disruption were to occur, we may be unable to satisfy customer orders on a timely basis, if at all. As a result, we could suffer loss of market share which may not be recaptured, failure to supply and other penalties, and our reputation could be harmed, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on third parties to supply raw materials and other components, and third-party finished goods. We may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials, which could limit our ability to manufacture or sell products on a timely basis and could harm our profitability.\nOur product manufacturing requires raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and electromechanical and other components that must meet stringent FDA and other regulatory requirements. Our efforts to diversify our sources of materials and components may be time consuming and costly to implement or not be successful. In some cases, these raw materials and other components are available from a limited number of suppliers. For example, we rely on:\n\u2022\ncertain proprietary components available exclusively from ICU Medical, including its CLAVE\u2122 and MicroCLAVE\u2122 connector products that are components of our infusion sets that represented approximately 11% of our 2014 global Net sales;\n\u2022\nOrion Corporation as our single source of active pharmaceutical ingredients for Precedex\u2122. In 2014, Precedex\u2122 represented approximately 9% of Hospira's global Net sales, and in the Americas, Precedex\u2122 represented approximately 13% of our SIP product line Net sales;\n\u2022\nsingle sources for the supply of some of the active pharmaceutical ingredient used in our products and for the supply of some of our finished products, including our Sapphire\u2122 pumps and administration sets;\n\u2022\nCelltrion and other third-party suppliers for the supply of drug substance and drug product for certain of our biosimilars; and\n\u2022\nsingle sources for some of the compounding materials, polyvinyl-chloride resin and laminate film components for our production of flexible bags that we use with our I.V. and premixed solutions, as well as rubber components that we use in the packaging of some of our injectable pharmaceuticals.\nOur joint venture, ZHOPL, manufactures a number of cytotoxic drugs for us. We share managerial control of the joint venture on an equal basis with the joint venture partner, Cadila. We may become involved in disputes with the joint venture partner, or encounter difficulties at the facility that could disrupt or halt the operations at the facility, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIdentifying alternative suppliers and obtaining approval to change or substitute a raw material or component, or the supplier of a finished product, raw material or component, can be time-consuming and expensive, as testing, validation and regulatory approval or clearance are often necessary. While we work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply, we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful. In the past, our business has experienced shortages in some of the raw materials and components of our products. Continuous supply of petroleum-based products, such as resin, is especially risky due to the limited number of capable suppliers, limited production capacity and the effect of natural disasters. If suppliers are unable to deliver sufficient quantities of these materials on a timely basis or if supply is otherwise disrupted, including by suppliers exiting the market, the manufacture and sale of our products may be disrupted, and our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of rising commodity prices.\nWe use commodities, such as platinum, resins and other petroleum-based materials, as raw materials in many of our products. Prices of oil, fuel, and other petroleum products also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Platinum, resins, other petroleum-based materials, oil, fuel, and other gas prices are volatile. If costs increase and we are unable to fully recover these costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions or hedging activities, we could experience lower margins and profitability.\nOur business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury.\nOur product development programs and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and toxic compounds. These programs and processes expose us to risks that an accidental contamination could lead to noncompliance with environmental laws, regulatory enforcement actions and claims for personal injury and property damage. In addition, we may be subject to clean-up obligations, damages and fines related to the discharge of hazardous materials, chemicals and toxic compounds at our properties and facilities, whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination.\nEnvironmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which our properties may be used or our business may be operated. For example, biologics manufacturing requires permits from government agencies for water supply and wastewater discharge. If we do not obtain appropriate permits, or the permits we receive do not provide for sufficient quantities of water and wastewater, we could incur significant costs and limits on our manufacturing volumes that could harm our business. Environmental laws provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Any costs or expenses relating to environmental matters may not be covered by insurance and, accordingly, may have a material and adverse impact on our business.\nMatters Affecting Customer Demand and Sales\nHealthcare reform legislation and other regulatory issues may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe PPACA makes various changes to the delivery of healthcare in the U.S. Those changes include reductions in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and could reduce the volume of medical procedures. These factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure and could result in lower reimbursements for our products. Other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of healthcare and could adversely affect aspects of our business. While the law is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the U.S., the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of our products remains uncertain.\nAdditionally, we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In the European Union and some other international markets, the government provides healthcare at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system.\nIf significant additional reforms are made to the U.S. healthcare system, or to the healthcare systems in other markets in which we operate, those reforms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.\nOur products and services are sold to hospitals and alternate site providers, such as clinics, home healthcare providers and long-term care facilities that receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payers, such as government programs, private insurance plans and managed-care programs. These third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Levels of reimbursement, if any, may be decreased in the future, and future healthcare reform legislation, regulations or changes to reimbursement policies of third party payers may otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nEconomic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our products. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which\nsupplemental rebates are not being paid. Managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts and, in some cases, to impose restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. These efforts may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nIn the EU and some other international markets, the government provides healthcare at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Many countries are reducing their public expenditures and we expect to see strong efforts to reduce healthcare costs in our international markets. In markets outside the U.S., our business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing as a result of the concentrated buying power of governments as principal customers and the use of bid-and-tender sales methods whereby we are required to submit a bid for the sale of our products. Our failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability in these markets.\nWe are subject to the cost-containment efforts of wholesalers and distributors that could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nWe rely on drug wholesalers to assist in the distribution of our generic injectable pharmaceutical products. While we have business arrangements in place with our major drug wholesalers, if we are required to pay fees, change existing discounts or payment terms, not contemplated by our existing arrangements, we will incur additional costs to distribute our products, which may adversely impact our profitability. Impacts may be magnified as GPO consolidation occurs, as discussed below.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain our GPO and IDN pricing agreements, sales of our products could decline.\nMany existing and potential customers for our products in the U.S. have combined to form GPOs and IDNs in an effort to lower costs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO's or an IDN's affiliated hospitals and other members. A small number of GPOs influence a majority of sales to our hospital customers in the U.S. Failure to negotiate market competitive pricing and purchasing arrangements could cause us to lose market share to our competitors and have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. The quality and related supply issues that have impacted our business over the last few years could adversely impact our ability to negotiate advantageous pricing or purchasing arrangements.\nWe have pricing agreements for certain products with the major GPOs in the U.S., including Amerinet, Inc.; HealthTrust Purchasing Group LP; MedAssets Supply Chain Systems, LLC; Novation, LLC; and Premier Healthcare Alliance, LP. It is important for us to continue to maintain pricing arrangements for certain products with major GPOs. In order to maintain these relationships, we must offer a reliable supply of high-quality, regulatory-compliant products. We also need to maintain a broad product line and be price-competitive. Several GPO contracts may be up for renewal or extension in a given year. Moreover, some of the agreements may be terminated on 60 or 90 days' notice, while others may not be terminated without breach until the end of their contracted term. If we are unable to renew or extend one or more of those contracts, or one or more of the contracts is terminated, and we cannot replace the lost business, our sales and profitability will decline. Major GPOs have been consolidating, and further consolidation may occur. The effect of consolidation is uncertain, and may impair our ability to contract with GPOs in the future.\nThe GPOs also have a variety of business relationships with our competitors and may decide to enter into pricing agreements for, or otherwise prefer, products other than our products. While GPOs negotiate incentives for members to purchase specified products from a given manufacturer or distributor, GPO pricing agreements allow customers to choose between the products covered by the arrangement and another manufacturer's products, whether or not purchased under a negotiated pricing agreement. As a result, we may face competition for our products even within the context of our GPO pricing agreements.\nChanges in the buying patterns of our customers could adversely affect our operating results.\nDuring 2014, sales through the four largest U.S. wholesalers and distributors that supply products to many end users accounted for approximately 44% of our global Net sales. Our profitability may be impacted by changes in the buying patterns of these wholesalers or any other major distributor. Their buying patterns may change as a result of end-use buyer purchasing decisions, end-use customer demand, pricing, or other factors, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe and our suppliers and customers are subject to various governmental regulations regarding the manner in which business is conducted, and a failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to sanctions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and foreign laws pertaining to foreign corrupt practices and healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims and off-label promotion laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in national, federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans' Administration health programs and health programs outside the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and financial condition.\nWe also are subject to disclosure requirements concerning the content of our products, including an SEC rule requiring disclosure of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Those requirements and associated reputational consequences may prompt companies to seek alternative sources of supply for those minerals, which may result in additional costs for those minerals as the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In our case, we may incur additional costs associated with possible changes to products, processes, regulatory approvals or clearances, or sources of supply if we cannot determine that the minerals originate from an acceptable source. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy any customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so, or are only able to do so at a higher price.\nFor a more detailed listing of the laws and regulations that significantly affect our business and operations, see section captioned \"Governmental Regulation and Other Matters\" above. Any adverse regulatory action, or action taken by us to maintain appropriate regulatory compliance, with respect to these laws and regulations could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and financial condition. Furthermore, an adverse regulatory action with respect to any of our products, operating procedures or manufacturing facilities could materially harm our reputation in the marketplace.\nFinancing and Liquidity Matters\nWe may require financing in the future for use in our operations, to make acquisitions or to make other investments, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe currently have outstanding $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes as of December 31, 2014. We also have a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in October 2016. We may need to incur additional debt in the future to finance acquisitions, for use in our operations, or to make other investments, including investments in certain quality and product related matters, continuous improvement activities, modernizing and streamlining activities, and product development. For a complete description of our long-term debt, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in \"Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report.\nOur ability to obtain financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on acceptable terms could be affected by our credit rating, other events that adversely impact our creditworthiness or a general tightening of credit availability in the capital markets. The inability to obtain adequate funds on acceptable terms, or terms that may include higher rates and additional restrictions, could limit our ability to pursue desired acquisitions or make other investments, or have other adverse consequences on our operations, which could negatively impact our business.\nAny previously mentioned, negative effects could cause a downgrade of our credit rating, which could affect our ability to obtain new financing and negatively impact our cost of financing and credit.\nOur existing unsecured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in pursuing our business plans.\nOur senior unsecured note indenture includes covenants limiting our ability, among other things, to incur secured indebtedness, enter into certain sale and lease transactions, and merge or consolidate with other companies. Our unsecured revolving credit facility has a number of restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens and subsidiary indebtedness, and a financial covenant limiting our leverage. The need to maintain compliance with the indenture and credit facility covenants could limit our ability to take actions that management believes are in our best interest. Amounts borrowed under the credit\nfacility, if any, are included in the leverage ratio covenant and may limit our availability for borrowings to less than $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2014, we had no amounts borrowed or otherwise outstanding under the credit facility. The availability of funds may be limited by financial covenants related to our debt and financial position. Further, the breach of a covenant, or the occurrence of certain other events specified in the indenture and the credit facility, would result in an event of default, in which case the lenders under the credit facility could elect not to make loans, or the holders of notes issued under the indenture or the lenders under the credit facility could accelerate the maturity of amounts payable thereunder.\nChallenging economic or business conditions could adversely affect our operations, including our liquidity and demand for our products.\nThe securities and credit markets have experienced volatility in the past, which in some cases, exerted negative pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit for certain companies. Our ability to access the credit and capital markets, and the related costs of borrowing, will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, the availability of credit and the strength of our credit rating. If our credit rating were to be downgraded for any reason, including the reasons described in these risk factors, our ability to obtain new financing could be negatively impacted, and our cost of borrowing could increase.\nLending institutions, including those associated with our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in October 2016, may suffer losses due to their lending and other financial relationships. As a result, lenders may become insolvent, which could affect the actual availability of credit under our revolving credit facility, or our ability to obtain other financing on equally favorable terms. Moreover, insurance companies and other financial institutions may suffer losses, which could affect the cost and availability of insurance coverage. If one or more of these events occurred, our liquidity may prove to be insufficient, costs of borrowing may increase, and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDemand for our products may decrease due to adverse economic conditions, resulting in the loss of jobs or healthcare coverage, thereby affecting an individual's ability to pay for healthcare. Adverse economic conditions also may increase our customers' cost-containment efforts, and affect our customers' solvency or their ability to obtain credit to finance their purchases of our products, which could reduce our revenue and cause a decrease in our profitability. These economic conditions also may adversely affect some of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce products.\nOther Matters\nThe loss of key personnel could harm our business.\nOur failure to hire or retain personnel with the right expertise and experience in disciplines that are critical to our business functions could adversely impact the execution of our business strategy. During the last few years, we made a number of changes to our senior management team to advance our strategic initiatives to improve quality and globally expand. The success of these initiatives and our business operations generally, will depend, to a significant extent, upon the experience, abilities and continued services of key management personnel. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel or maintain key relationships, or that the costs of retaining such personnel or maintaining such relationships will not materially increase.\nWe may acquire businesses and assets, license rights to technologies or products from third parties, form alliances, or dispose of businesses and assets, and those actions may not result in the expected benefits or may not be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all.\nIn executing our business strategy, we may acquire other businesses and assets, license rights to technologies or products from third parties, form alliances, or dispose of businesses and assets. We also may pursue strategic alliances to expand our product offerings and geographic presence. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition, license arrangement, strategic alliance, or disposition. Other companies, including those with substantially greater resources, may compete with us for opportunities. If we are successful in securing certain opportunities, the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. We may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business.\nWe may incur greater than expected costs in connection with these transactions if we encounter difficulties or issues not known to us at the time of entering into the transaction. In addition, we may enter markets in which we have no or limited prior experience. We could experience negative effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition- related charges.\nOur long-lived asset balances are significant, and a decline in the value of those assets may adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nThe values of our property and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and investments are significant and can be affected by various factors, such as increased competition, development discontinuation, delay in regulatory approval or clearance, product quality, changes in business strategies, decline in stock price, default risk, the impact of continuous improvement activities, disposition transactions, and business combinations. As a result of these factors or other events, we have impaired goodwill and certain intangible assets in the past and may have to impair further these assets or change estimated useful lives, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn addition, we regularly review our investments to determine when a significant event or change in circumstance has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. We consider numerous factors, including factors affecting the investee, the industry of the investee, general equity market trends and external economic factors, including, for example, foreign exchange rates. We also consider the length of time an investment's market value has been below carrying value and the near-term prospects for recovery to carrying value. Volatility in the global equity markets and other factors could adversely impact the fair value of our investments and, as a consequence, could result in a charge for an other than temporary decline in value, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe rely on the performance of our information technology systems, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business and performance.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to manage our finances, to manufacture, to enable compliance, and to market and sell our products. These systems are vulnerable to interruption or failure due to the age of certain systems, the introduction of viruses, malware, security breaches, fire, power loss, system malfunction, network outages and other events, which may be beyond our control. System interruptions or failures could impact our ability to manufacture our products or continue our business, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. In addition, a cyber-attack that bypasses our information technology security systems causing a security breach may lead to a material disruption of our information technology business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in an adverse business impact. The age of our information technology systems, as well as the level of our protection and business continuity or disaster recovery capability, varies from site to site, and there can be no guarantee that any such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be totally effective. Our capital investment levels in our information technology systems have increased over the last few years as we have been upgrading our networks, replacing certain older systems, improving backup and recovery capability and updating our technical security capability; however, these upgrades and improvements cannot guarantee a successful initial implementation, or \"go-live\", continuous operation of our information technology systems and network infrastructure, or protection against potential security breaches or against internal control weaknesses, which could negatively affect operations, customer confidence and profitability.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our outsourcing and third-party service provider arrangements.\nWe are increasingly dependent on third-party providers for some services, including some information technology, research and development, third-party manufacturing, human resource, and finance and accounting services. We may continue to increase our dependence on third-party providers for other services. The failure of these service providers to meet their obligations or the development of significant disagreements or other factors may materially disrupt our ongoing relationship with these providers or the services they provide, which could negatively affect operations.\nCompliance with domestic and international laws and regulations pertaining to the privacy and security of health information may be time consuming, difficult and costly.\nFailure to comply with domestic and international privacy and data security laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties. The costs of compliance with these laws, including protecting electronically stored information from cyber-attacks, and potential liability associated with failure to do so, could adversely affect our business, customer confidence, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. This act mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards\nto protect such information. In addition, many other government bodies have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than this act.\nWhile we expend resources to protect against cyber-attacks and security breaches, we may need to increase those expenditures in the future to continue to protect against potential security breaches or to address problems caused by those attacks or any breach of our safeguards. A party that is able to circumvent our security safeguards could, among other things, misappropriate or misuse sensitive or confidential information, user information or other proprietary information, cause significant interruptions in our operations and cause all or portions of our website to be unavailable. Further, any interruptions in the availability of our website could impair our ability to conduct our business, comply with regulations, and adversely impact our customers during the occurrence of any such incident.\nWe conduct operations outside of the U.S. and are subject to additional risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may cause our sales and profitability to decline.\nSales in markets outside the U.S. comprised approximately 27% of 2014 global Net sales. We anticipate that sales from outside the U.S. will continue to represent a significant portion of global Net sales. The additional risks associated with our operations outside the U.S. include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may affect the relative profitability of our products to those of our competitors as the U.S. dollar appreciates or depreciates relative to foreign currencies, and could affect the reported results of our operations;\n\u2022\nmultiple, and changing, legal or regulatory requirements, which may delay or deter our international product commercialization efforts;\n\u2022\nchanging governments or political parties, government unrest or political instability, which may delay or deter our international product commercialization efforts;\n\u2022\ndiffering local medical practices, product preferences and product requirements, or changing government reimbursement practices;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements or other controls or restrictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations or work stoppages, strikes, slow-downs or other forms of labor or union activity at our facilities or our suppliers' facilities;\n\u2022\ncomplying with laws and regulations that apply to international operations, including trade laws, anti-bribery laws. such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and anti-boycott laws;\n\u2022\nloss of business through government tenders that are held annually in many cases or through other government action;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, including legislative changes concerning taxation of income earned outside of the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe adverse impact on our operations from existing or future economic or political instability;\n\u2022\nthe adverse impact to our supply chain if the countries in which our partners operate, including Q Core (Israel) or Celltrion (South Korea), undergo economic or political distress\n\u2022\ndisruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic area, due to the location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities, customers, or lack of reliable transportation to move supplies and products to market, caused by natural disasters, political instability, public unrest or protests, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activities or military action, and the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; and\n\u2022\ndiminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.\nIn addition, we operate in many countries outside the U.S. through distributors or through a direct sales presence, and those countries may have been assigned a low Corruption Perception Index indicating a high level of corruption by Transparency International (a non-governmental agency that monitors and publicizes corporate and political corruption in international development). While we have programs in place to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations impacting us and our distributors, if it were determined that we or a distributor were not in compliance with certain laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and/or criminal liability and other material adverse effects. Our success in certain international markets will depend on the efforts and performance of us and our distributors. Moreover, if certain of those distributor relationships are unsuccessful, the costs to terminate such distributor relationship and/or to re-establish a customer base could adversely affect our profitability in certain regions. These risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to distribute and sell our products in markets outside the U.S. and could adversely affect our profitability.\nA portion of our, and our partners, manufacturing facilities are located in India and are subject to regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties arising in that country. These uncertainties create risks of disruption that could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.\nWe own, or rely upon, manufacturing operations in India, including:\n\u2022\na beta-lactam antibiotic manufacturing complex and pharmaceutical research and development facility located in IKKT outside of Chennai, India;\n\u2022\na penem and penicillin active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility located in Aurangabad, India and a research and development facility based in Chennai, India;\n\u2022\nthe Vizag specialty injectable manufacturing facility that is being constructed, with the first commercial production expected in 2015, dependent upon FDA approval, with production expected to increase over the course of the next several years;\n\u2022\nan unconsolidated joint venture with ZHOPL, which operates a manufacturing facility in a special economic zone outside of Ahmedabad, India that produces cytotoxic oncology molecules; and\n\u2022\nOrchid's continued supply of certain cephalosporin active pharmaceutical ingredients.\nVarious factors, periodic elections, general inflationary pressures on food and fuel prices, the availability of water, electricity and other utilities, and possible protest or civil unrest associated with government action, could involve significant changes in the social and business climate in India, with possible disruptions in Indian business and economic conditions and our Indian business operations. In addition, our financial performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in India, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates, inflation and taxation policies, as well as social stability and political, economic or diplomatic developments affecting India in the future. In particular, India has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years, but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead. These challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education. Our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified employees and develop and operate our facilities could be adversely affected if India does not successfully meet these challenges.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties, including criminal and civil fines, potential loss of export licenses, possible suspension of the ability to do business with the federal government, denial of government reimbursement for products and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. We operate in jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, distributors or other agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are involved in various lawsuits and proceedings that could negatively affect our business.\nWe are involved in various claims and legal proceedings, including, in some instances, related to when we operated as part of Abbott. In some instances, these claims and proceedings could preclude the continued sale and marketing of our products or otherwise adversely affect operations, profitability or liquidity. These matters could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability or financial condition. In addition, there could be an increase in the scope of these matters, and there could be additional lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations in the future. In light of these uncertainties, we cannot assure that the outcome of these matters will not result in charges in excess of any established accruals.\nIn the past, we have been involved in investigations and lawsuits related to improper marketing and pricing practices with respect to certain Medicare and Medicaid reimbursable products. We could be subject to these investigations or lawsuits again in the future, and these matters could have an adverse impact on us.\nWe may incur product liability losses, or become subject to other lawsuits related to our business, and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.\nOur business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of drugs, medical devices and its other products. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts, product recalls or corrective actions, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.\nWe are responsible for all liabilities, including liabilities for claims and lawsuits, related to our business, whether they arose before or after the spin-off, other than certain liabilities relating to allegations that we engaged in improper marketing and pricing practices in connection with federal, state or private reimbursement for our products prior to spin-off. As part of our risk management policy, we often carry third-party product liability insurance coverage, which includes a substantial retention or deductible providing that we will not receive insurance proceeds until the losses incurred exceed the amount of that retention or deductible. To the extent that any losses are within these retentions or deductibles, we are responsible for the administration and payment of these losses. Product liability or other claims that exceed our applicable insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nChanges in the funded status or costs of our pension or other post-retirement benefit plans could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe funded status of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are subject to developments and changes in actuarial and other related assumptions. Decreases in the valuation of plan assets, particularly with respect to equity securities, and a change in the actual rate of return on plan assets can result in significant changes to the expected return on plan assets in the following year. As a consequence, significant changes to the expected return could result in higher funding requirements and net periodic benefit costs. In addition, changes in assumptions, such as discount rates, mortality rates, healthcare cost trend rates and other factors, may lead to significant increases in the value of these obligations. Assumption changes also could affect the reported funded status of our plans and, could result in higher funding requirements and net periodic benefit costs. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIncome taxes can have an unpredictable effect on our results of operations and result in greater-than-anticipated liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in a multiple jurisdictions and our tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities. Because our income tax expense for any period depends heavily on the mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions during that period, which is inherently uncertain, our income tax expense and reported net income may fluctuate significantly and may be materially different than forecasted. In addition, operations in certain jurisdictions have and may continue to operate at a loss, requiring management estimates of expected utilizations of the related net operating loss deferred tax assets in future years. Due to tax losses in India,Australia and Brazil, the deferred tax assets have undergone assessment of available evidence for future realization. Should these operations fail to reach appropriate levels of profitability, these estimates could change periodically, requiring us to establish valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets, which could be significant and increase tax expense. Moreover, changes in or interpretations of tax laws and regulations (including laws related to the remittance of foreign earnings), changes in investments in foreign countries with favorable tax rates, and settlements of federal, state and foreign tax audits, may affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe are the beneficiary of tax exemptions in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S., where a portion of our income is earned. These tax exemptions have a significant impact on reducing our overall effective tax rate. If we are unable to obtain or\nmaintain these tax exemptions, our future profitability may be reduced. Significant legislative changes have been proposed in the U.S. that could impact the actual benefit of income earned in lower taxed jurisdictions; however, we cannot determine if these proposed changes will be enacted. There are individual and multi-country enhanced reporting requirements being debated (such as the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative) that may influence tax policy and audits in a currently undetermined manner. Any changes in laws or governmental policies can materially affect the future availability or the benefit of current tax exemptions.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are established when, despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable, positions taken by us are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority's determination of the positions. Although we believe our tax provisions and related asset and liability balances are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recognized in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nFinancial considerations may lead governments to look toward additional revenue sources, including increased taxes and fees, which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nGovernmental bodies may face revenue shortfalls as a result of, among other things, diminished economic activity, greater program expenses and extraordinary aid programs, which may cause them to consider additional revenue sources, including additional or restructured taxes and additional fees. Those taxes or fees, if imposed, could adversely affect our results of operation and cash flows.\nThe stock market can be volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results and other factors, could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. Moreover, our sales and operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to our quarterly or annual results, annual projections and the impact of these risk factors on our operating results or financial position.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Merger with Pfizer\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including governmental, regulatory and stockholder approvals as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\nOn February 5, 2015, Hospira entered into the Merger Agreement with Pfizer and Merger Sub, under which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Hospira, with Hospira continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain customary conditions. A number of the conditions are not within Hospira\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s control, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the Merger. These conditions include, among other things, (i) approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Hospira common stock entitled to vote on the Merger, (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, as well as the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the antitrust laws of several other jurisdictions, including the European Union, and (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect on Hospira, as defined in the Merger Agreement. Hospira cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise. If the Merger does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearances, or if another event occurs that delays or prevents the Merger, such delay or failure to complete the Merger may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect Hospira\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and, to the extent that the current price of Hospira\u2019s common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed, the price per share for Hospira\u2019s common stock.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, Hospira may, under certain circumstances, be obligated to pay a termination fee to, and/or reimburse certain expenses of, Pfizer.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, Hospira would be required to pay a termination fee of $500 million to Pfizer. In certain other circumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated, Hospira would be required\nto reimburse Pfizer for $20 million in Pfizer\u2019s expenses (which payment would be credited against any subsequent termination fee ultimately payable by Hospira). If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the expense reimbursement and the termination fee Hospira may be required to pay, if any, under the Merger Agreement may require Hospira to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other matters. For these and other reasons, a failed Merger could materially and adversely affect Hospira\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and the price per share of Hospira\u2019s common stock.\nThe Merger Agreement limits Hospira\u2019s ability to pursue alternative transactions to the proposed Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement prohibits Hospira from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging, knowingly inducing or entering into discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding alternative acquisition proposals. This prohibition limits Hospira\u2019s ability to affirmatively seek offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior to the pending Merger, although Hospira is permitted, subject to compliance with certain procedures specified in the Merger Agreement, to respond to certain unsolicited proposals from third parties. If Hospira receives an unsolicited proposal from a third party that Hospira\u2019s board of directors determines is a superior proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, Hospira is contractually obligated to pay a termination fee of $500 million to Pfizer. This termination fee may make it less likely that a third party will make an alternative acquisition proposal.\nWhile the Merger is pending, Hospira is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect its operations and the future of its business or result in a loss of employees.\nThe Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of Hospira\u2019s business prior to the completion of the Merger, generally requiring Hospira to conduct its business in the ordinary course and subjecting Hospira to a variety of specified limitations absent Pfizer\u2019s prior written consent. Hospira may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement may delay or prevent it from or limit its ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if Hospira\u2019s management believes they may be advisable. The pendency of the Merger may also divert management\u2019s attention and Hospira\u2019s resources from ongoing business and operations. Hospira\u2019s employees, customers and suppliers may have uncertainties about the effects of the Merger. In connection with the pending Merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other parties with whom Hospira has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with Hospira as a result of the Merger. Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Hospira following completion of the Merger, which may materially adversely affect Hospira\u2019s ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact Hospira\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the market price of Hospira\u2019s common stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed.", "PERMNO": 90110, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "HSP"}
