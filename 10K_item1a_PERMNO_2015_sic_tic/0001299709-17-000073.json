{"cik": "1299709", "company": "BofI Holding, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-08-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our performance.\nOur results of operations depend to a great extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and leases and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. We are exposed to interest rate risk because our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not react uniformly or concurrently to changes in interest rates, as the two have different time periods for adjustment and can be tied to different measures of rates. Interest rates are sensitive to factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the FRB. The monetary policies of the FRB, implemented through open market operations and regulation of the discount rate and reserve requirements, affect prevailing interest rates. Loan and lease originations and repayment rates tend to increase with declining interest rates and decrease with rising interest rates. On the deposit side, increasing interest rates generally lead to interest rate increases on our deposit accounts. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the monetary policy of the FRB has been to reduce market interest rates to historical lows, but prevailing interest rates have begun to increase and the financial markets are anticipating further increases in interest rates by the FRB. We manage the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities; however a large or rapid increase in market interest rates would likely have an adverse impact on our net interest income and a decrease in our refinancing business and related fee income, and could cause an increase in delinquencies and non-performing loans and leases in our adjustable-rate loans. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the value of our loans and leases, investments and other interest-rate sensitive assets and our ability to realize gains on the sale or resolution of these assets.\nA significant economic downturn could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and leases and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions, including factors such as the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income and consumer spending. While the national economy and most regions have improved since the financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent economic recession, we continue to operate in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth. A return or continuation of recessionary conditions or negative events in the housing markets, including significant and continuing home price declines and increased delinquencies and foreclosures, would adversely affect our mortgage and construction loans and result in increased asset write-downs. In addition, poor economic conditions, including continued high unemployment in the United States, have contributed to increased volatility in the financial and capital markets and diminished expectations for the U.S. economy. While we are continuing to take steps to decrease and limit our exposure to problem loans, we nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets. Declines in real estate values, an economic downturn or continued high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan and lease delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in laws, regulation or oversight may increase our costs and adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to oversight, regulation and examination by federal and/or state governmental authorities under various laws, regulations and policies, which impose requirements or restrictions on our operations, capitalization, payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged and interest rates paid on deposits. We must also comply with federal anti-money laundering, tax withholding and reporting, and consumer protection\nstatutes and regulations. A considerable amount of management time and resources is devoted to oversight of, and development and implementation of controls and procedures relating to, compliance with these laws, regulations and policies.\nThe laws, regulation and supervisory policies are subject to regular modification and change. New or amended laws, rules and regulations could impact our operations, increase our capital requirements or substantially restrict our growth and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably by making compliance much more difficult or expensive, restricting our ability to originate or sell loans, or further restricting the amount of interest or other charges or fees earned on loans or other products. In addition, further regulation could increase the assessment rate we are required to pay to the FDIC, adversely affecting our earnings. It is very difficult to predict future changes in regulation or the competitive impact that any such changes would have on our business. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes. Other changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including subjecting us to additional costs, limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, and increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our common stock.\nIn addition, members of Congress and elected officials have from time to time suggested the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction for federal income tax purposes, either entirely or in part, based on borrower income, type of loan or principal amount. The competitive advantage of tax deductible interest, when compared with alternative sources of financing, could be eliminated or seriously impaired by this type of governmental action. The Bank originates and holds a large amount of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. The reduction or elimination of these tax benefits, and other changes in federal income tax policies, could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the Bank\u2019s loan products and pricing and liquidity of the mortgage securities which the Bank holds.\nPolicies and regulations enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may negatively impact our residential mortgage loan business and compliance risk.\nOur consumer business, including our mortgage and deposit businesses, may be adversely affected by the policies enacted or regulations adopted by the CFPB which under the Dodd-Frank Act has broad rule-making authority over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB is in the process of reshaping consumer financial protection laws through rule-making and enforcement against unfair, deceptive and abusive acts or practices. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The prohibition on \u201cabusive\u201d acts or practices is being clarified each year by CFPB enforcement actions and opinions from courts and administrative proceedings. In January 2014, a series of final rules issued by the CFPB to implement provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act related to mortgage origination and servicing went into effect and caused an increase in the cost of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans. While it is difficult to quantify any future increases in our regulatory compliance burden, the costs associated with regulatory compliance, including the need to hire additional compliance personnel, may continue to increase.\nThe impact of Basel III is uncertain.\nBasel III sets forth more robust global regulatory standards on capital adequacy, qualifying capital instruments, leverage ratios, market liquidity risk, and stress testing, which may be stricter than standards currently in place. The phase-in period for Basel III begins January 1, 2015 and ends on January 1, 2019. The implementation of these new standards could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position and future earnings due to, among other things, the increased Tier 1 capital ratio requirements that will be implemented.\nRisks Relating to Mortgage Loans and Mortgage-Backed Securities\nDeclining real estate values, particularly in California, could reduce the value of our loan and lease portfolio and impair our profitability and financial condition.\nThe majority of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. At June 30, 2017, approximately 69.6% of our mortgage portfolio was secured by real estate located in California. In recent years, there has been significant volatility in real estate values in California and in some cases the collateral for our real estate loans has become less valuable. If real estate values decrease or more of our borrowers experience financial difficulties, we will experience increased charge-offs, as the proceeds resulting from foreclosure may be significantly lower than the amounts outstanding on such loans. In addition, declining real estate values frequently accompany periods of economic downturn or recession and increasing unemployment, all of which can lead to lower demand for mortgage loans of the types we originate. A decline of real estate values or decline of the credit position of our borrowers in California would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our mortgage loans are unseasoned and defaults on such loans would harm our business.\nAt June 30, 2017, our multifamily residential loans were $1,619.4 million or 28.5% of our mortgage loans and our commercial real estate loans were $162.7 million, or 2.9% of our mortgage loans. The payment on such loans is typically dependent on the cash flows generated by the projects, which are affected by the supply and demand for multifamily residential units and commercial property within the relative market. If the market for multifamily residential units and commercial property experiences a decline in demand, multifamily and commercial borrowers may suffer losses on their projects and be unable to repay their loans. If residential housing values were to decline and nationwide unemployment were to increase, we are likely to experience increases in the level of our non-performing loans and foreclosed and repossessed vehicles in future periods.\nWe could recognize other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio.\nWe analyze securities held in our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary can involve difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer, market conditions, and the value of any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in future periods reducing future earnings and capital levels.\nA decrease in the mortgage buying activity of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae or a failure by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac to satisfy their obligations with respect to their RMBS could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the last three fiscal years we have sold over $1,267.3 million of residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae and, as of June 30, 2017, approximately 10.0% of our securities portfolio consisted of RMBS issued or guaranteed by these GSEs. Since 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, acting as conservator. The United States government may enact structural changes to one or more of the GSEs, including privatization, consolidation and/or a reduction in the ability of GSEs to purchase mortgage loans or guarantee mortgage obligations. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorships will end, or what associated changes (if any) may be made to the structure, mandate or overall business practices of either of the GSEs. Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to exist in their current form and whether they will continue to meet their obligations with respect to their RMBS. A substantial reduction in mortgage purchasing activity by the GSEs could result in a material decrease in the availability of residential mortgage loans and the number of qualified borrowers, which in turn may lead to increased volatility in the residential housing market, including a decrease in demand for residential housing and a corresponding drop in the value of real property that secures current residential mortgage loans, as well as a significant increase in interest rates. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, which would result in a decrease in mortgage loan revenues and a corresponding decrease in non-interest income. Any decision to change the structure, mandate or overall business practices of the GSEs and/or the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private mortgage loan markets, or any failure by the GSEs to satisfy their obligations with respect to their RMBS, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Company\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses, particularly in growing areas of lending such as commercial and industrial (\u201cC&I\u201d) is not sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses, our earnings, capital adequacy and overall financial condition may suffer materially.\nOur loans are generally secured by single family, multifamily and commercial real estate properties, each initially having a fair market value generally greater than the amount of the loan secured. Although our loans and leases are typically secured, the risk of default, generally due to a borrower\u2019s inability to make scheduled payments on his or her loan, is an inherent risk of the banking business. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers, the value of the real estate serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans and our loss history. Defaults by borrowers could result in losses that exceed our loan and lease loss reserves. We have originated or purchased many of our loans and leases recently, so we do not have sufficient repayment experience to be certain whether the established allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate. We may have to establish a larger allowance for loan and lease losses in the future if, in our judgment, it becomes necessary. Any increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses would increase our expenses and consequently may adversely affect our profitability, capital adequacy and overall financial condition.\nIn addition, we continue to increase our emphasis on non-residential lending, particularly in C&I lending, and these types of loans and leases are expected to comprise a larger portion of our originations and loan and lease portfolio in future periods. To the extent that we fail to adequately address the risks associated with C&I lending, we may experience increases in levels of non-performing loans and leases and be forced to take additional loan and lease loss reserves, which would adversely affect our net interest income and capital levels and reduce our profitability. For further information about our C&I lending business, please refer to \u201cBusiness - Asset Origination and Fee Income Businesses - Commercial Real Estate Secured and Commercial Lending.\u201d\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates, and judgments, include methodologies to value our securities, evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairment and estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses. These methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates, and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize the expected future benefits of our relationship with H&R Block, Inc, and our relationship exposes us to additional credit risk from new products.\nOn August 31, 2015, we acquired approximately $419 million in deposits from H&R Block Bank and its parent company, H&R Block, Inc. (\u201cH&R Block\u201d), and entered into a Program Management Agreement (\u201cPMA\u201d) and related agreements under which we agreed to provide H&R Block-branded financial services products and services. The success of our relationship with H&R Block depends upon, among other things, our ability to operate the PMA and H&R Block\u2019s desire and ability to offer financial services products to customers after the closing date. Our obligations under the PMA are subject to risks that operational and regulatory procedures imposed by H&R Block under the PMA may change. Also, under the terms of the PMA there are no minimum transaction levels and the number of transactions that are processed may be more or less than expected due to business changes by H&R Block, regulatory changes or changes due to competition for H&R Block\u2019s products. If we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives or if H&R Block limits, eliminates or fails to realize the expected volumes for one or more of the financial services products described in the PMA, the future benefits of our relationship with H&R Block may not be realized fully. Our relationship with H&R Block also subjects us to new forms of consumer credit risk, including risk of loss from lines of credit and interest-free tax refund advance loans that we make to customers of EFS and H&R Block.\nIn addition, the relationship with H&R Block requires substantial resources and effort from our management. The maintenance of integrated processes and other disruptions resulting from the relationship may disrupt our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in our standards, controls, procedures or policies. In addition, difficulties in maintaining the integrated functions could harm our reputation with customers. For further information about the transaction with H&R Block, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - H&R Block Bank Deposit Acquisition.\u201d\nAs a public company, we face the risk of shareholder lawsuits and other related or unrelated litigation, particularly if we experience declines in the price of our common stock. We have been named as a party to purported class action and derivative lawsuits, and we may be named in additional litigation, all of which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses.\nAs described in detail below in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings,\u201d putative class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, alleging, among other things, that our Company, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose the wrongful conduct that is alleged by a former employee in a complaint, and that as a result the Company\u2019s statements regarding its internal controls, and portions of its financial statements, were false and misleading. Derivative lawsuits have also been filed against our management arising from the same events, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, mismanagement, abuse of control and unjust enrichment. Regardless of the merits, the expense of defending such litigation may have a substantial impact if our insurance carriers fail to cover the full cost of the litigation, and the time required to defend the actions could divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. An unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company and its management deny any wrongdoing and are vigorously defending the referenced lawsuits.\nWe may seek additional capital but it may not be available when it is needed and limit our ability to execute our strategic plan. In addition, raising additional equity capital would dilute existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests and may cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support the growth of our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we elect to raise additional capital for other reasons. We may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, which could dilute existing shareholders\u2019 interests in the Company.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance on our ability to raise additional capital if needed or if it can be raised on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to us, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, raising equity capital will have a dilutive effect on the equity interests of our existing shareholders and may cause our stock price to decline.\nAccess to adequate funding cannot be assured.\nWe have significant sources of liquidity as a result of our federal thrift structure, including deposits, brokered deposits, the FHLB, repurchase lending facilities, and the FRB discount window. We rely primarily upon deposits and FHLB advances. Our ability to attract deposits could be negatively impacted by a public perception of our financial prospects or by increased deposit rates available at troubled institutions suffering from shortfalls in liquidity. The FHLB is subject to regulation and other factors beyond our control. These factors may adversely affect the availability and pricing of advances to members such as the Bank. Selected sources of liquidity may become unavailable to the Bank if it were to no longer be considered \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d\nOur inability to manage our growth or deploy assets profitably could harm our business and decrease our overall profitability, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur assets and deposit base have grown substantially in recent years, and we anticipate that we will continue to grow over time, perhaps significantly. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to manage multiple aspects of the business simultaneously, including among other things: (i) improve existing and implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls; (ii) maintain effective credit scoring and underwriting guidelines; (iii) maintain sufficient levels of regulatory capital; and (iv) expand our employee base and train and manage this growing employee base. In addition, acquiring other banks, asset pools or deposits may involve risks such as exposure to potential asset quality issues, disruption to our normal business activities and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention due to integration and conversion efforts. If we are unable to manage growth effectively or execute integration efforts properly, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of growth and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may not be able to sustain past levels of profitability as we grow, and our past levels of profitability should not be considered a guarantee or indicator of future success. If we are not able to maintain our levels of profitability by deploying growth in our deposits in profitable assets or investments, our net interest margin and overall level of profitability will decrease and our stock price may decline.\nWe face strong competition for customers and may not succeed in implementing our business strategy.\nOur business strategy depends on our ability to remain competitive. There is strong competition for customers from existing banks and other types of financial institutions, including those that use the Internet as a medium for banking transactions or as an advertising platform. Our competitors include large, publicly-traded, Internet-based banks, as well as smaller Internet-based banks; \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d banks, including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online banking; and traditional banking institutions such as thrifts, finance companies, credit unions and mortgage banks. Some of these competitors have been in business for a long time and have name recognition and an established customer base. Most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and personnel resources. In order to compete profitably, we may need to reduce the rates we offer on loans and leases and investments and increase the rates we offer on deposits, which actions may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo remain competitive, we believe we must successfully implement our business strategy. Our success depends on, among other things:\n\u2022\nHaving a large and increasing number of customers who use our bank for their banking needs;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract, hire and retain key personnel as our business grows;\n\u2022\nOur ability to secure additional capital as needed;\n\u2022\nThe relevance of our products and services to customer needs and demands and the rate at which we and our competitors introduce or modify new products and services;\n\u2022\nOur ability to offer products and services with fewer employees than competitors;\n\u2022\nThe satisfaction of our customers with our customer service;\n\u2022\nEase of use of our websites; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to provide a secure and stable technology platform for financial services that provides us with reliable and effective operational, financial and information systems.\nIf we are unable to implement our business strategy, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our customer base.\nThe brand identities that we have developed will significantly contribute to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \u201cBofI Federal Bank\u201d brands (including our other trade styles and trade names such as apartmentbank.com) is critical to expanding our customer base. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry for our \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d competitors in the internet-based banking market. Our brands could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data privacy and security issues, service outages, and product malfunctions. If we fail to maintain and enhance our \u201cBofI Federal Bank\u201d brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nA natural disaster, especially in California, could harm our business.\nWe are based in San Diego, California, and approximately 69.6% of our mortgage loan portfolio was secured by real estate located in California at June 30, 2017. In addition, some of our computer systems that operate our internet websites and their back-up systems are located in San Diego, California. Historically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters. Therefore, we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods and mudslides. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our websites, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and leases and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan and lease portfolio, which is comprised substantially of real estate loans. Uninsured or under-insured disasters may reduce borrowers\u2019 ability to repay mortgage loans. Disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans, impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans. Although we have implemented several back-up systems and protections (and maintain standard business interruption insurance), these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. The occurrence of natural disasters in California could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in large part on the continuing efforts of a few individuals. If we are unable to retain these key personnel or attract, hire and retain others to oversee and manage our company, our business could suffer.\nOur success depends substantially on the skill and abilities of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Gregory Garrabrants, our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew J. Micheletti, and other employees that perform multiple functions that might otherwise be performed by separate individuals at larger banks. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or other key employees, whether through termination of employment, disability or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our ability to grow and manage our growth depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled executive, technical, managerial, sales, marketing, customer service and professional personnel. The implementation of our business plan and our future success will depend on such qualified personnel. Competition for such employees is intense, and there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liability with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTechnology Risks in our Online Business\nWe depend on third-party service providers for our core banking technology, and interruptions in or terminations of their services could materially impair the quality of our services.\nWe rely substantially upon third-party service providers for our core banking technology and to protect us from bank system failures or disruptions. This reliance may mean that we will not be able to resolve operational problems internally or on a timely basis, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction or long-term disruption of our operations. Our operations also depend upon our ability to replace a third-party service provider if it experiences difficulties that interrupt operations or if an essential third-party service terminates. If these service arrangements are terminated for any reason without an immediately available substitute arrangement, our operations may be severely interrupted or delayed. If such interruption or delay were to continue for a substantial period of time, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from using our products and services.\nGenerally speaking, concerns have been expressed about whether internet-based products and services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information of our customers or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and results of operations. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are internet-based, the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing and will continue to increase. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our customers\u2019 data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we add more customers and expand the number of internet-based products and services we offer.\nWe have risks of systems failure and security risks, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentity theft.\u201d\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us and others could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. This is true of both our internally developed systems and the systems of our third-party service providers. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunication failure or similar catastrophic events.\nAny damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations or security breaches such as hacking or identity theft could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of customers to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and, as a result, we could lose customers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our customers. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to our website, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of customers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our customers to access the internet and our website.
