{"cik": "1020214", "company": "CERUS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. There may be additional risks faced by our business. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we, our customers, and our suppliers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease, or COVID-19, was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization, or the WHO, declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic, and any potential future significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population that results in a widespread health crisis, could continue to adversely affect the broader economies, financial markets, our ability to make meaningful progress with many of our development programs and result in disruption and impact on existing and prospective customers.\nAlthough we are currently deemed to be a critical business by national, state and local governments, out of an abundance of caution for our employees and to minimize the spread of COVID-19, we have put restrictions on employee travel and working from our facilities in the United States and Europe. These restrictions have negatively impacted and disrupted at least certain aspects of our business and delayed some of our timelines. Further, restrictions on our ability to travel, stay-at-home orders and other similar restrictions on our business have limited our ability to support our global and domestic operations, including providing training and technical support, resulting in disruptions in our sales and marketing efforts. Moreover, the pandemic has severely restricted the level of economic activity in affected areas and may continue to adversely impact demand for, and sales of, our products. We have deferred certain of our customer events and many planned trade shows have been cancelled and we may further defer or cancel additional customer, employee or industry events, or our participation in such events, in the future. In addition, many new customers and prospective customers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and their ability to implement new technologies, including INTERCEPT, has and may continue to be negatively impacted. Furthermore, our ability to gain access to customers during the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to be negatively impacted and may limit our ability to prepare customers and sell product. Conversely, during this pandemic, certain existing, new and prospective customers have and may continue to ask for increased utilization of our products beyond what was forecast, and we may not be able to timely satisfy this increase in demand. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has in the past and may continue to limit access to hospitals which could disrupt blood center interaction with those hospitals and the introduction of the INTERCEPT Blood System. In addition, should hospital access be restricted, our ability to sell pathogen reduced cryoprecipitate fibrinogen complex, or PRCFC, directly to hospitals may be impaired. Customers\nwhose operations have been impacted may have difficulty paying timely, may ask for price reductions or may delay or cancel public tenders. In addition, while our suppliers have initiated business continuity plans with minimal expected disruption to our supply, we cannot be certain that any prolonged, intensified or worsened effect from the crisis would not negatively impact our supply chain. All of the aforementioned could adversely affect our sales, operating results and overall financial performance.\nOur primary manufacturing partner for our disposable kits is located in France where restrictive government and private enterprise measures were implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure employee safety and comply with local requirements for social distancing, we understand that Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, or Fresenius, had to reconfigure production workflow to safely produce INTERCEPT disposable kits. A renewed spike in the pandemic in France could increase employee absenteeism at the manufacturing site and is a potential risk that could negatively impact production, the magnitude of which depends, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on their ability to conduct business in the ordinary course.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, and an effective rollout of a vaccination program. In the event one or more of our laboratory employees is exposed to or becomes ill with COVID-19, our ability to complete research and development activities may be impaired and dependent studies and trials may be delayed as a result. We cannot guarantee that the resumption of these activities will be expeditious or that the resulting delays will not be for an extended period of time. Furthermore, if key deployment and/or technical service personnel are exposed to or become ill with COVID-19, our ability to effectively support our customers on a timely basis could be negatively impacted and our ability to support customers looking to implement INTERCEPT may be impaired.\nIn addition, while the potential economic impact brought by COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, it has significantly disrupted global financial markets, and may limit our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to perform many clinical trials, studies and activities, including those covered by our agreement with BARDA.\nBeyond the commercial impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our operations, our clinical and development programs have been adversely affected. Our ongoing and anticipated clinical trials, the post-approval platelet studies, as well as studies to support label expansion for our platelet program in the U.S. have been delayed because of COVID-19. Many hospital sites suspended enrollment and have not yet resumed enrollment while others are proceeding at a reduced capacity. Further delays may occur in the future if patient enrollment sites need to pause participation in our clinical trials and studies. Should the COVID-19 pandemic persist, continue to worsen, or resurface at locations where we conduct studies or clinical trials, our ability to commence and complete any contemplated studies may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, should we be unable to deploy personnel, derive a benefit from fixed study costs or generate data from clinical sites and studies reimbursed under our contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, our cash flows would be negatively impacted and/or we may have to initiate furloughs and layoffs, which would likely prove disruptive to our management and operations. This in turn would impair our ability to recommence and complete studies if and when the COVID-19 crisis subsides.\nIn addition, access to federal contracts is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government, including the U.S. Congress. The general economic environment and uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with tight federal budgets, has led to a general decline in the amount available for government funding. As the clinical studies and other activities supported by our BARDA contract get further delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must rely on modifications and extensions to the BARDA agreement to fund the completion of those activities. If we are unable to get approval for those modifications or extensions, we may need to fund the completion of those studies and activities ourselves. If BARDA were to eliminate, reduce or delay funding under our agreement, or if we are otherwise required to self-fund the activities covered by the BARDA agreement, this could have a significant negative impact on the programs associated with such funding, including the discontinuation of those programs, and could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and cash flows. In addition, certain activities expected to be performed under our BARDA agreement have been significantly delayed. Should BARDA disallow extensions of time to perform the contemplated activities, we would have to either fund the completion of the activities ourselves or discontinue pursuit. Furthermore, while BARDA has provided funding for and has indicated a potential for future funding for many activities associated with combating COVID-19, the availability and focus for any BARDA funding will likely be finite and may require us to compete with other technologies, both similar and disparate.\nWe depend substantially upon the commercial success of the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitation in the United States, or U.S., and our inability to successfully commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System in the U.S. would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources on the development of the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitation for the U.S. market. As a result, our business is substantially dependent on our ability to\nsuccessfully commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System in the U.S. in a timely manner. In September 2019, the FDA issued a final guidance document, \u201cBacterial Risk Control Strategies for Blood Collection Establishments and Transfusion Services to Enhance the Safety and Availability of Platelets for Transfusion,\u201d or Final Guidance Document. The guidance document required all blood collection facilities to comply with the options available under the guidance document, which includes the INTERCEPT Blood System, for all platelet collections, no later than 18 months from the issuance date. However, in December 2020, the FDA updated the Final Guidance Document and extended the compliance grace period until October 1, 2021. Although the INTERCEPT Blood System is one of the options available to U.S. blood centers for compliance, we cannot predict if U.S. customers will adopt INTERCEPT over other options or at what levels. In addition, if we are not successful in expanding the label claims for our platelet kits in the U.S., including permitting storage of INTERCEPT-treated platelet units for up to seven days and approval of our processing set for triple dose platelet collections, U.S. blood centers or their hospital customers may choose alternative products in order to comply with the guidance document. Significant product revenue from customers in the U.S. may not occur timely, if at all, until we have been able to successfully implement the platelet and plasma systems and demonstrate that they are economical, safe and efficacious for potential customers. Similar to our experience in foreign jurisdictions, some potential customers in the U.S. have chosen to first validate our technology or conduct other pre-adoption activities prior to purchasing or deciding whether to adopt the INTERCEPT Blood System for commercial use, which may never occur. Further, new hospital customers of any of our blood center customers will need to go through the administrative process of generating internal tracking codes to integrate INTERCEPT-treated products into their inventories, which may further delay customer adoption in the U.S. If the COVID-19 crisis persists or continues to worsen, customers may not be able to implement new technologies such as INTERCEPT and may instead choose to utilize other allowable methods with which they have more familiarity. Moreover, if hospitals are not able or willing to allow our employees to gain access to their facility or personnel, our ability to market and commercialize PRCFC directly to hospitals may be impaired and our results of operations negatively impacted. If we are not successful in achieving market adoption of the INTERCEPT Blood System in the U.S., we may never generate substantial product revenue, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitation in the U.S. will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022\nadequately respond in the event of potential increased U.S. customer demand resulting from the implementation of the FDA final guidance document;\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance and generate product sales through execution of sales agreements on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nenter into and maintain sufficient manufacturing arrangements for the U.S. market with our third-party suppliers;\n\u2022\ncreate market demand for the INTERCEPT Blood System through our education, marketing and sales activities;\n\u2022\nhire, train, deploy, support and maintain a qualified U.S.-based commercial organization and field sales force;\n\u2022\nexpand the labeled indications of use for the INTERCEPT Blood System and/or design, develop, test and obtain regulatory approval for new product configurations;\n\u2022\ncomply with requirements established by the FDA, including post-marketing requirements and label restrictions; and\n\u2022\ncomply with other U.S. healthcare regulatory requirements.\nIn addition to the other risks described herein, our ability to successfully commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitation in the U.S. is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to:\n\u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on customers, hospitals, suppliers and our employees;\n\u2022\nthe highly concentrated U.S. blood collection market that is dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations;\n\u2022\navailability of donors;\n\u2022\nregulatory and licensing requirements, including the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, licensing process that U.S.-based blood centers are required to follow in order to obtain and maintain the required site-specific licenses to engage in interstate transport of blood components processed using the INTERCEPT Blood System;\n\u2022\nchanged or increased regulatory restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nthe amount available for reimbursement pursuant to codes we have obtained under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, and pricing for outpatient use of INTERCEPT-treated blood components;\n\u2022\nany supply or manufacturing problems or delays arising with any of our suppliers, many of whom are our sole suppliers for the particular product or component they manufacture, the ability of our suppliers to maintain FDA approval to manufacture the INTERCEPT Blood System and to comply with FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements;\n\u2022\ndependency upon any third-party manufacturer that supplies products required by blood centers to process and store blood components consistent with our approved specifications and claims, including but not limited to, apheresis collection devices, disposable blood bags and reagents, and platelet additive solution, or PAS;\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare laws and policy, including changes in requirements for blood product coverage by U.S. federal healthcare programs; and\n\u2022\nacceptance of the INTERCEPT Blood System as safe, effective and economical from the broad constituencies involved in the healthcare system.\nIn addition to the above, our ability to successfully commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System in the U.S. is dependent on our ability to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. For example, we are aware of an expired U.S. patent that had been held by a third-party that covered methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products. We have reviewed the patent and believe there exist substantial questions concerning its validity. We cannot be certain, however, that a court would hold the patent not infringed by our platelet or plasma systems. In this regard, whether or not we have infringed this patent will not be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets the patent in the context of litigation and the risk of an infringement claim will remain until the statute of limitations to bring an infringement claim has expired. In the event that we are found to have infringed any valid claim of this patent, we may, among other things, be required to pay damages.\nThese and the other risks described below related to the commercialization of the INTERCEPT Blood System could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets and plasma in the U.S.\nThe INTERCEPT Blood System may not achieve broad market adoption.\nIn order to increase market adoption of the INTERCEPT Blood System and to increase market demand, we must address issues and concerns from broad constituencies involved in the healthcare system, from blood centers to patients, transfusing physicians, key opinion leaders, hospitals, private and public sector payors, regulatory bodies and public health authorities. We may be unable to demonstrate to these constituencies that the INTERCEPT Blood System is safe, effective and economical or that the benefits of using the INTERCEPT Blood System products justify their cost and/or outweigh their risks.\nThe use of the platelet system results in some processing loss of platelets. As a result, customers or prospective customers may adopt alternative solutions if they perceive that:\n\u2022\nthe loss of platelets leads to increased costs, or the perception of increased costs for our customers,\n\u2022\nthe use of our product in any way constrains the availability of platelets to platelet loss,\n\u2022\nour customers or prospective customers believe that the loss of platelets reduces the efficacy of the transfusable unit, or\n\u2022\nour process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens, prospective customers may not adopt our platelet system.\nAdditionally, existing customers may not believe they can justify any perceived operational change or inefficiency either generally or in conjunction with a blood component availability shortage. Customers that attempt to optimize collections from individual donors in order to increase the volume of transfusable units from those collections may experience a less optimized yield as a result of adopting INTERCEPT as compared to collecting conventional platelet products. Certain studies have indicated that transfusion of conventionally prepared platelets may yield higher post-transfusion platelet counts (according to a measurement called \u201ccorrected count increment\u201d) and may be more effective than transfusion of INTERCEPT-treated platelets. Although certain other studies demonstrate that INTERCEPT-treated platelets retain therapeutic function comparable to conventional platelets, prospective customers may choose not to adopt our platelet system due to considerations relating to corrected count increment, efficacy or other factors.\nThe INTERCEPT Blood System does not inactivate all known pathogens, and the inability of the INTERCEPT Blood System to inactivate certain pathogens may limit its market adoption. For example, our products have not been demonstrated to be effective in the reduction of certain non-lipid-enveloped viruses, including hepatitis A and E viruses, and human parvovirus B-19, due to the biology of these viruses. Although we have shown high levels of reduction of a broad spectrum of lipid-enveloped viruses, our inability to inactivate, or limit reduction, of certain non-lipid-enveloped viruses may negatively impact the decision to adopt by prospective customers. Similarly, although our products have been demonstrated to effectively inactivate spore-forming bacteria, our\nproducts have not been shown to be effective in reducing bacterial spores once formed. In addition, our products do not inactivate prions since prions do not contain nucleic acid. While transmission of prions has not been a major problem in blood transfusions, and we are not aware of any competing products that inactivate prions, the inability to inactivate prions may limit market adoption of our products. While we have data supporting INTERCEPT\u2019s ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, both coronaviruses, we have only limited data supporting INTERCEPT\u2019s efficacy in inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19). Although we have several other studies underway to study the pathogen inactivation efficacy of INTERCEPT against SARS-CoV-2, we cannot assure you that the results of these studies will be successful. Furthermore, due to limitations of detective tests, we cannot exclude that a sufficient quantity of pathogen or pathogens beyond the detection limits may still be present in active form, which could present a risk of infection to the transfused patient. Should INTERCEPT-treated components contain detectable levels of pathogens after treatment, the efficacy of INTERCEPT may be called into question, whether or not any remaining pathogens are the result of INTERCEPT\u2019s efficacy or other factors. Such uncertainties may limit the market adoption of our products.\nWe have conducted studies of our products in both in vitro and in vivo environments using well-established tests that are accepted by regulatory bodies. When an in vitro test was not generally available or not well-established, we conducted in vivo studies in mammalian models to predict human responses. Although we have no reason to believe that the in vitro and in vivo studies are not predictive of actual results in humans, we cannot be certain that the results of these in vitro and in vivo studies accurately predict the actual results in humans in all cases. In addition, strains of infectious agents in living donors may be different from those strains commercially available or for which we have tested and for which we have received approval of the inactivation claims for our products. To the extent that actual results in human patients differ, commercially available or tested strains prove to be different, or customers or potential customers perceive that actual results differ from the results of our in vitro or in vivo testing, market acceptance of our products may be negatively impacted.\nIf customers experience operational or technical problems with the use of INTERCEPT Blood System products, market acceptance may be reduced or delayed. For example, if adverse events arise from incomplete reduction of pathogens, improper processing or user error, or if testing of INTERCEPT-treated blood samples fails to reliably confirm pathogen reduction, whether or not directly attributable to the INTERCEPT Blood System, customers may refrain from purchasing our products. Furthermore, should customers communicate operational problems or suspected product failure, we will need to investigate and report imputability to the relevant regulatory authorities in a timely manner. We or others may be required to file reports on such complaints or product failure before we have the ability to obtain conclusive data as to imputability which may cause concern with existing and prospective customers or regulators. Should customers feel that INTERCEPT treatment has a negative impact on the number of transfusable platelet units able to be manufactured from available donors, our ability to convince a blood center to treat increasing proportions of its platelet units may be negatively impacted. Moreover, there is a risk that further studies that we or others may conduct, including the post-approval studies we are required to conduct as a condition to the FDA approval of the platelet system, will show results inconsistent with previous studies. Should this happen, potential customers may delay or choose not to adopt our products and existing customers may cease use of our products. In addition, some hospitals may decide to purchase and transfuse both INTERCEPT-treated blood components and conventional blood components, including PRCFC which we have no experience selling directly to hospitals. Managing such a dual inventory of blood products may be challenging, and hospitals may need to amend their product labels and inventory management systems before being able to move forward with INTERCEPT. This may require coordination between hospital suppliers, blood centers, or us, which in turn may cause delay in market adoption. Further, in certain markets, potential customers may require us to develop, sell, and support data management application software for their operations before they would consider adopting INTERCEPT. Such software development efforts may be costly or we may be unsuccessful in developing a data management application that would be broadly accepted. Developing, maintaining and supporting software can be time consuming, costly and may require resources and skill sets that we do not possess. Failure to do so may limit market adoption in geographies where we commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System, including the U.S. In addition, customers may require certain changes to our products for any number of reasons. Complying with such requests may prove costly, and may create complexities surrounding the manufacturing of the kits, compliance with regulatory authorities, blood center usage, or inventory management. Conversely, failure to comply with such requests from customers may result in damage to our relationship or the potential loss of customer business.\nMarket adoption of our products is affected by blood center and healthcare facility budgets and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from governments, managed care payors, such as insurance companies, and/or other third parties. In many jurisdictions, due to the structure of the blood products industry, we have little control over budget and reimbursement discussions, which generally occur between blood centers, healthcare facilities such as hospitals, and national or regional ministries of health and private payors. Even if a particular blood center is prepared to adopt the INTERCEPT Blood System, its hospital customers may not accept or may not have the budget to purchase INTERCEPT-treated blood products. We understand that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitals are consolidating, are laying off workers or are filing for bankruptcy protection, and other hospitals may have such significant budget shortages that they unable to afford pathogen-reduced blood components. In addition, some hospitals are seeing such a high influx of COVID-19 cases, that, regardless of whether they have sufficient staff to handle the high case load, they may be unable or unwilling to allocate sufficient resources to implement a new technology such as INTERCEPT. Since blood centers would likely not eliminate the practice of screening donors or testing blood for some pathogens prior to transfusion, even after\nimplementing our products, some blood centers may not be able to identify enough cost offsets or hospital pricing increases to afford to purchase our products. Budgetary concerns may be further exacerbated by economic legislation in certain countries and by proposals by legislators at both the federal and, in some cases, state levels, regulators, healthcare facilities and third-party payors to keep healthcare costs down, which may limit the adoption of new technologies, including our products. In some jurisdictions, commercial use of our products may not be covered by governmental or commercial third-party payors for health care services and may never be covered. Even if we received national reimbursement for our products, we may not be able to convince blood center customers to change their operating practices and produce INTERCEPT-treated platelets and plasma. In the U.S., we obtained HCPCS reimbursement codes for INTERCEPT-treated platelets and plasma in the outpatient setting in 2015, but have not obtained HCPCS reimbursement codes for our products, PRCFC or the derivative, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced, which were approved in November 2020. Our ability to successfully market and sell our PRCFC or the derivative, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced may be dependent on our ability to obtain a separate reimbursement code and pricing for such products. The costs and expenses incurred by the blood center related to donor blood are typically included in the price that the blood center charges a hospital for a unit of blood. Even after blood components treated with our products are approved for reimbursement by governmental or commercial third-party payors, including under HCPCS codes, the costs and expenses related to use of the INTERCEPT Blood System will not be directly reimbursed, but instead may be incorporated within the reimbursement structure for medical procedures and/or products at the site of patient care. Governmental or third-party payors may change reimbursement rates, year over year, or in reaction to submitted claims for reimbursement of costs and expenses related to blood components treated with INTERCEPT. The current HCPCS codes utilized by U.S. hospitals describe only the transfusion of traditional plasma cryoprecipitate, which is produced under much less labor-intensive processing and manipulation by blood centers. There is no current HCPCS code that accurately identifies the transfusion of highly processed plasma cryoprecipitation for fibrinogen deficiency, such as our product, PRCFC. Though we have applied for a specific HCPCS code for transfusion of highly processed plasma cryoprecipitation for fibrinogen deficiency, we cannot guarantee that we will receive approval for such HCPCS codes or that reimbursement under an approved HCPCS codes will be in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of our products to our hospital customers. If the costs to the hospital for INTERCEPT processed blood products cannot be easily, readily, or fully incorporated into the existing reimbursement structure, or if reimbursement rates are insufficient or decreased in any given year for blood components treated with INTERCEPT, hospital billing and/or reimbursement for these products could be impacted, thus negatively impacting hospitals\u2019 acceptance and uptake of our products.\nThe market for the INTERCEPT Blood System is highly concentrated with few customers, including often-dominant regional or national blood collection entities. Even where our products receive regulatory approval and reimbursement is available, failure to effectively market, promote, distribute, price or sell our products to any of these customers could significantly delay or even diminish potential product revenue in those geographies. Moreover, the market for pathogen reduction systems in the U.S. is highly concentrated and dominated by a small number of blood collection organizations. In the U.S., the American Red Cross represents the largest single portion of the blood collection market. We cannot guarantee the long-term volume or timing of commercial purchases that the American Red Cross may make, if any, under our agreement. Our ability to gain significant market penetration in the U.S. is largely dependent on utilization of INTERCEPT and distribution of INTERCEPT-treated blood components by the American Red Cross. The American Red Cross is a large organization and broad-based utilization of INTERCEPT and distribution of INTERCEPT-treated products may be concentrated in a limited number of centers or may occur slowly, if at all. Conversely, given the large relative size of the American Red Cross, should they deploy the technology rapidly, our resources may be inadequate to fulfill the American Red Cross\u2019 and other customers\u2019 demands, which could result in a loss of product revenues or customer contracts, or both. In September 2019, the FDA issued a final guidance document, \u201cBacterial Risk Control Strategies for Blood Collection Establishments and Transfusion Services to Enhance the Safety and Availability of Platelets for Transfusion.\u201d The guidance document requires all blood collection facilities to comply with the options available under the guidance document, which includes the INTERCEPT Blood System, for all platelet collections, no later than October 1, 2021. Should the American Red Cross or a large number of blood centers wait until the end of the compliance period to produce INTERCEPT at sufficient volumes to comply with the guidance document, we may not have sufficient resources or product available to allow customers to timely and successfully implement INTERCEPT before the end of the compliance grace period. Should we be unable to manufacture INTERCEPT in sufficient quantities in a timely manner, or have adequate resources to assist customer with implementing the INTERCEPT Blood System, U.S. blood centers may be forced to use alternate options allowed by the guidance document, which could permanently impact our ability to convert those blood centers to INTERCEPT users. Hospitals in regions seeing a surge in COVID-19 cases may disallow access to their sites or personnel which will delay our ability to market and sell our products, including PRCFC. Also, if the COVID-19 crisis persists or continues to worsen, customers may not be able to implement new technologies such as INTERCEPT and may instead choose to utilize other allowable methods with which they have more familiarity. Similarly, if we are not successful in expanding the label claims for our platelet kits in the U.S., including permitting storage of INTERCEPT-treated platelet units for up to seven days and approval of our processing set for triple dose collections, U.S. blood centers or their hospital customers may choose alternative products in order to comply with the FDA guidance document. In many countries in Western Europe and in Japan, various national blood transfusion services or Red Cross organizations collect, store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations\u2019 blood and blood components supply. In Europe, the largest markets for our products are in Germany, France, and England. In Germany, decisions on product adoption are made on a regional or even blood center-by-blood center basis, but depend on both local approvals and centralized regulatory approvals from the Paul Ehrlich Institute, or PEI. Obtaining these approvals requires support and coordination from local blood centers, and may take a\nsignificant period of time to obtain, if ever. Product specifications that receive marketing authorization from the PEI may differ from product specifications that have been adopted in other territories where we rely on CE Mark approval, thereby necessitating market specific modifications to the commercial product, which may not be economical or technically feasible for us. Following the inclusion of pathogen-inactivated platelets for national reimbursement by the German Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System as of January 1, 2018, German customers who do not currently have an approved marketing authorization application, or MAA, will first need to obtain one before using our product. The review period for a new MAA can be up to 12 months or longer following submission and we cannot assure that any of the potential German customers submitting a new MAA will obtain it. Without broad approvals of MAA applications obtained by potential German customers, our ability to successfully commercialize INTERCEPT in Germany will be negatively impacted, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial results. In addition, the reimbursement awarded to INTERCEPT in Germany may not be considered by German blood centers as attractive enough to implement pathogen reduction or cover the entirety of their blood center platelet collections which may in turn limit the market acceptance in Germany. Similar to the U.S., German blood centers will need to successfully market and sell to their hospital customers and understand and assist with the steps that are needed at the hospital level in Germany to administer pathogen-reduced platelets. Should German blood centers not adequately market and sell or assist their hospital customers or if hospitals object, or are slow implementing the steps needed to procure and administer pathogen reduced platelets, our market in Germany many be limited or be slow to realize acceptance.\nIn July 2017, we entered into new agreements with \u00c9tablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang, or EFS, to supply illuminators and platelet and plasma disposable kits. The agreement for supply of illuminators and platelet disposable kits provided for a base term of two years, with two options for EFS to extend for one year each, both of which have been exercised by EFS. In January 2020, we entered into a new agreement with EFS to supply plasma disposable kits and maintenance services for illuminators for a base term of two years, with two options for EFS to extend for one year each. While EFS has standardized production of its platelets using the INTERCEPT Blood System, we cannot provide any assurance that the national deployment of INTERCEPT to treat platelets in France will be sustainable or that we will be able to secure any subsequent contracts with EFS or that the terms, including the pricing or committed volumes, if any, of any future contract will be equivalent or superior to the terms under our current contract. If we are unable to continue to successfully support EFS\u2019 national adoption of the INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets, EFS\u2019 use of the INTERCEPT Blood System for Plasma or the final commercial terms of any subsequent contract for platelet or plasma disposable kits are less favorable than the terms under our existing contracts, our financial results may be adversely impacted. Our contracts with EFS do not contain purchase volume commitments and as such, we may see variability in purchase levels or an altogether cessation. We understand that use of blood components may at times be negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting deferrals of elective procedures requiring use of blood components, including those treated with INTERCEPT. This in turn, may negatively impact our potential revenues from existing and prospective customers.\nIn addition, we understand that EFS is inspecting and testing samples of each lot that they purchase from us prior to accepting the products shipped to fulfill orders. We have little insight into the time to test, testing conditions or ultimate results. Other customers may require similar conditions of purchase. Testing may have a negative impact on our ability to recognize product revenue either due to the time it takes to test and approve the release of a shipment or if the customer experiences problems with testing or if testing results are outside of the customer acceptance criteria.\nIn Japan, the Japanese Red Cross controls a significant majority of blood transfusions and exerts a high degree of influence on the adoption and use of blood safety measures in Japan. The Japanese Red Cross has been reviewing preclinical and clinical data on pathogen reduction of blood over a number of years and has yet to make a formal determination to adopt any pathogen reduction approach. We also understand that the Japanese Red Cross had begun formal evaluation of a competing technology. Before the Japanese Red Cross considers our products, we understand that we may need to commit to making certain product configuration changes, which are currently under development but may not be economically or technologically feasible for us to accomplish.\nSignificant increases in demand may occur given the concentrated nature of many of the largest potential customers and the potential for a mandate by public health agencies to adopt pathogen reduction technologies. Should those customers choose to adopt and standardize their production on the INTERCEPT Blood System or be required to adopt and standardize on the INTERCEPT Blood System, our ability to meet associated increases in demand may be constrained due to a variety of factors, including supply issues, manufacturing disruptions, availability of disposable kits manufactured from the obsolete plastic materials in jurisdictions that have not approved the use of alternate plastics for our disposable kits, or other obsolescence of parts, among others. If we encounter such disruptions or supply shortages, we may have to allocate available products to customers, which could negatively impact our business and reputation or cause those customers to look for alternatives to the INTERCEPT Blood System.\nWe may be unable to develop and maintain an effective and qualified U.S. based commercial organization or educate blood centers, clinicians and hospital personnel. As a result, we may not be able to successfully educate the market on the value of pathogen reduction or commercialize our products in the U.S.\nOur ability to generate significant product revenue from our platelet and plasma systems depends in part on our ability to achieve market acceptance of, and to otherwise effectively market, our platelet, plasma, and cryoprecipitation systems in the U.S. Even if we\nare able to achieve market acceptance in the U.S. or newly commercialized markets, we have provided and may provide adoption incentives in the future which may negatively impact our reported sales. We currently plan to sell PRCFC directly to hospitals. This is a new business model with which we have no experience. This new business model may contemplate the replacement of expired PRCFC with new units of PRCFC at no cost or a reduced cost. We have no experience selling products under this consignment model. The introduction of these new models of doing business require extensive training of our personnel and may lengthen the time it takes for this business unit to be fully operational. In addition, we may also sell the disposable kits related to the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation directly to blood centers for the manufacture of PRCFC for their own account. As a result, we may be directly competing with these blood centers for the sale of PRCFC. These blood centers have more experience and existing contracts with the hospitals, and may be able to offer synergies that we cannot, each of which may negatively impact our ability to compete successfully. Successfully commercializing our products in the U.S. has taken more time than anticipated and has required us to continue to invest in commercialization efforts to build and maintain relationships, additional routine-use data and trust from the industry. We continue to need to attract, retain, train and support sales, marketing and scientific and hospital affairs personnel and other commercial talent. For example, we still need to attract and retain hospital affairs professionals to help educate hospitals and physicians on our products, clinical trial history and publications. Hospital affairs professionals are highly educated and trained professionals and the hiring and employment market for hospital affairs professionals is highly competitive. As such, we need to commit significant additional management and other resources in order to maintain and potentially expand our hospital affairs team and sales and marketing functions. We may be unable to develop and maintain adequate hospital affairs, sales and marketing capabilities for the U.S. market and we also may not be able to devote sufficient resources to the advertising, promotion and sales efforts for the platelet and plasma systems in the U.S. As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, we may continue to have difficulties recruiting, on-boarding and training new field-based personnel, or we may choose to defer recruiting for certain positions due to the ongoing pandemic. In addition, our field personnel, if available, may be unable to gain access to blood center or hospital accounts, which may limit our ability to effectively sell our products. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective and qualified U.S. based commercial organization in a timely manner or at all, we may fail to realize the full sales potential of our commercial products in the U.S. In addition, in November 2020, we obtained approval for PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced, both of which are created through the use of the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation, or the cryoprecipitation system. The cryoprecipitation system also uses treated plasma components from the INTERCEPT Blood System for plasma. We may seek additional approval of unique biological products created by use of the INTERCEPT Blood System in the future and may choose to sell these treated end products directly to hospitals using our commercial organization. While we are working on implementing the infrastructure we believe will be necessary to market the PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced directly to hospitals, we have no experience selling biological end products directly to hospitals, which may cause a distraction for our commercial organization or require us to supplement our commercial organization with new personnel with experience in selling products directly to hospitals. We may fail to develop or maintain an effective and qualified commercial infrastructure to serve these customers. Further, our blood center customers may view the sale of biologics directly to hospitals as a competitive threat, which may adversely affect our customer relationships, could negatively impact our business prospects and could result in loss of business and revenue. In addition, we may never achieve market acceptance and adoption of our newly approved PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced by U.S. hospitals to generate product revenue sufficient to cover its costs.\nWe may be liable and we may need to withdraw our products from the market if our products harm people. We may be liable if an accident occurs in our controlled use of hazardous materials. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to offset losses we may incur.\nWe are exposed to potential liability risks inherent in the testing and marketing of medical devices. In addition, the commercialization of our PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced will also expose us to risks inherent in the marketing and sale of biologic products. We may be liable if any of our products cause injury, illness or death. Although we complete preclinical and clinical safety testing prior to marketing our products, there may be harmful effects caused by our products that we are unable to identify in preclinical or clinical testing. In particular, unforeseen, rare reactions or adverse side effects related to long-term use of our products may not be observed until the products are in widespread commercial use. Because of the limited duration and number of patients receiving blood components treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System products in clinical trials, it is possible that harmful effects of our products not observed in preclinical and clinical testing could be discovered after a marketing approval has been received. For example, in cases where we have obtained regulatory approval for our products, we have demonstrated pathogen reduction to specified levels based on well-established tests. However, there is no way to determine, after treatment by our products, whether our products have completely inactivated all of the pathogens that may be present in blood components. In addition, even if our products inactivate all pathogens in a blood product, it is often difficult to determine if pathogens are introduced after treatment with INTERCEPT due to blood center or hospital mishandling, shipping or other possibilities. There is also no way to determine whether any residual amount of a pathogen remains in the blood component treated by our products and there is no way to exclude that such residual amount would be enough to cause disease in the transfused patient or was a result of a potential defect or lack of efficacy of our products. For ethical reasons, we cannot conduct human testing to determine whether an individual who receives a transfusion of a blood component containing a pathogen that was inactivated using the INTERCEPT Blood System might show positive results if tested for an antibody against that pathogen. While we believe, based on the clinical experience of our scientists, that\nthe level of inactivated pathogens would likely be too small to induce a detectable antibody response in diagnostic tests, we cannot exclude that a transfused patient might show positive results if tested for an antibody against that pathogen. We could be subject to a claim from a patient that tests positive, even though that patient did not contract a disease. In addition, should personnel at clinical study sites or ultimately, potential customers, be harmed by amustaline, or believe they have been or could be harmed by amustaline, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to provide coverage for any related potential liabilities. Amustaline is considered a potent chemical and is the active compound of our red blood cell system.\nWe maintain product liability insurance, but do not know whether the insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including certain hazardous chemicals, radioactive materials and infectious pathogens, such as HIV and hepatitis viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials are adequate and comply with regulatory requirements, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for any damages that result.\nA recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products that leads to corrective actions, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nAny adverse event involving our products, whether in the U.S. or abroad could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nUnder the FDA\u2019s reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health. We may initiate a product recall under our own initiative if any material deficiency in our product is found, such as a component failure, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues, or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons. Repeated product malfunctions or deficiencies may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall. We are required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all company-initiated corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the applicable reporting regulations. If we do not adequately address problems associated with our products, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our sales as well as face significant adverse publicity or regulatory consequences, which could harm our business, including our ability to market our products in the future. Such events could impair our ability to supply our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nIf our competitors develop products superior to ours, market their products more effectively than we market our products, or receive regulatory approval before our products, our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated.\nWe expect our products will continue to encounter significant competition. The INTERCEPT Blood System products compete with other approaches to blood safety currently in use and may compete with future products that may be developed by others. Our success will depend in part on our ability to respond quickly to customer and prospective customer needs, successfully receive and maintain regulatory approvals, and adapt to medical and technological changes brought about by the development and introduction of new products. Competitors\u2019 products or technologies may make our products obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, competitors or potential competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. If competitive pathogen reduction products experience significant problems, customers and potential customers may question the safety and efficacy of all pathogen reduction technologies, including the INTERCEPT Blood System. Such questions and concerns may impair our ability to market and sell the INTERCEPT Blood System.\nSeveral companies have, or are developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for products that will directly compete with or reduce the market for our pathogen reduction systems. A number of companies are specifically focusing on alternative strategies for pathogen reduction in platelets and plasma.\nThese alternative strategies may be more effective in reducing certain types of pathogens from blood products, including certain non-lipid-enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis A and E viruses or human parvovirus B-19, which our products have not demonstrated an ability to inactivate have not demonstrated a high level of inactivation. While studies have demonstrated that our products can effectively inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens in blood components, market adoption of our products may be reduced if\ncustomers determine that competitors\u2019 products inactivate a broader range of pathogens that are of particular interest to the transfusion medicine community. In addition, customers and prospective customers may believe that our competitors\u2019 products are safer, more cost effective or easier to implement and incorporate into existing blood processing procedures than INTERCEPT Blood System products.\nIn Europe, several companies are developing or selling commercial pathogen reduction systems or services. Octapharma AG, or Octapharma, has FDA approval to sell treated fresh frozen plasma for certain indications and is currently commercially available. In addition, we understand that Octapharma received approval to sell fresh frozen plasma in France. Octapharma\u2019s entry into the French market may pose a competitive threat to other pathogen reduced plasmas, including INTERCEPT and may in turn limit the potential market available to us in France. Should Octapharma enter into exclusive agreements with key customers, our plasma system may encounter market resistance and we will have a more limited market into which we can sell. Terumo BCT\u2019s platelet, plasma or whole blood pathogen reduction product may be viewed as favorable by the Japanese Red Cross. Terumo Corporation is a large Japan-based, multinational corporation with more mature products and relationships than we have. Our ability to commercialize our products in certain markets, particularly in Japan, may be negatively affected by Terumo\u2019s resources and their pre-existing relationships with regulators and customers. Should Terumo BCT\u2019s product be approved for use and commercialized in Japan, we would likely directly compete with them and we believe we would likely need to either establish operations in Japan or partner with a local Japanese company.\nMacoPharma SA, or Macopharma, has received CE Mark for a UVC-based product for pathogen reduced platelets. Macopharma has recently completed a Phase 3 clinical trial in Germany for expanded approvals. The data from this trial has not yet been made publicly available. Terumo BCT, a subsidiary of Terumo Corporation, has developed a pathogen reduction system for blood products and has been issued CE Marks for its system for both platelets and plasma and received Swissmedic approval for platelets. We further understand that Terumo BCT developed a pathogen reduction system for whole blood and received a Class II CE Mark. Each of these companies\u2019 products may offer competitive advantages over our INTERCEPT Blood System. In addition, these companies are multinational corporations with more mature products and relationships than we have. Our ability to commercialize our products in certain markets may be negatively affected by their larger resources and their pre-existing relationships with regulators and customers.\nGrifols S.A., Kedrion Biopharma, and other companies have or are developing competing products and may also offer and sell other blood-banking products and services. New methods of testing whole blood for specific pathogens have been approved by the FDA and in Europe, as have tests for bacteria in platelets. Other companies are marketing rapid, point-of-care bacterial tests, and developing synthetic blood product substitutes and products to stimulate the growth of platelets. Development and commercialization of any of these or other related technologies could limit the potential market for our products as would a mandate of any competing technology other than INTERCEPT.\nOur INTERCEPT blood system for cryoprecipitation competes with traditional cryoprecipitate, a by-product of thawing frozen plasma and with human-derived fibrinogen concentrates. While we believe that PRCFC has many advantages over competitors, traditional cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrates are well established within hospital use. Hospitals may not perceive the advantage of PRCFC over the competing products, we may be ineffective in selling biological agents directly to hospitals or be unable to convince hospitals of the economic or patient advantages relative to the competitors. Further, competitors may have more experience marketing and selling products directly to hospitals. In addition, regulatory agencies may mandate use of competing products which would limit our ability to sell our products in those markets.\nOur platelet and plasma products and product candidates are not compatible with some collection, production and storage methods or combinations thereof. Further, blood centers using INTERCEPT must have access to those certain devices, blood bags, assays or platelet additive solutions that are compatible with our products.\nThe equipment and materials used to collect platelets vary by manufacturer and by geographic region. Platelets may be collected from a single donor by apheresis using an automated collection machine. Apheresis devices currently used in the U.S. and European markets differ, among other characteristics, in their ability to collect platelets in reduced volumes of plasma. Platelet collection device manufacturers may need to modify device collection parameters or software before a prospective customer could use INTERCEPT. If these manufacturers are not cooperative or are resistant to assist their customers or do not assist with making such modifications, the potential market for our products may be limited. Platelet concentrates may also be prepared from whole blood by pooling together platelets from multiple donors. There are two commonly used methods for preparing whole blood platelets: the buffy coat method, which is used extensively in Europe, and the pooled random donor method, which is used in the U.S. Our platelet system is designed to work with platelets collected and stored in storage solutions, called InterSol and SSP+, and for platelets suspended in 100% plasma. Fresenius is the exclusive manufacturer of InterSol and MacoPharma of SSP+, both widely-used Platelet Additive Solutions, or PASs. Many of our customers and prospective customers use InterSol or SSP+ in connection with INTERCEPT treatment. Similarly, some of our customers combine multiple platelet or plasma components before treating the combined product with INTERCEPT.\nThere are several third-party manufacturers of pooling sets to allow for such combination. Our customers\u2019 ability to use our INTERCEPT products may be impaired should manufacturers of those products not provide access to their products allowing for the combination of multiple components or if such manufacturers experience a shortage of their products or encounter defects with their products. In addition, we do not yet know what impact, if any, the new European Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, may have on these suppliers or their products. Should manufacturers of collection devices, compatible assays and blood bags, pooling sets or platelet additive solutions fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval, including the MDR, experience unexpected production disruption, or decide to cease distribution of those respective products to customers and prospective customers, our ability to sell the INTERCEPT Blood System may be impaired and acceptance in the marketplace could be harmed.\nIn order to address the entire market in the U.S., Japan, and potentially elsewhere, we will need to develop and test additional configurations of the platelet system. For example, in the U.S., we understand a significant number of platelet concentrates are derived from larger volumes collected from apheresis donors split into three therapeutic transfusable doses. Future configurations of the platelet system will be needed to treat platelet donations with such processing parameters. We estimate that the majority of platelets used in the U.S. are collected by apheresis, though a significant minority is prepared from pooled random donor platelets derived from whole blood collections. In addition, many blood centers may view pooled random donor platelets treated with INTERCEPT as an economically optimal approach. In order to gain regulatory approvals for a pathogen reduction system compatible with triple dose collections, and random donor platelets, we will need to perform additional product development and testing, including additional clinical trials. We have conducted and may conduct additional in vitro studies for our platelet system to potentially expand our label claims to include, among others, platelets collected from pooled random donors, storage of INTERCEPT-treated platelets for up to seven days rather than five days, and a new processing set for triple dose collections. In the U.S, our approved labels for the platelet system from the FDA limit our current approvals to certain platelet collection platforms and a particular storage solution for the particular collection platform. For instance, our approved claims permit apheresis collection of platelets on the Fresenius Amicus device while stored in an additive solution or for apheresis collection of platelets collected on the Terumo Trima device and stored in 100% plasma. While we are seeking to generate acceptable data for Amicus collected platelets stored in 100% plasma, we cannot assure you that the data will be acceptable to the FDA or that we will receive timely approval, if ever. We may be required to provide the FDA with data for each permutation for which blood banking treatment practices exist which may be time consuming, costly and limit the potential size of the U.S. market that can use our products. Our failure to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approvals of any new configurations could significantly limit product revenue from sales of the platelet system. In addition, given that there is some loss of platelets using our product, blood centers may need to increase collection volumes in order to use our product and maintain an adequate concentration for a triple therapeutic dose. In any event, delays in receipt or failure to receive approval could reduce our sales and negatively impact our profitability potential and future growth prospects. Similarly, to achieve market acceptance in certain geographies, we may be required to design, develop and test new product configurations for the platelet and plasma systems. In addition, if the FDA or other regulatory or accrediting body were to mandate safety interventions, including the option of pathogen reduction technology, when we had not received approval for all operational configurations, the market to which we could sell our products may be limited until we obtain such approvals, if ever, or may be permanently impaired if competing options are more broadly available. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed certain product configuration activities, including extended storage platelets for the U.S. market and data generation for a platelet set used to treat and provide three therapeutic doses from a single platelet donor in the U.S. While activities surrounding these product configuration activities have resumed, should the pandemic persist or continue to worsen or should other factors outside of our control limit our ability to generate the aforementioned data needed for licensure, beyond the end of the compliance grace period covered by the FDA guidance document for platelet safety, customers and prospective customers may choose to implement other acceptable alternatives in order to comply with the guidance document. In addition, we will need to continue to generate acceptable data in order to conform with the evolving collection practices such as automated whole-blood collection. If we are unable to conform to evolving collection practices our ability to address those portions of the market may be compromised. These development activities will increase our costs significantly and may not be successful. We may need to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our platelet system using a variety of configurations before our platelet system would be approved for such configurations. Delays in obtaining any future approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our product revenue and potential future profitability.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Oversight, and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nOur products, blood products treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System and we are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign authorities. We will have to refile and obtain CE Mark approval under the MDR for all of our products and product candidates. If our preclinical and clinical data are not considered sufficient by a country\u2019s regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval, we will be unable to commercialize our products and generate product revenue in that country. Our investigational red blood cell system requires extensive additional testing and development.\nOur products, both those sold commercially and those under development are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by local, state and federal regulatory authorities in the U.S. and by foreign regulatory bodies. These regulations are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u2022\ndevelopment;\n\u2022\ntesting;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing;\n\u2022\nlabeling;\n\u2022\nstorage;\n\u2022\nclinical trials;\n\u2022\nenvironmental;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\npre-market clearance or approval;\n\u2022\nsales and distribution;\n\u2022\nuse standards and documentation;\n\u2022\nconformity assessment procedures;\n\u2022\nproduct traceability and record keeping procedures;\n\u2022\npost-launch surveillance and post-approval studies;\n\u2022\nquality;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u2022\nproduct import and export; and\n\u2022\nreimbursement.\nOur products must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy and we must adhere to quality standards regarding manufacturing and customer-facing business processes in order for the FDA and international regulatory authorities to approve them for commercial use. For our product candidates, we must provide the FDA and international regulatory authorities with preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data demonstrating that our products are safe, effective and in compliance with government regulations before the products can be approved for commercial sale. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals is expensive, uncertain and typically takes a number of years. We may continue to encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses, or we may not be successful at all. In addition, our labeling claims may not be consistent across markets. We have developed our products with the aim to standardize the volume of platelets treatable by our system, wherever possible, which may not be accepted by all regulators or customers, may require additional data to support approval or may not produce optimal transfusable blood components. For example, jurisdictions differ in the definition of what constitutes a transfusable unit of platelets and in certain jurisdictions, our approved label claims and the definition of a viable platelet unit for transfusion may allow for a significantly lower or higher platelet count per volume than certain jurisdictions may allow. This variability in platelet count per volume may result in differences in platelet quality once processed and stored using INTERCEPT, and if customers experience sub-optimal platelet quality following INTERCEPT treatment, they may limit their adoption of INTERCEPT or consider adoption of competing blood safety technologies over INTERCEPT. In addition, our approved labels from the FDA limit our current approvals to certain platelet collection platforms and a particular storage solution for the particular collection platform. For instance, our FDA approved claims permit apheresis collection of platelets on the Fresenius Amicus device while stored in an additive solution or for apheresis collection of platelets collected on the Terumo Trima device and stored in 100% plasma. While we and the manufacturers are generating data to support expansion of the approved claims for INTERCEPT-treated platelets collected on and used with additional storage solutions, we cannot assure you that the data generated will be acceptable to the FDA. Such discrepant collection methodologies and storage solutions and conditions also exist for red blood cells. We may be required to provide the FDA with data for each permutation for which blood banking treatment practices exist which may be time consuming, costly and limit the potential size of the U.S. market that can use our products. In addition, in order to generate data that would be satisfactory to the FDA, we need to test our products with different blood center production configurations producing otherwise saleable products for the blood center. As such, we will generally need to purchase blood components which are expensive and may be limited during periods of low availability. For example, we continue to experience such availability constraints for platelets, and expect even more constraints on availability during the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such inability to procure blood components at a reasonable price, or at all, to conduct studies in order to generate data sufficient for label claim expansions may negatively impact our business opportunities.\nClinical and Preclinical\nClinical trials are particularly expensive and have a high risk of failure. Any of our trials may fail or may not achieve results sufficient to attain market acceptance, which could prevent us from achieving profitability. We do not know whether we will begin or complete clinical trials on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a study, delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study agreement terms with prospective clinical sites, delays in obtaining institutional review board, ministry of health or ethics committee approval to conduct a study at a prospective clinical site, delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a study, delays in the conduct of the clinical trial by personnel at the clinical site or due to our inability to actively and timely monitor clinical trial sites because of travel restrictions, extreme weather or other natural forces, terrorist activity or general concerns over employee safety. In addition, during the current COVID-19 pandemic, several of the hospital clinical trial sites for our RedeS and ReCePI temporarily suspended the studies and several red blood cell production partners for the studies temporarily suspended production in order to conserve red blood cells to meet hospital demand during the pandemic. While certain enrollment sites and blood center production partners have resumed enrolling patients and producing INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells, many hospital sites have not yet resumed enrollment and those that have are proceeding at a reduced capacity. Further delays or a resurgence of COVID-19 at sites where we are conducting studies and trials may recur in the future should the COVID-19 pandemic persist or continue to worsen. We have restricted travel by our employees in states that are subject to mandatory stay-at-home orders and may again in the future need to restrict travel to certain clinical trial sites for monitoring site visits or to otherwise manage the trial. Significant delays in clinical testing could also materially impact our clinical trials. Some clinical sites for the RedeS study are located in areas that are also subject to disruption by severe weather such as flooding, hurricanes or other natural forces such as earthquakes, which have delayed enrollment and progress of the RedeS study in the past. We cannot be certain that further delays in the RedeS study or other clinical trials will not occur because of the pandemic or otherwise. Should our employees, notably laboratory-based personnel, see a surge in infections, our ability to complete research and development activities may be impaired. As such, certain studies and trials may be delayed for an extended period of time. We do not yet know when our employees will have access to a vaccine or if such a vaccine will be effective.\nCriteria for regulatory approval in blood safety indications are evolving, reflecting competitive advances in the standard of care against which new product candidates are judged, as well as changing market needs and reimbursement levels. Clinical trial design, including enrollment criteria, endpoints and anticipated label claims are thus subject to change, even if original objectives are being met. As a result, we do not know whether any clinical trial will result in marketable products. Typically, there is a high rate of failure for product candidates in preclinical studies and clinical trials and products emerging from any successful trial may not reach the market for several years.\nEnrollment criteria for certain of our clinical trials may be quite narrow, further delaying the clinical trial process. For instance, clinical trials previously conducted using INTERCEPT-treated plasma for patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura lasted approximately four years due in part to the difficulties associated with enrolling qualified patients. In addition, enrollment criteria impacted the speed with which we were able to enroll patients in our European Phase 3 red blood cell system trial in chronic anemia patients, ReCePI trial, and may impact other studies. Consequently, we may be unable to recruit suitable patients into clinical trials on a timely basis, if at all, which may lead to higher costs or the inability to complete the clinical trials. Given the need to phenotypically match donations and patients and the existing burden of managing the production and supply to sickle-cell anemia patients, donor recruitment in chronic anemia patients may be difficult or impractical, which may be costly or significantly delay or preclude our ability to obtain any FDA approval of our red blood cell system. We cannot rely on interim results of trials to predict their final results, and acceptable results in early trials might not be repeated in later trials. Any trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Negative or inconclusive results from a preclinical study or clinical trial, or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a preclinical study or clinical trial to be repeated, require other studies to be performed or cause a program to be terminated, even if other studies or trials relating to a program are successful.\nWe have conducted many toxicology studies to demonstrate the safety of the platelet and plasma systems, and we have conducted and plan to conduct toxicology studies for the red blood cell system throughout the product development process. At any time, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may require further toxicology or other studies to further demonstrate our products\u2019 safety, which could delay or preclude regulatory approval and commercialization. Furthermore, any major changes to components used in our products or configuration changes to our products may require additional toxicology studies which may not produce acceptable results. In addition, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may alter guidance at any time as to what constitutes acceptable clinical trial endpoints or trial design, which may necessitate a redesign of our product or proposed clinical trials and cause us to incur substantial additional expense or time in attempting to gain regulatory approval. Regulatory agencies weigh the potential risks of using our pathogen reduction products against the incremental benefits, which may be difficult or impossible to quantify.\nIf any additional product candidates receive approval for commercial sale in the U.S., or if we obtain approval for expanded label claims for the platelet system or plasma system, the FDA may require one or more post-approval clinical or in vitro studies as a condition of approval, such as the post-approval clinical study we are conducting in connection with the approval of the platelet\nsystem and the additional post-approval study that we are required to conduct on recovery and survival of platelets suspended in 100% plasma in connection with the expanded label claim that we received for the platelet system. Each of these studies and any additional studies that the FDA may require could involve significant expense and may require us to secure adequate funding to complete. In addition, enrollment of post-marketing studies may be difficult to complete timely if customers of blood centers are reluctant to accept conventional, non-INTERCEPT-treated products once INTERCEPT products become available to them. Other regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. may also require post-marketing studies. Governments or regulatory authorities may impose new regulations or other changes or we may discover that we are subject to additional regulations that could further delay or preclude regulatory approval and subsequent adoption of our potential products. We cannot predict the adoption, implementation or impact of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action. Under the Final Guidance Document our INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets is an approved option for blood centers to meet the guidance document requirements. However, we do not yet have approved label claims for all platelet processing standards or storage claims supporting transfusion of INTERCEPT-treated platelets out to seven days. Our inability to meet such operational or processing constraints may impair our potential results permanently or until we are able to obtain such claims, or customers may be forced to choose alternative options to comply with the guidance document by the end of the extended compliance grace period, October 1, 2021. Should that occur, we may be unable to subsequently convert blood centers to INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets which would limit our market potential. In addition, we do not know what effect, if any, the COVID-19 pandemic will have on blood centers abilities to comply with the guidance document. If the COVID-19 crisis persists or continues to worsen, customers may not be able to implement new technologies such as INTERCEPT and may instead choose to utilize other allowable methods with which they have more familiarity. Moreover, if hospitals are not able or willing to allow our employees to gain access to their facility or personnel, our ability to market and commercialize PRCFC directly to hospitals may be impaired and our results of operations negatively impacted. Outside the U.S., regulations vary by country, including the requirements for regulatory and marketing approvals or clearance, the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations. In addition to CE Mark documentation, countries outside the E.U. may require clinical data submissions, registration packages, import licenses or other documentation. Regulatory authorities in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and elsewhere may require in-country clinical trial data, among other requirements, or that our products be widely adopted commercially in Europe and the U.S., or may delay such approval decisions until our products are more widely adopted. In addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and to our products, there are regulatory requirements in several countries around the world, including the U.S., Germany, Canada, Austria, Australia and other countries, applicable to prospective customers of INTERCEPT Blood System products and the blood centers that process and distribute blood and blood products. In those countries, blood centers and other customers are required to obtain approved license supplements from the appropriate regulatory authorities before making available blood products processed with our pathogen reduction systems to hospitals and transfusing physicians. Our customers may lack the resources or capability to obtain such regulatory approvals. In Germany, blood centers need to obtain marketing authorizations before they can submit for reimbursement or sell to hospitals. Significant product changes or changes in the way customers use our products may require amendments or supplemental approvals to licenses already obtained. Blood centers that do submit applications, supplements or amendments for manufacturing and sale may face disapproval or delays in approval that could further delay or deter them from using our products. The regulatory impact on potential customers could slow or limit the potential sales of our products.\nRed Blood Cell System\nWhile we are in the process of submitting for CE Mark approval of our red blood cell system, it has not been approved or commercialized anywhere in the world. Significant development and financial resources will be required to progress the red blood cell system into a commercially viable product and to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the product. Final development of the red blood cell system may never occur and failure can occur any time during the process. Any failure or delay in completing the development activities for the red blood cell system would prevent or delay its commercialization, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects and potential future market adoption of any of our products, including the red blood cell system. Many of the factors described above that can contribute to the failure or delay of a clinical trial could impact the trials we conduct for our red blood cell system. Even if we are successful in earlier clinical trials, the results of those early trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later and larger clinical trials of the red blood cell system or the results of routine use if we are able to commercialize the red blood cell system. In those cases, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or further studies or analysis which may be costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, regulators may require clinical data for our red blood cell system under each collection and processing method using various additive or storage solutions before they would grant approval for any such configuration. The clinical data we have generated thus far and submitted for CE Mark approval does not support multiple configurations of collection processes, storage solutions and kits. If we are required to and are ultimately unable to collect data under each configuration or if we limit our pursuit of certain configurations over others, our market opportunity may be limited. In some instances, we are relying on contract research organizations and other third parties to assist us in designing, managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our clinical trials and development activities for the red blood cell system. We do not control these third parties and, as a result, they may not treat our activities as their highest priority, or in the manner in which we would prefer, which could result in delays, inefficient use of our resources and could distract personnel from other activities. Additionally, if we, our contract research organizations, other third parties assisting us or our study sites fail to comply with applicable good clinical practices, the clinical data generated in our trials may be\ndeemed unreliable and the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving the red blood cell system for commercialization. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, regulatory agencies will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with good clinical practices. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and similar regulations outside of the U.S. Our failure or the failure of our product manufacturers to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat or redesign clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We must be able to demonstrate stability of our active compounds manufactured under cGMP which meets release specifications. We have not been able to demonstrate that our product manufacturers or we are able to meet those requirements. If we are unable to demonstrate an ability to manufacture according to our specifications under cGMP with acceptable stability data, we may be unable to satisfy regulatory questions and requirements which could prevent or delay the potential approval of or our ability to commercialize the red blood cell system. In addition, existing lots of these red blood cell compounds manufactured under cGMP may be dispositioned by regulators or ourselves as unsuitable clinical use which would impact our ability to produce INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells for ongoing and future clinical trials and may require changes to the manufacturing process of our red blood cell compounds or new production of the compounds, all of which would be costly and time consuming and impact our ability to perform under our BARDA contract. Over the past few years, qualified and prospective suppliers of one of the key reagents used in our red blood cell system have declared bankruptcy. We recently qualified a different manufacturer to produce the key reagent compound for our red blood cell system beyond our existing inventory levels, although production is in much smaller batch sizes which may prove more costly. We may pursue identification and qualification of another reagent supplier which may be costly, time consuming or unsuccessful. Other suppliers may become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, which would negatively impact our ability to produce our products or components to our products. Although we will try to identify and qualify alternate manufacturers, and negotiate new agreements on favorable terms, we may be unable to produce product or complete clinical studies on-time, if at all. We also understand that stricter regulations are being considered for certain raw materials used in our red blood cell processing sets, notably non-DEHP plastics. Should such regulations be enacted we may need to qualify alternate plastics which comply with the stricter regulations which may be costly and time consuming.\nIn 2003, we terminated Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating a prior generation of the red blood cell system in acute and chronic anemia patients. The trials were terminated due to the detection of antibody reactivity to INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells in two patients in the 2003 chronic anemia trial. Although the antibody reactivity was not associated with any adverse events, we developed process changes designed to diminish the likelihood of antibody reactivity in red blood cells treated with our modified process. In a subsequent Phase 1 clinical trial that we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 to evaluate recovery and survival of treated red blood cells with the modified process, there were no adverse events reported. Based on the results from that trial, we obtained approval for and commenced two Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe using the modified process in patients with acute and chronic anemia, respectively. We successfully completed the European Phase 3 acute anemia clinical trial and the European Phase 3 chronic anemia clinical trial, with the INTERCEPT Blood System for red blood cells meeting its primary efficacy and safety endpoints in both trials. However, we cannot assure you that the adverse events observed in the terminated 2003 Phase 3 clinical trials of our earlier red blood cell system will not be observed in the future. In addition, although our completed European Phase 3 clinical trials in acute anemia patients and chronic anemia patients using our modified process met their primary endpoints, we cannot assure you that the same or similar results will be observed in current and potential future clinical trials using our modified process. We cannot assure you that patients receiving INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells will not develop allergic reactions to the transfusion.\nWe will need to successfully conduct and complete license enabling Phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. and to generate sufficient chronic anemia data for licensure. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption in enrolling patients in clinical trials in the U.S. While those trials are currently enrolling patients, they may be disrupted again should the pandemic continue to worsen or recur in areas enrolling patients. Even prior to the pandemic, our ReCePI study in complex cardiovascular surgery patients had been slower to enroll due to a variety of factors including low frequency of administering red blood cells to the patient population. If we are unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients from the ReCePI study to generate the data needed for licensure, we will need to reach agreement with the FDA on a new pathway to generate sufficient data, including the potential for additional Phase 3 clinical trials beyond what is currently contemplated with the RedeS and ReCePI studies. Given the need to phenotypically match donations and patients and the existing burden of managing the production and supply to sickle-cell anemia patients, donor recruitment in chronic anemia patients may be difficult or impractical, which could significantly delay or preclude our ability to obtain any FDA approval of our red blood cell system. In any event, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete these prerequisite Phase 3 clinical trials or otherwise generate sufficient Phase 3 clinical data. In part, we will seek to introduce supplemental clinical data we obtained from European clinical trials, though we cannot assure you that we will be able to demonstrate comparability or that the FDA will allow supplemental clinical European data. The FDA has recently agreed to modify the criteria for a clinical pause in the RedeS study if we see three or more treatment emergent antibodies with amustaline specificity without evidence of hemolysis in patients receiving INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells in that study. We will now be allowed to continue study enrollment for the RedeS study while we investigate the clinical significance of the antibodies. If we determine that there is no clinical significance and no impact on patients, then there will be no impact on study enrollment. If treatment emergent antibody reactions associated with hemolysis are observed in any of our Phase 3 trials, the FDA will require us to place a clinical hold and we will need to investigate the underlying cause. Such investigations may be difficult for us to assess imputability which may lead to a complete halt of the clinical trial, may irreparably harm our red blood cell product\u2019s reputation and may force us to suspend or terminate development activities\nrelated to the red blood cell system in the U.S., which would have a material adverse effect on our business and business prospects. Should we see events where antibodies to amustaline (S-303) are formed without evidence of hemolysis, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, and we will need to assess the underlying information and either agree to continue the study or either delay completion of the study or permanently halt the study until we can demonstrate that the antibodies were not clinically significant. To date, two S-303 antibody events without evidence of hemolysis have been detected in the RedeS study. We do not yet know if the S-303 antibody events were in the control or test arm, however the events are not clinically significant. These events have been reviewed by the DSMB who did not express concerns with respect to patient safety. We cannot provide any assurance that additional S-303 antibody events will not occur, or if they do occur, will not be clinically significant.\nWe completed our European Phase 3 clinical trials of our red blood cell system for acute anemia patients and separately for chronic anemia patients. We filed our application for CE Mark approval of the red blood cell system in December 2018 under the Medical Device Directive, or MDD, and in September 2020, we began the process to resubmit our application under the new MDR. Accordingly, we do not expect to receive any regulatory approvals of our red blood cell system prior to 2022, if ever. We do not yet know whether the data generated from our European Phase 3 clinical trials will be sufficient to receive CE Mark approval or if we will be able to receive broad label claim approval for both acute and chronic anemia indications. Furthermore, we do not yet know if the clinical data we have generated will be sufficient to satisfy the stricter standards imposed by the MDR, when we transition to that standard. If such data is deemed insufficient, we may need to generate additional safety data in clinical trials to satisfy the MDR standards. We may also need to generate additional safety data from commercial use in order to achieve broad label claim or market acceptance. In addition, the European Phase 3 clinical trials in acute, and separately, chronic anemia patients, may need to be supplemented by additional, successful Phase 3 clinical trials for approval in certain countries. If such additional Phase 3 clinical trials are required, they would likely need to demonstrate equivalency of INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells compared to conventional, un-treated red blood cells and the significantly lower lifespan for INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells compared to conventional, un-treated red blood cells may limit our ability to obtain any regulatory approvals in certain countries for the red blood cell system. A number of trial design issues that could impact efficacy, regulatory approval and market acceptance will need to be resolved prior to the initiation of further clinical trials. In addition, if we are unable to secure the full amount of funding contemplated by the BARDA agreement for any reason, or if the costs to complete the activities are more than allowed for by our BARDA agreement, our ability to complete the development activities required for potential licensure in the U.S. may require additional capital beyond that which we currently have, and we may be required to obtain additional capital in order to complete the development of and obtain any regulatory approvals for the red blood cell system. In addition, certain activities expected to be performed under our BARDA agreement have been significantly delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Should BARDA disallow extensions of time to perform the contemplated activities, we would have to either fund the completion of the activities ourselves or discontinue pursuit. Further, while we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash to be received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, if we are unable to generate sufficient product revenue, or access sufficient funds under our BARDA agreement or the public and private equity and debt capital markets, we may be unable to execute successfully on our operating plan. If alternative sources of funding are not available, we may be forced to suspend or terminate development activities related to the red blood cell system in the U.S. which would have a material adverse effect on our business and business prospects. If we are unsuccessful in advancing the red blood cell system through clinical trials, resolving process and product design issues or in obtaining subsequent regulatory approvals and acceptable reimbursement rates, we may never realize a return on our R&D expenses incurred to date for the red blood cell system program. Regulatory delays can also materially impact our product development costs. When we experience delays in testing, conducting trials or approvals, our product development costs will increase, which costs may not be reimbursable to us under the BARDA agreement. Even if we were to successfully complete and receive approval for our red blood cell system, potential blood center customers may object to working with a potent chemical, like amustaline, the active compound in the red blood cell system, or may require modifications to automate the process, which would result in additional development costs, any of which could limit any market acceptance of the red blood cell system. If the red blood cell system were to face such objections from potential customers, we may choose to pay for capital assets, specialized equipment or personnel for the blood center, which would have a negative impact on any potential contribution margin from red blood cell system sales. Moreover, customers may not accept the manual configuration of the product and require us to develop a more operationally scalable version of the system which would be expensive and may not be successful. Additionally, the use of the red blood cell system may result in some processing loss of red blood cells. If the loss of red blood cells leads to increased costs, or the perception of increased costs for potential customers, or potential customers believe that the loss of red blood cells reduces the efficacy of the transfusion unit, or our process requires changes in blood center or clinical regimens, potential customers may not adopt our red blood cell system even if approved for commercial sale.\nPlatelet and Plasma Systems\nIn 2007, we obtained a CE Mark approval from E.U. regulators for our platelet system under the MDD and have subsequently received periodic extensions in accordance with the five-year renewal schedule. In March 2020, we received an extension of the CE Mark approval to 2024, under the MDD. While we currently received an extension of registration under the MDD, we cannot assure you that our products will timely meet the requirements of the new MDR prior to the expiration of the MDD extension. We or our customers have received approval for the sale and/or use of INTERCEPT-treated platelets within Europe in France, Switzerland,\nGermany and Austria. We or our customers may also be required to conduct additional testing in order to obtain regulatory approval in countries that do not recognize the CE Mark as being adequate for commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System in those countries. The level of additional product testing varies by country, but could be expensive or take a long time to complete. In addition, regulatory agencies are able to withdraw or suspend previously issued approvals due to changes in regulatory law, our inability to maintain compliance with regulations or other factors.\nIn 2006, we obtained a CE Mark approval from E.U. regulators for our plasma system under the MDD and have subsequently received periodic extensions in accordance with the five-year renewal schedule. In March 2020, we received an extension of the CE Mark approval to 2024, under the MDD. While we currently received an extension of registration under the MDD, we cannot assure you that our products will timely meet the requirements of the new MDR prior to the expiration of the MDD extension. We or our customers have received approval for the sale and/or use INTERCEPT-treated plasma within Europe in France, Switzerland, Germany and Austria. In some countries, including several in Europe, we or our customers may be required to perform additional clinical studies or submit manufacturing and marketing applications in order to obtain regulatory approval. If we or our customers are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for the use and sale or continued sale and use of INTERCEPT-treated platelets or plasma, market adoption of our products will be negatively affected and our growth prospects would be materially and adversely impacted.\nThe FDA has approved the platelet system for ex vivo preparation of pathogen-reduced apheresis platelet components collected and stored in InterSol and 100% plasma in order to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection, or TTI, including sepsis, and as an alternative to gamma irradiation for prevention of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease, or TA-GVHD. Additionally, the FDA approved the plasma system for ex vivo preparation of pathogen-reduced, whole blood derived or apheresis plasma in order to reduce the risk of TTI when treating patients requiring therapeutic plasma transfusion and as an alternative to gamma irradiation for prevention of TA-GVHD. We have conducted and are conducting additional in vitro studies for our platelet system to potentially expand our label claims to include, among others, platelets collected from pooled random donors, storage of INTERCEPT-treated platelets for up to seven days rather than five days, and a new processing set for triple dose collections. Failure to obtain any of these label expansion claims may negatively affect market adoption and our growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a condition to the initial FDA approval of the platelet system, we are required to submit data from a post-approval clinical study of the platelet system. Although we have recently completed this study, we are in the process of evaluating the data from the study. If the study reveals unacceptable safety risks, we could be required to perform additional studies, which may be costly, and even lose U.S. marketing approval of the platelet system. Further, we are required to conduct a post-approval recovery and survival clinical study in connection with the label expansion approval for the use of the platelet system to treat platelets suspended in 100% plasma. Successful enrollment and completion of this additional study will also require that we identify and contract with hospitals that have the desire and ability to participate and contribute to the study in a timely manner and who are willing to purchase INTERCEPT-treated platelets from our blood center customers. Previously these studies and other studies had been delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be delayed in the future if the COVID-19 pandemic persists or continues to worsen. If we are unable to complete the required studies in a timely manner or at all, or the results of the studies reveal unacceptable safety risks, we could be required to perform additional studies, which may be costly. In addition, the FDA may also require us to commit to perform other lengthy post-marketing studies, for which we would have to expend significant additional resources, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and stock price. In addition, there is a risk that these studies will show results inconsistent with our previous studies. Should this happen, potential customers may delay or choose not to adopt the INTERCEPT Blood System and existing customers may cease use of the INTERCEPT Blood System.\nINTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation to Produce Pathogen Reduced Cryoprecipitated Fibrinogen Complex and Pathogen Reduced Plasma, Cryoprecipitate Reduced\nIn November 2020, we obtained FDA approval of INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation to produce PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced. We are currently validating with our manufacturing partners the process to produce these new products in accordance with our specifications. Once the process at our manufacturing partners is validated, we will be eligible to sell and deliver these new products only to hospital customers in the state of manufacture until our manufacturing partners receive approval of their manufacturing site Biologics License Applications, or BLAs. We cannot provide any assurance that our manufacturing partners will receive BLA approval from the FDA on a timely basis or at all. In addition, in order to market and sell PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced to hospital customers throughout the U.S., we will need to identify and validate additional manufacturing partners. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate additional agreements with manufacturing partners on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional manufacturing partners, our ability to market and sell our new products outside of the four states where we currently have manufacturing partners may be severely curtailed or limited. PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced are products derived from our INTERCEPT Blood System for plasma. As such, any supply disruptions or failures that could impact our plasma system will have a direct negative impact on the production of pathogen reduced cryoprecipitated fibrinogen complex and its derivative product, pathogen reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced. Such supply\ndisruptions could negatively impact our ability to fulfill customer orders, which will have an adverse effect on our business reputation and the successful introduction and adoption of our new products.\nPost-Marketing Approval\nWe are also required to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements now that we have obtained approval for the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitation. These requirements relate to, among other things, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other information. In addition, our manufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and foreign regulatory agency requirements, including, in the U.S., ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP and current QSR requirements. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections. We understand that the manufacturing facility which produces our platelet and plasma systems will be audited by the FDA in the near term. We and our contract manufacturers will need to satisfactorily resolve and comply with adverse findings of the audit, if any. Complying with and resolving any audit findings may result in additional costs, changes to our manufacturers\u2019 quality management systems or both. Failure to timely resolve and comply to audit findings, if any, may result in enforcement actions and may result in a disruption to the supply of our products. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. We are required to report certain adverse events and production problems, if any, to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, when applicable, and must additionally comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. For example, our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, use. An off-label use is the use of a product for an indication that is not described in the product\u2019s FDA-approved label in the U.S. or for uses in other jurisdictions that differ from those approved by the applicable regulatory agencies. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off-label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment made in the physician\u2019s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product\u2019s FDA approved labeling. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, or a violation or any other federal or state law that applies to us, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Any enforcement action brought by a federal, state or foreign authority could result in significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings. In addition, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend, divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us and harm our reputation. Regulatory authorities may also challenge the classification of our approvals for our products.\nShould a regulatory agency question a reported adverse event, we may not be able to rule out product failure as the cause, whether or not product failure is the cause of the reported adverse event. If a regulatory agency suspects or discovers problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility or the manufacturing process at the facility where the product is manufactured, or problems with the quality of product manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing, or labeling of a product, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on use of that product, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by regulatory agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nadverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrepair, replacement, recall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\ndelaying or refusing our requests for approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to our existing products and regulatory strategies;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export or import approval for our products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing marketing approvals that have already been granted, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of these actions, in combination or alone, could prevent us from selling our products and harm our business. In addition, any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing or changing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize and generate additional product revenues from our platelet and plasma systems or any future products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to continue to generate product revenues from the sale of our platelet and plasma systems, our potential for achieving operating profitability will be diminished and the need for additional capital to fund our operations will be increased.\nShould we obtain approval of our red blood cell system, we will likely be required by regulators to collect additional data in patients receiving INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells. In addition, we may be required to develop a registry of patients receiving INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells for future data collection and evaluation. Should we become subject to such a requirement post-approval, we may incur significant costs to develop, create and implement such a registry. Further, introducing and implementing use of such a registry may face data collection challenges or resistance from transfusing physicians, hospitals or patients. We cannot ensure that the data collected in such a registry would support continued use of INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells.\nIn addition, the regulations to which we are subject are complex and have become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, increased operation costs or lower than anticipated sales. For instance, we understand that we will have to re-register our CE Marked products under the new MDR, (as required by all manufacturers who sell in Europe under a CE Mark), while we anticipate this will be a formality, there is always a possibility of new requirements. Complying with the new MDR will require considerable time, attention and effort by our manufacturers and us and may limit or delay any contemplated changes to our products or expansion of label claims.\nIf we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s or other regulatory agency\u2019s good manufacturing practice regulations, it could impair our ability to market our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nIn order to be used in clinical studies or sold in the U.S., our products are required to be manufactured in FDA-approved facilities. If any of our suppliers fail to comply with FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations or otherwise fail to maintain FDA approval, we may be required to identify an alternate supplier for our products or components. Our products are complex and difficult to manufacture. Finding alternate facilities and obtaining FDA approval for the manufacture of the INTERCEPT Blood System at such facilities would be costly and time-consuming and would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenue from the sale of our platelet or plasma system in the U.S. and achieve operating profitability. Our red blood cell system also needs to be manufactured in FDA-approved facilities, several of which, are not currently FDA-approved. Failure of our suppliers to meet cGMP regulations and failure to obtain or maintain FDA approval will negatively impact our ability to achieve FDA approval for our red blood cell system or may require that we identify, qualify and contract with alternative suppliers, if they are available, which would be time consuming, costly and result in further approval delays.\nWe and our third-party suppliers are also required to comply with the cGMP and QSR requirements, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA and other regulatory agencies audit compliance with cGMP and QSR requirements through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. These audits and inspections may be conducted at any time. We understand that the manufacturing facility which produces our platelet and plasma systems will be audited by the FDA in the near term. If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to cGMP and QSR requirements, have significant non-compliance issues or fail to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, or if any corrective action plan that we or our suppliers propose in response to observed deficiencies is not sufficient, the FDA or other regulatory agency could take enforcement action against us, which could delay production of our products and may include:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing marketing approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export or import approval for our products; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, our key suppliers may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all. In addition, before any additional products would be considered for marketing approval in the U.S. or elsewhere, our suppliers will have to pass an audit by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. We are dependent on our suppliers\u2019 cooperation and ability to pass such audits. Such audits and any audit remediation may be costly. Failure to pass such audits by any of our suppliers would affect our ability to obtain licensure in the U.S. or elsewhere.\nIf we modify our FDA-approved products, we may need to seek additional approvals, which, if not granted, would prevent us from selling our modified products.\nAny modifications to the platelet, plasma or cryoprecipitation systems that could significantly affect their safety or effectiveness, including significant design and manufacturing changes, or that would constitute a major change in their intended use, manufacture, design, components, or technology requires approval of a new premarket approval application, or PMA, or PMA supplement. Further, any modification to our plasma system may have an impact on the cryoprecipitation system, which may similarly require approval of a new PMA Supplement. However, certain changes to a PMA-approved device do not require submission and approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement and may only require notice to FDA in a PMA Annual Report. The FDA requires every supplier to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any supplier\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new submissions or approvals are necessary. Our products could be subject to recall if the FDA determines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective or that appropriate regulatory submissions were not made. If new regulatory approvals are required, this could delay or preclude our ability to market the modified system. For example, due to the obsolescence of certain parts, we have redesigned the illuminators used in the platelet and plasma systems and may need to further redesign the illuminator. We will need to obtain regulatory approval of any future redesign of the illuminator before it can be commercialized in the U.S. or under CE Mark. We understand that a solvent used to make the plastic beads in our plasma compound adsorption devices is no longer available. Although we have contracted with the manufacturer to produce a significant quantity of the existing material, we will need to qualify plastic beads produced with a new solvent prior to consuming available inventory levels. In addition, in order to address the entire market in the U.S., we will need to obtain approval for additional configurations of the platelet system, including triple dose collections and random donor platelets. Our approved labels from the FDA limit our current approvals to certain platelet collection platforms and a particular storage solution for the particular collection platform. For instance, our approved claims permit apheresis collection of platelets on the Fresenius Amicus device while stored in an additive solution or for apheresis collection of platelets collected on the Terumo Trima device and stored in 100% plasma. Such discrepant collection methodologies and storage solutions and conditions also exist for red blood cells. We may be required to provide the FDA with data for each permutation for which blood banking treatment practices exist which may be time consuming, costly and limit the potential size of the U.S. market that can use our products. We have conducted and may conduct additional in vitro studies for our platelet system to potentially expand our label claims to include, among others, platelets collected from pooled random donors, storage of INTERCEPT-treated platelets for up to seven days rather than five days, and a new processing set for triple dose collections. Our failure to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approvals of new platelet and plasma product configurations could significantly limit product revenues from sales of the platelet and plasma systems. In any event, delays in receipt or failure to receive approvals, the loss of previously received approvals, or the failure to comply with any other existing or future regulatory requirements, could reduce our sales and negatively impact our profitability potential and future growth prospects. In addition, if the FDA or other regulatory or accrediting body were to mandate safety interventions, including the option of pathogen reduction technology, when we had not received approval for all operational configurations, the market to which we could sell our products may be limited until we obtain such approvals, if ever, or may be permanently impaired if competing options are more broadly available.\nWe have no experience selling to hospitals or expertise complying with regulations governing finished biologics, and our inability to successfully commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation in the U.S would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation in the U.S. will depend on our ability to do the following, among other things:\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance and generate product sales through execution of sales agreements on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nenter into and maintain sufficient manufacturing arrangements for the U.S. market with our third-party manufacturers of the pathogen reduced-cryoprecipitated fibrinogen complex and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced;\n\u2022\nsupport blood center manufacturing partners in obtaining biologic license applications (BLAs) for interstate commerce;\n\u2022\ncreate market demand through our education, marketing and sales activities, including the ability to demonstrate to the transfusion community and other health care constituencies that pathogen reduction, including pathogen reduced-cryoprecipitated fibrinogen complex for the treatment and control of bleeding, and the INTERCEPT Blood System is safe, effective and cost effective;\n\u2022\nhire, train, deploy, support and maintain a qualified U.S.-based commercial organization and field sales force;\n\u2022\ncomply with requirements established by the FDA, including post-marketing requirements and label restrictions; and\n\u2022\ncomply with other U.S. healthcare regulatory requirements.\nOur ability to commercialize pathogen reduced-cryoprecipitated fibrinogen complex and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced in the U.S. will initially be limited to the four states of California, Texas, Louisiana and Wisconsin. Our ability to sell this product in other states is dependent on the approval of manufacturing site BLAs by the FDA and we cannot be sure that the sites will receive such authorizations in a timely manner, if at all.\nWhile we are working on implementing the infrastructure we believe will be necessary to market pathogen reduced-cryoprecipitated fibrinogen complex and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced directly to hospitals, we have no experience selling to hospitals nor do we have experience or expertise complying with regulations governing finished biologics. If we are unable to successfully market this product to hospitals or comply with such unique regulations, our ability to monetize and deliver such product will be negatively impacted.\nIf the COVID-19 crisis persists or continues to worsen, customers may not be able to implement new technologies such as INTERCEPT and may instead choose to utilize other allowable methods with which they have more familiarity. Moreover, if hospitals are not able or willing to allow our employees to gain access to their facility or personnel, our ability to market and commercialize PRCFC directly to hospitals may be impaired and our results of operations negatively impacted.\nWe operate a complex global commercial organization, with limited experience in many countries. We have limited resources and experience complying with regulatory, legal, tax and political complexities as we expand into new and increasingly broad geographies.\nWe are responsible for worldwide sales, marketing, distribution, maintenance and regulatory support of the INTERCEPT Blood System. If we fail in our efforts to develop or maintain such internal competencies or establish acceptable relationships with third parties to support us in these areas on a timely basis, our ability to commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System may be irreparably harmed.\nWe have a wholly-owned subsidiary, headquartered in the Netherlands, dedicated primarily to selling and marketing the platelet and plasma systems in Europe, the CIS and the Middle East. Our commercial activities for the U.S., Latin and South America and Asia are based out of our headquarters in Concord, California with certain support from our European headquarters in the Netherlands, with certain individuals servicing Latin and South America and Asia, domiciled outside of the U.S. Given the relatively concentrated customer base in the U.S., coupled with the FDA guidance document on platelet safety requiring all blood centers to comply by March 2021 by using a relatively small number of options, including INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, should blood centers deploy INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets rapidly, our resources may be inadequate to fulfill the demands, which could result in a loss of product revenues or customer contracts, or both. We will need to maintain and may need to increase our competence and size in a number of functions, including sales, deployment and product support, marketing, regulatory, inventory and logistics, customer service, credit and collections, risk management, and quality assurance systems in order to successfully support our commercialization activities in all of the jurisdictions we currently sell and market, or anticipate selling and marketing, our products. Many of these\ncompetencies require compliance with U.S., E.U., South American, Asian and local standards and practices, including regulatory, legal and tax requirements, some of which we have limited experience. In this regard, should we obtain regulatory approval in an increased number of geographies, we will need to ensure that we maintain a sufficient number of personnel or develop new business processes to ensure ongoing compliance with the multitude of regulatory requirements in those territories. Hiring, training and retaining new personnel is costly, time consuming and distracting to existing employees and management. We have limited experience operating on a global scale and we may be unsuccessful complying with the variety and complexity of laws and regulations in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, in some cases, the cost of obtaining approval and maintaining compliance with certain regulations and laws may exceed the product revenue that we recognize from such a territory, which would adversely affect our results of operations and could adversely affect our financial condition. Furthermore, we may choose to seek alternative ways to sell or treat blood components with our products. These may include new business models, which may include selling kits to blood centers, performing inactivation ourselves, staffing blood centers or selling services or other business model changes. We have no experience with these types of business models, or the regulatory requirements or licenses needed to pursue such new business models. Additionally, such business models may be viewed as a threat to existing customers. We cannot assure you that we will pursue such business models or if we do, that we will be successful or that our existing customers will not feel threatened.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d We may face new regulatory costs and challenges as a result of Brexit that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Altered regulations could add time and expense to the process by which our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, regulatory, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have and how such withdrawal will affect us.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties and harm our reputation and business.\nWe are subject to a number of laws that affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians, healthcare providers or other potential purchasers of our products. These laws are often broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances. For example, within the E.U., the control of unlawful marketing activities is a matter of national law and regulations in each of the member states. There are a variety of organizations and entities within E.U. member states which monitor perceived unlawful marketing activities. We could face civil, criminal and administrative sanctions if it is determined that we have breached our obligations in any E.U, member state in respect of our marketing activities. Industry associations also closely monitor the activities of member companies. If these organizations or authorities name us as having breached our obligations under their regulations, rules or standards, our reputation would suffer and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, there are numerous U.S. federal, state and local healthcare regulatory laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, privacy laws, and transparency laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and entities, including but not limited to, hospitals, physicians, healthcare providers and our customers are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws can subject us to significant penalties, including, but not limited to, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment of our operations. Healthcare fraud and abuse regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce, the referral of an individual for, the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens on behalf of the government, through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and the federal civil monetary penalties law, that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal payors that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customer;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or making materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates and their subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections; and\n\u2022\nforeign, or U.S. state or local law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; U.S. state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; U.S. state and local laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and U.S. state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased U.S. federal, state and local regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. Section 6002 of the ACA, known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to track and annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information related to payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to certain other healthcare professionals, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives. A manufacturer\u2019s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in significant civil monetary penalties. Due to the difficulty in complying with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, we cannot assure that we will successfully report all payments and transfers of value provided by us, and any failure to comply could result in significant fines and penalties. Some states, such as California and Connecticut, also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, and other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that we may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.\nWe are also subject to domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. Domestic privacy and data security laws are complex and changing rapidly. Many states have enacted laws regulating the online collection, use and disclosure of personal information and requiring that companies implement reasonable data security measures. Laws in all states and U.S. territories also require businesses to notify affected individuals, governmental entities and/or credit reporting agencies of certain security breaches affecting personal information. These laws are not consistent, and compliance with them in the event of a widespread data breach is complex and costly.\nIn the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA gives California residents expanded rights related to their personal information, including the right to access and delete their personal information, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used and shared. These create an additional burden on us, as do the restrictions on \u201csales\u201d of personal information that allow Californians to opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information. The CCPA prohibits discrimination against individuals who exercise their privacy rights, provides for civil penalties for violations and creates a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Similarly, the CPRA, when it becomes effective on January 1, 2023, will restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines.\nIn the E.U., the GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the documentation we must maintain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U. and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater. One of the mechanisms for transfers of personal data from Europe to\nthe U.S., the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in a July 2020 decision. The decision also called into question whether companies can lawfully use the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses as a compliance mechanism for transfers of personal information from Europe to the United States or most other countries.\nThe CCPA, GDPR and other privacy laws have increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process compared to prior law, including in clinical trials and employee data, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with these laws, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business. However, despite our ongoing efforts to bring our practices into compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control or other factors outside our control. It is also possible that local courts and data protection authorities may have different interpretations of applicable law, leading to potential inconsistencies in application of these laws. If we are unable to implement sufficient safeguards to ensure that our transfers of personal information from Europe are lawful, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing personal information from Europe.\nAny failure or alleged failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures or measures relating to privacy, data security, marketing or communications) by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or contractual obligations, industry standards or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity. In addition, new regulation, legislative actions or changes in interpretation of existing laws or regulations regarding data privacy and security (together with applicable industry standards) may increase our costs of doing business.\nWe are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws with a significant anti-corruption intent in foreign countries. In general, there is a worldwide trend to strengthen anticorruption laws and their enforcement. Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create a substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. We currently operate in many countries where the public sector is perceived as being more or highly corrupt. Our strategic business plans include expanding our business in regions and countries that are rated as higher risk for corruption activity, such as China, India and Russia. Becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigate and protect against corruption risks could be quite costly. In addition, failure by us or our agents or distributors to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could delay our expansion into high-growth markets, could damage market perception of our business and could adversely affect our existing business operations. Increased business in higher risk countries could also subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability.\nFurther, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity can now be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Moreover, while we do not submit claims and our customers make the ultimate decision on how to submit claims, from time-to-time, we may provide reimbursement guidance to our customers. If a government authority were to conclude that we provided improper advice to our customers or encouraged the submission of false claims for reimbursement, we could face action against us by government authorities. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with healthcare providers and entities, including, but not limited to, hospitals, physicians, healthcare providers and our distributors, and certain sales and marketing practices, including the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.\nTo enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, federal and state enforcement bodies have increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nMost of these laws apply to not only the actions taken by us, but also actions taken by our distributors or other third-party agents. We have limited knowledge and control over the business practices of our distributors and agents, and we may face regulatory action against us as a result of their actions which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. U.S. federal or state regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Any U.S. federal or state or foreign regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether or not retroactive. Compliance with these and other changing regulations will increase our costs and may require increasing management attention.\nLegislative, regulatory, or other healthcare reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our products and to produce, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nRegulatory guidance and regulations are often revised or reinterpreted by the regulatory agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. Delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, regulatory approvals for our new products or product configurations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal and state governments in the U.S. have enacted legislation to overhaul the nation\u2019s healthcare system. While the goal of healthcare reform is to expand coverage to more individuals, it also involves increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. The ACA significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other things, the ACA:\n\u2022\nestablished a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; and\n\u2022\nimplemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models.\nThere remain judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of the ACA, as well as efforts that were taken by the U.S. government to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. Legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Any repeal and replace legislation may have the effect of limiting the amounts that government agencies will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure, or may lead to significant deregulation, which could make the introduction of competing products and technologies much easier. Policy changes, including potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the ACA or the implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to the health care system, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will stay in effect through 2030, unless additional congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nMore recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the U.S. to control the rising cost of healthcare. For example, such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and federal and state legislative activity designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of President Trump\u2019s importation executive order, which directed HHS to finalize the Canadian drug importation proposed rule previously issued by HHS and make other changes allowing for personal importation of drugs from Canada. The FDA final rule provides guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. State legislatures are also increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control the cost of healthcare, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of health reform initiatives that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, particularly as a result of the recent presidential election. We expect that additional U.S federal and state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Government Contracts\nA significant portion of the funding for the development of the red blood cell system is expected to come from our BARDA agreement, and if BARDA were to eliminate, reduce, delay, or object to extensions for funding from our agreement, this could have a significant, negative impact on our revenues and cash flows, and we may be forced to suspend or terminate our U.S. red blood cell development program or obtain alternative sources of funding.\nWe anticipate that a significant portion of the funding for the development of the red blood cell system will come from our agreement with BARDA. The agreement, including its subsequent modifications, provide for reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by us for up to approximately $213.9 million to support the development of the red blood cell system. However, our agreement with BARDA only reimburses certain specified development and clinical activities that have been authorized by BARDA pursuant to the base period and certain options of the agreement and the potential exercise of subsequent option periods. To date, BARDA has exercised approximately $116.9 million under the base period of the agreement and associated options. Accordingly, our ability to receive any of the unexercised $97.0 million in additional funding provided for under the BARDA agreement is dependent on BARDA exercising additional options under the agreement, which it may do or not do at its sole discretion. In addition, BARDA is entitled to terminate our BARDA agreement for convenience at any time, in whole or in part, and is not required to provide continued funding beyond reimbursement of amounts currently incurred and obligated by us as a result of contract performance. In addition, activities covered under the base period and exercised options may ultimately cost more than is covered by the BARDA contract and will likely require a longer performance period to complete than is remaining on our agreement; if we are unable to secure additional\nfunding or allow for additional time for completion, we would have to bear the cost to complete the activities or terminate the activities before completion. Moreover, the continuation of our BARDA agreement depends in large part on our ability to meet development milestones previously agreed to with BARDA and on our compliance with certain operating procedures and protocols. BARDA may suspend or terminate the agreement should we fail to achieve key milestones, or fail to comply with the operating procedures and processes approved by BARDA and its audit agency. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these milestones or continue to comply with these procedures and protocols. For instance, our RedeS and ReCePI studies, which are being funded as part of our agreement with BARDA, have been temporarily suspended at some of our hospital clinical sites and blood centers producing INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the studies are being conducted in areas that are also subject to disruption due to severe weather such as flooding or hurricane. The uncertainty regarding the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on participating blood centers, hospitals and their patients, severe weather or other natural disaster impacts to sites enrolling our clinical trials may all negatively impact our ability to complete our clinical trials. Our ability to meet the expectations of BARDA under our contract is largely dependent on our ability to attract, hire and retain personnel with competencies that are in short supply. In addition, in many instances we must identify third-party suppliers, negotiate terms acceptable to us and BARDA and ensure ongoing compliance by these suppliers with the obligations covered by our BARDA agreement. If we are unable to provide adequate supplier oversight or if suppliers are unable to comply with the requirements of the agreement, our ability to meet the anticipated milestones may be impaired. There can also be no assurance that our BARDA agreement will not be terminated, that our BARDA agreement will be extended for existing exercised options or through the exercise of subsequent option periods, that any such extensions would be on terms favorable to us, or that we will otherwise obtain the funding that we anticipate to obtain under our agreement with BARDA. Moreover, changes in government budgets and agendas may result in a decreased and deprioritized emphasis on supporting the development of pathogen reduction technology. While BARDA has provided funding for and has indicated a potential for future funding for many activities associated with combating COVID-19, the availability and focus for any BARDA funding will likely be finite and may require us to compete with other technologies, both similar and disparate. If our BARDA agreement is terminated or suspended, if there is any reduction or delay in funding under our BARDA agreement, or if BARDA determines not to exercise some or all of the options provided for under the agreement, our revenues and cash flows would be significantly and negatively impacted and we may be forced to seek alternative sources of funding, which may not be available on non-dilutive terms, terms favorable to us or at all. If alternative sources of funding are not available, we may be forced to suspend or terminate development activities related to the red blood cell system in the U.S. Furthermore, should we be unable to deploy personnel or derive a benefit from fixed study costs or generate data from clinical sites and studies reimbursed by BARDA, our cash flows would be negatively impacted or we may have to initiate furloughs and layoffs which would likely prove disruptive to our management and operations. This in turn would impair our ability to recommence and complete studies if and when the COVID-19 crisis subsides and we are able to restart many suspended or delayed activities.\nIn addition, under the BARDA agreement, BARDA will regularly review our development efforts and clinical activities. Under certain circumstances, BARDA may advise us to delay certain activities and invest additional time and resources before proceeding. If we follow such BARDA advice, overall red blood cell program delays and costs associated with additional resources for which we had not planned may result. Also, the costs associated with following such advice may or may not be reimbursed by BARDA under our agreement. Finally, we may decide not to follow the advice provided by BARDA and instead pursue activities that we believe are in the best interests of our red blood cell program and our business, even if BARDA would not reimburse us under our agreement.\nUnfavorable provisions in government contracts, including in our contract with BARDA, may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nU.S. government contracts typically contain unfavorable provisions and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion, which will subject us to additional risks. For example, under our agreement with BARDA, the U.S. government has the power to unilaterally:\n\u2022\naudit and object to any BARDA agreement-related costs and fees on grounds that they are not allowable under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, and require us to reimburse all such costs and fees\n\u2022\n\u200asuspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or grants or extending our existing agreement based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u2022\n\u200aclaim nonexclusive, nontransferable rights to product manufactured and intellectual property developed under the BARDA agreement and may, under certain circumstances involving public health and safety, license such inventions to third parties without our consent;\n\u2022\ncancel, terminate or suspend our BARDA agreement based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations;\n\u2022\n\u200aterminate our BARDA agreement in whole or in part for the convenience of the government for any reason or no reason, including if funds become unavailable to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response;\n\u2022\nreduce the scope and value of our BARDA agreement;\n\u2022\ndecline to exercise an option to continue the BARDA agreement;\n\u2022\ndirect the course of the development of the red blood cell system in a manner not chosen by us;\n\u2022\nrequire us to perform the option periods provided for under the BARDA agreement even if doing so may cause us to forego or delay the pursuit of other red blood cell program opportunities with greater commercial potential;\n\u2022\ntake actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected;\n\u2022\n\u200alimit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for the red blood cell program even after it has been funded for an initial period; and\n\u2022\nchange certain terms and conditions in our BARDA agreement.\nGenerally, government contracts, including our agreement with BARDA, contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the U.S. government\u2019s convenience. Termination-for-convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed (plus a portion of the agreed fee) and settlement expenses on the work completed prior to termination. Except for the amount of services received by the government, termination-for-default provisions do not permit recovery of fees. In addition, in the event of termination or upon expiration of our BARDA agreement, the U.S. government may dispute wind-down and termination costs and may question prior expenses under the contract and deny payment of those expenses. Should we choose to challenge the U.S. government for denying certain payments under our BARDA agreement, such a challenge could subject us to substantial additional expenses that we may or may not recover. Further, if our BARDA agreement is terminated for convenience, or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms, a significant negative impact on our cash flows and operations could result.\nIn addition, government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts;\n\u2022\nmandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022\npublic disclosures of certain contract information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program;\n\u2022\nmandatory internal control systems and policies; and\n\u2022\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, we may be subject to potential liability and to the termination of our BARDA agreement.\nFurthermore, we have entered into and will continue to enter into agreements and subcontracts with third parties, including suppliers, consultants and other third-party contractors, in order to satisfy our contractual obligations under our BARDA agreement. Negotiating and entering into such arrangements can be time-consuming and we may not be able to reach agreement with such third parties. Any such agreement must also be compliant with the terms of our BARDA agreement. Any delay or inability to enter into such arrangements or entering into such arrangements in a manner that is non-compliant with the terms of our contract, may result in violations of our BARDA agreement.\nAs a result of the unfavorable provisions in our BARDA agreement, we must undertake significant compliance activities. The diversion of resources from our development and commercial programs to these compliance activities, as well as the exercise by the U.S. government of any rights under these provisions, could materially harm our business.\nLaws and regulations affecting government contracts, including our BARDA agreement, make it more costly and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and adversely affect our business.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the administration and performance of our agreements. Among the most significant government contracting regulations are:\n\u2022\nthe FAR and agency-specific regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nexport and import control laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nIn addition, as a U.S. government contractor, we are required to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards relating to our accounting practices and are subject to periodic audits and reviews. As part of any such audit or review, the U.S. government may review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Based on the results of its audits, the U.S. government may adjust our agreement-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. This adjustment could impact the amount of revenues reported on a historic basis and could impact our cash flows under the contract prospectively. In addition, in the event that the government determines that certain costs and fees were unallowable or determines that the allocated indirect cost rate was higher than the actual indirect cost rate, the government would be entitled to recoup any overpayment from us as a result. In addition, if an audit or review uncovers any improper or illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of our agreements, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, under U.S. government purchasing regulations, some of our costs may not be reimbursable or allowed under our contracts. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities as compared to private sector commercial companies.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to market, sell, distribute and maintain our products and to maintain customer relationships in certain countries.\nWe have entered into distribution agreements, generally on a geographically exclusive basis, with distributors in certain regions. We rely on these distributors to obtain and maintain any necessary in-country regulatory approvals, as well as market and sell the INTERCEPT Blood System, provide customer and technical product support, maintain inventories, and adhere to our quality system in all material respects, among other activities. Generally, our distribution agreements require distributors to purchase minimum quantities in a given year over the term of the agreement. Failure by our distributors to meet these minimum purchase obligations may impact our financial results. In addition, failure by our distributors to provide an accurate forecast impacts our ability to predict the timing of product revenue and our ability to accurately forecast our product supply needs. While our contracts generally require distributors to exercise diligence, these distributors may fail to commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System in their respective territories. For example, our distributors may fail to sell product inventory they have purchased from us to end customers or may sell competing products ahead of or in conjunction with INTERCEPT. In addition, initial purchases of illuminators or INTERCEPT disposable kits by these third parties may not lead to follow-on purchases of platelet and plasma systems\u2019 disposable kits. We have a finite number of illuminators that can be produced under the current approved configuration before a redesigned and approved illuminator is available. Should we sell illuminators to distributors or other customers without follow-on purchases of disposable kits, our revenue potential will be impaired. Agreements with our distributors typically require the distributor to maintain quality standards that are compliant with standards generally accepted for medical devices. We may be unable to ensure that our distributors are compliant with such standards. Further, we have limited visibility into the identity and requirements of blood banking customers these distributors may have. Accordingly, we may be unable to ensure our distributors properly maintain illuminators sold or provide quality technical services to the blood banking customers to which they sell. In addition, although our agreements with our distributors generally require compliance with local anti-corruption laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local and international regulations, we have limited ability to control the actions of our distributors to ensure they are in compliance. Noncompliance by a distributor could expose us to civil or criminal liability, fines and/or prohibitions on selling our products in certain countries.\nCurrently, a fairly concentrated number of distributors make up a significant portion of our product revenue and we may have little recourse, short of termination, in the event that a distributor fails to execute according to our expectations and contractual provisions.\nIn the past, we have experienced weaker than expected growth due to declining performance by certain of our distributors. Periodically, we transition certain territories to new distribution partners or our direct sales force where we believe we can improve performance relative to the distributor. Because new distribution partners or our direct sales force may have limited experience marketing and selling our products in certain territories, or at all, we cannot be certain that they will perform better than the predecessor distributor. In certain cases, our distributors hold the regulatory approval to sell INTERCEPT for their particular geography. Termination, loss of exclusivity or transitioning from these distributors may require us to negotiate a transfer of the applicable regulatory approvals to us or new distributors which may be difficult to do in a timely manner, or at all. We expect that our product revenue will be adversely impacted with the loss or transition of one or more of these distributors. If we choose to terminate distributor agreements, we would either need to reach agreement with, qualify, train and supply a replacement distributor or supply and service end-user customer accounts in those territories ourselves. Although our distribution agreements generally provide that the distributor will promptly and efficiently transfer its existing customer agreements to us, there can be no assurance that this will happen in a timely manner or at all or that the distributor will honor its outstanding commitments to us. In addition, terminated distributors may own illuminators placed at customer sites and may necessitate us to repurchase those devices or require end-user customers to purchase new devices from us. Additionally, we may need terminated distributors to cooperate with us or a new distributor in transitioning sub-distributor relationships and contracts, hospital contracts, public tenders, or regulatory certificates or licenses held in their name. These factors may be disruptive for our customers and our reputation may be damaged as a result. Our distribution partners may have more established relationships with potential end user customers than a new distributor or we may have in particular territory, which could adversely impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products in these territories. In addition, it may take longer for us to be paid if payment timing and terms in these new arrangements are less favorable to us than those in our existing distributor arrangements. As we service end-user accounts directly rather than through distributors, we incur additional expense, our working capital is negatively impacted due to longer periods from cash collection from direct sales customers when compared to the timing of cash collection from our former distribution partners and we may be exposed to additional complexity including local statutory and tax compliance. Current or transitioning distributors may irreparably harm relationships with local existing and prospective customers and our standing with the blood banking community in general. In the event that we are unable to find alternative distributors or mobilize our own sales efforts in the territories in which a particular distributor operates, customer supply, our reputation and our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, in territories where new distributors are responsible for servicing end-user accounts, there will be a period of transition in order to properly qualify and train these new distributors, which may disrupt the operations of our customers and adversely impact our reputation and operating results. Furthermore, there may be local or regional restrictions on travel due to the COVID-19 crisis, which could impact our distributors or our ability to service customers in the field should issues arise. In certain cases where a terminated distributor holds title to illuminators placed in the field, we may choose to buy back the illuminators from the distributor to ensure continuity of service to those customers. If this were to occur, our recognizable revenue would be negatively impacted.\nOur manufacturing supply chain exposes us to significant risks.\nWe do not own our own manufacturing facilities, but rather manufacture our products using a number of third-party suppliers, many of whom are our sole suppliers for the particular product or component that we procure. We rely on various contracts and our relationships with these suppliers to ensure that the sourced products are manufactured in sufficient quantities, timely, to our exact specifications and at prices we agree upon with the supplier. The price that we pay to some of our suppliers is dependent on the volume of products or components that we order. If we are unable to meet the volume tiers that afford the most favorable pricing, our gross margins will be negatively impacted. Until we either expand the number of manufacturing partners producing PRCFC for us, or our manufacturing partners for PRCFC receive approval of their BLAs, we are reliant on the manufacturing partners in the four states in which they are located to maintain their licenses to manufacture PRCFC, manufacture such products in accordance with the applicable specifications and deliver products timely to our hospital customers. In addition, our blood center manufacturing partners for PRCFC may not be able to produce a sufficient quantity of PRCFC to meet customer demand. Accordingly, we may choose to sell INTERCEPT for cryoprecipitation disposable kits to blood centers that are not manufacturing PRCFC for us. Additionally, because PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced are products derived from our INTERCEPT Blood System for plasma, any supply disruptions or failures that could impact our plasma system will have a negative direct impact on the production of PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced.\nIn October 2015, we amended and restated our manufacturing and supply agreement with Fresenius. In December 2020, we further amended the agreement to set the pricing for 2021, among other items. Under the amended agreement, Fresenius is obligated to sell, and we are obligated to purchase finished disposable kits for the platelet, plasma and red blood cell kits from Fresenius with certain exceptions permitted. The initial term of the amended agreement extends through July 1, 2025, and is automatically renewed thereafter for additional two-year renewal terms, subject to termination by either party upon (i) two years written notice prior to the expiration of the initial term or (ii) one year written notice prior to the expiration of any renewal term. We and Fresenius each have normal and customary termination rights, including termination for material breach. Fresenius is our sole supplier for the manufacture of these products, although we are currently working with Fresenius to identify and qualify additional sites for the production of components and of finished disposable kits. Fresenius may fail to manufacture an adequate supply of INTERCEPT disposable kits which would harm our business. Disruptions to our supply chain as a result of any potential ensuing protests, strikes or other work-\nstoppages would be detrimental to our business and operating results. In the event Fresenius refuses or is unable to continue operating under the agreement, we may be unable to maintain inventory levels or otherwise meet customer demand, and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also have contracts with other third-party suppliers, including Ash Stevens for the manufacture of amotosalen, our proprietary compound for reducing pathogens that is used in our platelet and plasma systems; Purolite, and separately, Porex, for the manufacture of components of the compound adsorption devices used in our platelet and plasma systems; and Nova for the manufacture of illuminators and certain components of the INTERCEPT Blood System. These independent suppliers are currently our sole qualified suppliers for such components and products.\nOur manufacturing and supply agreement with Ash Stevens continues until December 31, 2021, and will continue to automatically renew thereafter for periods of two years each, but may be terminated by Ash Stevens provided that Ash Stevens notifies us in writing at least two years in advance. We have not been notified by Ash Stevens of their intention to terminate the agreement.\nIn April 2017, we entered into an amended and restated manufacturing and supply agreement with Porex for the continued supply of the compound adsorption devices. Porex is our sole supplier for certain components of and manufacturing of the compound adsorption devices. Under the amended and restated Porex agreement, we are no longer subject to a minimum annual purchase requirement; however, Porex has the right to terminate the agreement, upon 12 months\u2019 prior written notice, if annual production falls below a mutually agreed threshold. The amended and restated Porex agreement was renewed as of January 1, 2020, for an additional two years. In December 2020, we reached agreement with Porex regarding pricing for 2021, consistent with the process set forth in the original agreement. In addition, we entered into an amended and restated supply agreement with Brotech Corporation d/b/a Purolite Company, or Purolite, for the supply of raw materials used to make the compound adsorption devices. The amended supply agreement expires in February 2023 and will automatically renew for an additional year unless either party has provided notice not to renew at least two years prior to the expiration. Under the terms of the amended agreement, pricing is volume based and is subject to annual, prospective adjustments based on a Producer Price Index subject to an annual cap. Our agreement with Nova, which manufacturers our illuminators, currently extends through September 2021 and is automatically renewable for one year terms, but may be terminated by Nova on at least 12 months\u2019 prior written notice. We have not been notified by Nova of their intention to terminate the agreement.\nFacilities at which the INTERCEPT Blood System or its components are manufactured may cease operations for planned or unplanned reasons or may unilaterally change the formulations of certain commercially available reagents that we use, causing at least temporary interruptions in supply. In addition, given our recent rapid growth and potential for continued or even accelerated growth, we may need to identify, validate and qualify additional manufacturing capacity with existing or new suppliers. Further, customer demand for our platelet kits may fully utilize the production capacity of our third-party manufacturer(s), as a result we may need to allocate manufacturing resources such that our supply of platelet kits or plasma kits could be adversely impacted. Even a temporary failure to supply adequate numbers of INTERCEPT Blood System components may cause an irreparable loss of customer goodwill and potentially irreversible loss of momentum in the marketplace. In addition, while our suppliers have initiated business continuity plans with minimal disruption to our supply, we cannot be certain that any prolonged, intensified, worsened, or recurring effect from the COVID-19 pandemic would not impact our supply chain. Although we are actively evaluating alternate suppliers and additional sites within our existing supplier\u2019s networks for certain components, we do not have qualified additional sites or suppliers or capacity beyond those on which we currently rely, and we understand that Fresenius relies substantially on sole suppliers of certain materials for our products. In addition, suppliers from whom our contract manufacturers source components and raw materials may cease production or supply of those components to our contract manufacturers. For example, we understand that a compound adsorbent housing component is no longer available and an alternate housing will need to be qualified by Fresenius. Identification and qualification of alternate suppliers is time consuming and costly, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to demonstrate equivalency of alternate components or suppliers or that we will receive regulatory approval in the U.S. or other jurisdictions. If we conclude that supply of the INTERCEPT Blood System or components from suppliers is uncertain, we may choose to build and maintain inventories of raw materials, work-in-process components, or finished goods, which would consume capital resources faster than we anticipate and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient.\nCurrently Nova is manufacturing illuminators to meet customer demand and maintain our own inventory levels. Subject to obsolescence, we may be required to identify and qualify replacement components for illuminators and in doing so, we may be required to conduct additional studies, which could include clinical trials to demonstrate equivalency or validate any required design or component changes. We and our customers rely on the availability of spare parts to ensure that customer platelet and plasma production is not interrupted. If we are not able to supply spare parts for the maintenance of customer illuminators, our ability to keep existing customers, increase production for existing customers or sign up new customers may be negatively impacted. We are currently redesigning the illuminator which is expected to take several years. We will need to obtain regulatory approval for the redesigned illuminator before it can be commercialized in the U.S. or under CE Mark. Our failure to obtain regulatory approvals of a new illuminator could constrain our ability to penetrate our markets and may otherwise significantly limit product revenue from sales of the platelet and plasma systems. In any event, delays in receipt or failure to receive these approvals could reduce our sales and negatively impact our profitability potential and future growth prospects. Furthermore, we understand that components used in the\nilluminator are no longer commercially available beyond what we and Nova have stockpiled or to which we have access under final buy transactions or may become unavailable in the current specifications in the near-term. As with our disposable sets, if we conclude that supply of components or spare parts for the illuminators is uncertain, we may choose to purchase and maintain inventories of such components or spare parts, which would consume capital resources faster than we anticipate and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient. We are and will need to continue investing in subsequent versions of the illuminator to enhance functionality and manage obsolescence. In addition, our illuminators contain embedded proprietary software that runs on software code we have developed and that we own. Changes to certain components due to obsolescence, illuminator redesign or market demand, may require us to modify the existing software code or to develop new illuminator software. Our ability to develop new illuminator software, correct coding flaws and generally maintain the software code is reliant on third-party contractors who, in some cases, have sole knowledge of the software code. Our ability to develop and maintain the illuminator software may be impaired if we are not able to continue contracting with those key third-party contracted developers or if we are unable to source alternate employees or consultants to do so. Software development is inherently risky and may be time consuming and costly.\nIn the event that alternate manufacturers or alternate manufacturing sites are identified and qualified, we will need to transfer know-how relevant to the manufacture of the INTERCEPT Blood System to such alternate manufacturers and manufacturing sites; however, certain of our supplier\u2019s materials, manufacturing processes and methods are proprietary to them, which will impair our ability to establish alternate sources of supply, even if we are required to do so as a condition of regulatory approval. We may be unable to establish alternate suppliers without having to redesign certain elements of the platelet and plasma systems. Such redesign may be costly, time consuming and require further regulatory review and approvals. We may be unable to identify, select, and qualify such manufacturers or those third parties able to provide support for development and testing activities on a timely basis or enter into contracts with them on reasonable terms, if at all.\nMoreover, the inclusion of components manufactured by new suppliers or by alternate sites within our current network of suppliers could require us to seek new or updated approvals from regulatory authorities, which could result in delays in product delivery. We may not receive any such required regulatory approvals. We cannot assure you that any amendments to existing manufacturing agreements or any new manufacturing agreements that we may enter into will contain terms more favorable to us than those that we currently have with our manufacturers. Many of the existing agreements we have with suppliers contain provisions that we have been operating under for an extended period of time, including pricing. Should we enter into agreements or amend agreements with any manufacturer with less favorable terms, including pricing, our results of operations may be impacted, our recourse against such manufacturers may be limited, and the quality of our products may be impacted.\nRaw materials, components or finished product may not meet specifications or may be subject to other nonconformities. In the past, non-conformities in certain component lots have caused delays in manufacturing of INTERCEPT disposable kits. Similarly, we have experienced non-conformities and out of specification results in certain component manufacturing needed for clinical use, commercial sale and regulatory submissions. Non-conformities can increase our expenses and reduce gross margins or result in delayed regulatory submissions or clinical trials. For example, in September 2020, we learned that certain components which we source from Purolite and Porex did not pass quality standards despite testing. The quality failure in manufacturing by the suppliers resulted in a significant write down and impact to our reported gross margins. Should non-conformities occur in the future, we may be unable to manufacture products to support our red blood cell clinical trials, or to meet customer demand for our commercial products, which would result in delays for our clinical programs, or lost sales for our commercial products, and could cause irreparable damage to our customer relationships. Later discovery of problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in additional restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. We are subject to risks and costs of product recall, which include not only potential out-of-pocket costs, but also potential interruption to our supply chain. In such an event, our customer relations could be harmed and we would incur unforeseen losses.\nIn the event of a failure by Fresenius or other manufacturers to perform their obligations to supply kits, illuminators or components of the INTERCEPT Blood System to us, damages recoverable by us may be insufficient to compensate us for the full loss of business opportunity. Many of our supply agreements contain limitations on incidental and consequential damages that we may recover. A supplier\u2019s potential liability in the event of non-performance may not be sufficient to compel the supplier to continue to act in conformity with our agreements. Our product supply chain requires us to purchase certain components in minimum quantities and may result in a production cycle of more than one year. Significant disruptions to any of the steps in our supply chain process may result in longer productions cycles which could lead to inefficient use of cash or may impair our ability to supply customers with product.\nWe may encounter unforeseen manufacturing difficulties which, at a minimum, may lead to higher than anticipated costs, scrap rates, or delays in manufacturing products. In addition, we may not receive timely or accurate demand information from distributors or direct customers, or may not accurately forecast demand ourselves for the INTERCEPT Blood System. Should actual demand for our products exceed our own forecasts or forecasts that customers provide, we may be unable to fulfill such orders timely, if at all. Should we be unable to fulfill demand, particularly if mandated by a public health authority or as included in the FDA platelet safety guidance document, our reputation and business prospects may be impaired. Further, certain distributors and customers require, and potential\nfuture distributors or customers may require, product with a minimum shelf life. If customers requiring minimum shelf-lives order smaller quantities or do not purchase product as we anticipate, or at all, we may have elevated inventory levels with relatively short shelf-lives which may lead to increased write-offs and inefficient use of our cash. Should we choose not to fulfill smaller orders with minimum shelf lives, our product sales may be harmed. We will need to destroy or consume outdated inventory in product demonstration activities, which may in turn lead to elevated product demonstration costs and/or reduced gross margins. In order to meet minimum shelf-life requirements, we may need to manufacture sufficient product to meet estimated forecasted demand. As a result, we may carry excess work-in-process or finished goods inventory, which would consume capital resources and may become obsolete, or our inventory may be inadequate to meet customer demand. Our platelet and plasma systems\u2019 disposable kits have 18 to 24 months shelf lives from the date of manufacture. Should we change or modify any of our product configurations or components, such future configurations of our products may not achieve the same shelf life that existing products have. We and our distributors may be unable to ship product to customers prior to the expiration of the product shelf life, a risk that is heightened if we elect to increase our inventory levels in order to mitigate supply disruptions. We have entered into certain public tenders, some of which call for us to maintain certain minimum levels of inventory. If our suppliers fail to produce components or our finished products satisfactorily, timely, at acceptable costs, and in sufficient quantities, we may incur delays, shortfalls and additional expenses, or non-compliance with certain public tenders which may in turn result in penalty fees, permanent harm to our customer relations or loss of customers. In addition, certain large national prospective customers, like those in the U.K. or Japan, may choose to convert all of their operation to INTERCEPT. Should we or our suppliers encounter any manufacturing issues, we may not be able to satisfy all of the global demand or may have to allocate available product to certain customers which may negatively impact our customers operations and consequently, our reputation. Conversely, we may choose to overstock inventory in order to mitigate any unforeseen potential disruption to manufacturing which could consume our cash resources faster than we anticipate and may cause our supply chain to be less efficient. Additionally, should we conclude that existing suppliers are not able to produce sufficient quantities to meet the demand for our products, we may choose to invest in manufacturing capacity at existing or new facilities with existing or new suppliers, which could be costly and disruptive to our management.\nWe currently have no experience with customer expectations regarding turnover or inventory levels of PRCFC held at either our blood center manufacturing partners or at the hospitals themselves. Our PRCFC product has a shelf life of five days from thaw before it expires. To mitigate product expiration, should hospitals require that we use a consigned inventory model whereby unused product at the hospital at expiration is replaced with fresh product at reduced to no cost to the hospital, we may need to keep additional inventory or manufacture PRCFC above levels generating an economic return.\nCertain regions that we sell into or may sell into in the future may give priority to those products that are manufactured locally in their jurisdiction. Our failure to meet these local manufacturing conditions may prevent us from successfully commercializing our product in those geographies. In addition, should we choose to manufacture locally in those jurisdictions, we would likely incur additional costs, may be unable to meet our quality system requirements or successfully manufacture products, and such activities will be a distraction from our current focus and operations. We have no experience manufacturing or working with manufacturers outside of our current manufacturing footprint.\nObsolescence or shortage of raw materials, key components of and accessories to the INTERCEPT Blood System, may impact our ability to supply our customers, may negatively impact the operational costs of our customers and may increase the prices at which we sell our products, resulting in slower than anticipated growth or negative future financial performance.\nThe manufacture, supply and availability of key components of, and accessories to, our products are dependent upon a limited number of third parties and the commercial adoption and success of our products is dependent upon the continued availability of these components or accessories. For example, our customers rely on continued availability of third-party supplied plastics, saline and reagents for processing, storing and manufacturing blood components. If the blood product industry experiences shortages of these components or accessories, the availability and use of our products may be impaired.\nWith respect to the manufacture of our products, our third-party manufacturers source components and raw materials for the manufacture of the INTERCEPT processing sets. Certain of these components are no longer commercially available, are nearing end-of-life or are available only from a limited number of suppliers. We and our third-party manufacturers do not have guaranteed supply contracts with all of the raw material or component suppliers for our products, which magnify the risk of shortage and obsolescence and decreases our manufacturers\u2019 ability to negotiate pricing with their suppliers. For example, a solvent used in the manufacture of a raw material for our plasma compound adsorption device may no longer be available. Although we have contracted with the manufacturer to produce a significant quantity of the existing material, we will need to qualify plastic beads produced with a new solvent prior to consuming available inventory levels. In any event, the amount of material is finite and we and our contract manufacturer may need to qualify an alternate solvent used in the manufacture of the raw material or build sufficient levels of inventory until we can redesign our products. If we are unable to use all of the raw material produced during the final production run, or if the final material produces suboptimal results, we may require customers to modify their operating practices, or run out of material before an alternate material can be qualified. Customers may object to changes in operating practices or changes to the instructions for use, and a potential negative impact on their operations as a result of the use of this material, could impair our\nreputation or customer acceptance of our products. Any shortage or obsolescence of raw materials, components or accessories or our inability to control costs associated with raw materials, components or accessories, could increase our costs to manufacture our products. Further, if any supplier to our third-party manufacturers is unwilling or unable to provide high quality raw materials in required quantities and at acceptable prices, our manufacturers may be unable to find alternative sources or may fail to find alternative suppliers at commercially acceptable prices, on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, we do not yet know whether or not certain components used by blood center operators or used in the production of INTERCEPT will be able to successfully comply with the new standards under the MDR. Failure to comply with the new standards timely may result in a disruption to blood center operations or the manufacture of the INTERCEPT Blood System. If any of these events were to occur, our product quality, competitive position, reputation and business could suffer, we could experience cancellations of customer orders, refusal by customers to accept deliveries or a reduction in our prices and margins to the detriment of our financial performance and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe expect to continue to generate losses.\nWe may never achieve a profitable level of operations. Our cost of product sold, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses have resulted in substantial losses since our inception. The platelet and plasma systems have been approved in the U.S. only since December 2014 and are not approved in many countries around the world. Similarly, our PMA supplement for the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation to produce PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced was approved in November 2020 in the U.S. and is not approved anywhere else in the world. We plan to begin selling PRCFC to hospital customers in a limited launch in the U.S. beginning in 2021. The red blood cell system is in the development stage and may never emerge from the development stage as a marketed product. We may be required to reduce the sales price for our products in order to make our products economically attractive to our customers and to governmental and private payors, or to compete favorably with other blood safety interventions or other pathogen reduction technologies, which may reduce or altogether eliminate any gross profit on sales. At our present and expected 2021 sales levels of the platelet and plasma systems, and of PRCFC, our costs to manufacture, distribute, market, sell, support the systems and develop new products are and are expected to continue to be in excess of our product revenue. We expect our losses to continue at least until we are able to gain widespread commercial adoption, which may never occur. To prepare for commercial launch of PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduce, we have begun to hire employees and are looking to retain additional contract resources to sell PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced directly to hospitals and may choose to sell INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation disposable kits to blood centers that are not contracted with us as manufacturing partners. We expect to incur additional research and development costs associated with the development of different configurations of existing product candidates and products and our illuminator, development of new products, planning, enrolling and completing ongoing clinical and non-clinical studies, including the post-approval studies we are required to conduct in connection with the FDA approval of the platelet system, pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our platelet and plasma systems, planning and conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., and completing activities to support a potential CE Mark approval for our red blood cell system in Europe. These costs could be substantial and could extend the period during which we expect to operate at a loss, particularly if we experience any difficulties or delays in completing the activities. Presently, we anticipate that the stress of COVID-19 on healthcare systems around the globe may negatively impact our ability to conduct clinical trials in the near term due primarily to the lack of resources at clinical trial sites and the resulting challenge to enroll patients in these trials. For example, for a brief time, several of the hospital clinical trial sites for our RedeS and ReCePI studies suspended enrollment and several red blood cell production partners for the studies suspended production in order to conserve red blood cells to meet hospital demand during the pandemic. The timing of other planned clinical trials has also been delayed due to the pandemic. Many hospital sites have not yet resumed enrollment and those that have are proceeding at a reduced capacity. Further delays may recur in the future, if patient enrollment sites need to pause participation in our clinical trials and studies and we cannot be certain that further disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic can be avoided.\nIn certain countries, governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of medical products and medical product companies. Healthcare reform in the U.S. has also placed downward pressure on the pricing of medical products that could have a negative impact on our profit margins.\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our future operations or if we are unable to generate positive cash flows from our operations, we will need to curtail planned development or sales and commercialization activities.\nOur near-term capital requirements are dependent on various factors, including operating costs and working capital investments associated with commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System, including in connection with the continuing U.S. commercialization of our platelet and plasma systems and the anticipated launch of PRCFC and its derivative product, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced, costs to develop different configurations of existing products and new products, including our illuminator, costs associated with planning, enrolling and completing ongoing studies, and the post-approval studies we may be required to\nconduct to satisfy regulators or achieve broader market acceptance, costs associated with pursuing potential regulatory approvals in other geographies where we do not currently sell our products, costs associated with conducting in vitro studies and clinical development of our red blood cell system in Europe and the U.S., costs associated with performing the agreed-upon activities under our BARDA agreement, and costs related to creating, maintaining and defending our intellectual property. Our long-term capital requirements will also be dependent on the success of our sales efforts, competitive developments, the timing, costs and magnitude of our longer-term clinical trials and other development activities, required post-approval studies, market preparedness and product launch activities for any of our product candidates and products in geographies where we do not currently sell our products, and regulatory factors. Until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and generate positive net cash flows from operations, which we may never do, meeting our long-term capital requirements is in large part reliant on continued access to funds under our BARDA agreement and the public and private equity and debt capital markets, as well as on collaborative arrangements with partners, augmented by cash generated from operations and interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances. While we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, if we are unable to generate sufficient product revenue, or access sufficient funds under our BARDA agreement or the public and private equity and debt capital markets, we may be unable to execute successfully on our operating plan. We have based our cash sufficiency estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, we could consume our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect or in excess of amounts than we currently expect, which could adversely affect our commercialization and clinical development activities.\nWe have borrowed and in the future may borrow additional capital from institutional and commercial banking sources to fund future growth, including pursuant to our Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (Term Loan), or the Term Loan Credit Agreement, and our Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (Revolving Loan), or the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, both with MidCap Financial Trust, or MidCap, as described below, or potentially pursuant to new arrangements with different lenders. We may borrow funds on terms that may include restrictive covenants, including covenants that restrict the operation of our business, liens on assets, high effective interest rates, financial performance covenants and repayment provisions that reduce cash resources and limit future access to capital markets. In addition, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to the equity capital markets to support our development efforts and operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration or partnering arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or rights to market and sell our products in certain geographies, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, or issue equity that may be substantially dilutive to our stockholders.\nWhile we expect to receive significant funding under our agreement with BARDA, our ability to obtain the funding we expect to receive under the agreement is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including with respect to BARDA\u2019s ability to terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and our ability to achieve the required milestones under the agreement, including with respect to the conduct of the RedeS and ReCePI studies, enrollment for which have been suspended at many of the hospital sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many hospital sites where enrollment was suspended have not yet resumed enrollment and those that have are proceeding at a reduced capacity. Accordingly, many of the activities expected by BARDA have been delayed and will require an extension of time under the contract to complete. Should BARDA disallow any extension, we will need to pay for the costs to complete the activities or stop pursuing them altogether. In addition, access to federal contracts is subject to the authorization of funds and approval of our research plans by various organizations within the federal government, including the U.S. Congress. The general economic environment and uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with tight federal budgets, has led to a general decline in the amount available for government funding. If BARDA were to eliminate, reduce or delay funding under our agreement, this would have a significant negative impact on the programs associated with such funding and could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and cash flows. Furthermore, should we be unable to deploy personnel or derive a benefit from fixed study costs or generate data from clinical sites and studies reimbursed by BARDA, our cash flows would be negatively impacted or we may have to initiate furloughs and layoffs. This in turn would impair our ability to recommence and complete studies if and when the COVID-19 crisis subsides and we are able to restart many suspended or delayed activities. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient prerequisite Phase 3 clinical data, our agreement with BARDA will be severely limited in scope or could be terminated altogether, and our ability to complete the development activities required for licensure in the U.S. may require additional capital beyond which we currently have. While BARDA has provided funding for and has indicated a potential for future funding for many activities associated with combating COVID-19, the availability and focus for any BARDA funding will likely be finite and may require us to compete with other technologies, both similar and disparate. If alternative sources of funding are not available, we may be forced to suspend or terminate development activities related to the red blood cell system in the U.S.\nAs a result of economic conditions, general global economic uncertainty, political change, and other factors, including uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will be able to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted global financial markets, and may limit our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. If we are unable to raise additional capital due to the volatile global financial markets, general economic uncertainty or other factors, we may need to curtail planned development or commercialization activities. In addition, we may need to obtain additional funds to complete development activities for the red blood cell system if additional studies are necessary for regulatory approval in Europe, which would increase our costs and potentially delay the approval. We may need to obtain additional funding to conduct additional randomized controlled clinical trials for existing or new products, particularly if we are unable to access any additional portions of the\nfunding contemplated by our BARDA agreement, and we may choose to defer such activities until we can obtain sufficient additional funding or, at such time, our existing operations provide sufficient cash flow to conduct these trials.\nCovenants in our Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Loan Credit Agreement restrict our business and operations in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our operations may not provide sufficient cash to meet the repayment obligations of our debt incurred under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness under our Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Loan Credit Agreement was approximately $48.1 million. All of our current and future assets, except for intellectual property and 35% of our investment in our subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., are secured for our borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Loan Credit Agreement require that we comply with certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiary, including among other things, covenants restricting dispositions, changes in business, management, ownership or business locations, mergers or acquisitions, indebtedness, encumbrances, distributions, investments, transactions with affiliates and subordinated debt, any of which could restrict our business and operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions to take advantage of certain business opportunities that may be presented to us. In addition, receipt of a qualified audit opinion (other than as to going concern or a qualification resulting solely from the scheduled maturity of term loans occurring within one year from the date such opinion is delivered) would be a violation of an affirmative covenant under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. While we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as cash to be received from product sales and under our agreement with BARDA, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, if we are unable to generate sufficient product revenue, or access sufficient funds under our BARDA agreement or the public and private equity and debt capital markets, we may be unable to execute successfully on our operating plan. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which could permit the lenders to declare all or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable, or to refuse to permit additional borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, which would seriously harm our business. In addition, should we be unable to comply with these or certain other covenants or if we default on any portion of our outstanding borrowings, the lenders can also impose an exit fee of a percentage of the amount borrowed pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nIf the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, is discontinued, interest payments under our Term Loan Credit Agreement or Revolving Loan Credit Agreement may be calculated using another reference rate.\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. Although there have been certain issuances utilizing SOFR, it is unknown whether this or any other alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. U.S. dollar LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate in our Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. There remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate, and any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on us are not known. The transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR and may result in increased borrowing costs, the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, uncertainty under applicable documentation, including our Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, or difficult and costly processes to amend such documentation. As a result, our ability to refinance our Term Loan Credit Agreement, Revolving Loan Credit Agreement or other indebtedness or to hedge our exposure to floating rate instruments may be impaired, which would adversely affect the operations of our business.\nRisks Related to Managing Our Growth and Other Risks\nIf we fail to attract, retain and motivate key personnel or to retain the members of our executive management team, our operations and our future growth may be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent upon our executive management team and other critical personnel, including our specialized research and development, regulatory and operations personnel, many of whom have been employed with us for many years and have a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance. If one or more members of our executive management team or other key personnel were to retire or resign, our ability to achieve development, regulatory or operational milestones for commercialization of our products could be adversely affected if we are unable to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. In addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. If knowledge transfer, recruiting and retention efforts are inadequate, significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us. Should our employees, notably laboratory-based personnel, see a surge in infections, our ability to complete research and development activities may be impaired. As\nsuch, certain studies and trials may be delayed for an extended period of time. Furthermore, key deployment and technical service personnel, if infected, will not be able to support customers timely or effectively which could negatively impact our ability to support customers looking to begin INTERCEPT use or those experiencing any operational difficulties. We do not yet know when our employees will have access to a vaccine or if such a vaccine will be effective.\nWe also rely on our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled and highly qualified personnel in order to grow our company. Competition for qualified personnel in the medical device and pharmaceutical industry is very intense. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate quality individuals, our business, financial condition, ability to perform under our BARDA agreement, or results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected. Even if we are able to identify and hire qualified personnel commensurate with our growth objectives and opportunities, the process of integrating new employees is time consuming, costly and distracting to existing employees and management. Such disruptions may have an adverse impact on our operations, our ability to service existing markets and customers, or our ability to comply with regulations and laws.\nAll of the employees of our subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., are employed outside the U.S., including in France, where labor and employment laws are relatively stringent and, in many cases, grant significant job protection to certain employees, including rights on termination of employment. In addition, one of our manufacturing partners that we are dependent on is located in France and may have employees that are members of unions or represented by a works council as required by law. These more stringent labor and employment laws to the extent that they are applicable, coupled with the requirement to consult with the relevant unions or works\u2019 councils, could increase our operational costs with respect to our own employees and could result in passed through operational costs by our manufacturing partner. If the increased operational costs become significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nAs our international operations grow, we may be subject to adverse fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, as well as to tariffs and other trade restrictions.\nOur international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business, including, among other factors, differing political, economic, and regulatory climates, different tax structures and foreign exchange volatility. We do not currently enter into any hedging contracts to normalize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. As a result, our future results could be materially affected by changes in these or other factors.\nProduct sales of the INTERCEPT Blood System sold outside of the U.S. are typically invoiced to customers in Euros. In addition, we purchase finished INTERCEPT disposable kits for our platelet and plasma systems and incur certain operating expenses in Euros and other foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility is a direct result of our product sales, cash collection and cash payments for expenses to support our international operations. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as a component of other income, net on our consolidated statements of operations. Significant fluctuations in the volatility of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may materially affect our results of operations. For example, the announcement of Brexit caused severe volatility in global currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we transact business. Should this foreign exchange volatility continue or increase, it could cause volatility in our results of operations. In addition, in a period where the U.S. dollar is strengthening/weakening as compared to Euros and other currencies we transact in, our product revenues and expenses denominated in Euros or other foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower/higher value than they would be in an otherwise constant currency exchange rate environment.\nCurrently we do not have a formal hedging program to mitigate the effects of foreign currency volatility. As our commercial operations grow globally, our operations are exposed to more currencies and as a result our exposure to foreign exchange risk will grow.\nAdditionally, the U.S. government has called for substantial changes to foreign trade policy and has recently imposed tariffs on certain U.S. imports. Canada, the E.U., China and other countries have responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. exports. We also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce. If we are subject to new regulations, including those under the Tax Act, or if restrictions and tariffs increase our operating costs in the future, and we are not able to recapture those costs from our customers, or if such initiatives, regulations, restrictions or tariffs make it more difficult for us to compete in overseas markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nVirtually all of our research and development activities and the significant majority of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from a single site that may be subject to lengthy business interruption in the event of a severe earthquake. We also may suffer loss of computerized information and may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems.\nVirtually all of our research and development activities and the significant portion of our general and administrative activities are performed in or managed from our facilities in Concord, California, which are within an active earthquake fault zone. Should a severe earthquake occur, we might be unable to occupy our facilities or conduct research and development and general and administrative activities in support of our business and products until such time as our facilities could be repaired and made operational. Our property and casualty and business interruption insurance in general does not cover losses caused by earthquakes. While we have taken certain measures to protect our scientific, technological and commercial assets, a lengthy or costly disruption due to an earthquake would\nhave a material adverse effect on us. We have also taken measures to limit damage that may occur from the loss of computerized data due to power outage, system or component failure or corruption of data files. However, we may lose critical computerized data, which may be difficult or impossible to recreate, which may harm our business. We may be unable to make timely filings with regulatory agencies in the event of catastrophic failure of our data storage and backup systems, which may subject us to fines or adverse consequences, up to and including loss of our ability to conduct business.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on complex and interdependent information technology systems, including internet-based systems, databases and programs, to support our business processes as well as internal and external communications. These include those that are used directly by our operations and those used by critical service providers and suppliers, including our manufacturing partners. As use of information technology systems has increased, deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks have increased in frequency and sophistication. Our and our supplier\u2019s information technology, systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses which may result in the impairment of production and key business processes or loss of data or information. We and our suppliers are also potentially vulnerable to data security breaches-whether by employees or others-which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. For example, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to \u201cphishing\u201d attacks in which third parties send emails purporting to be from reputable sources. Phishing attacks may attempt to obtain personal information, infiltrate our systems to initiate wire transfers or otherwise obtain proprietary or confidential information. Although we have not experienced any losses as a result of such attacks or any other breaches of data security, such breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, distributors, customers and others.\nWe may be subject to contractual requirements that obligate us to use industry-standard or reasonable measures to safeguard personal information. We also may be subject to laws that require us to use industry-standard or reasonable security measures to safeguard personal information. A security breach could lead to claims by our customers or other relevant stakeholders that we have failed to comply with such legal or contractual obligations. As a result, we could be subject to legal action or our customers could end their relationships with us. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages, and in some cases our customer agreements do not limit our remediation costs or liability with respect to data breaches.\nLitigation resulting from security breaches may adversely affect our business. Unauthorized access to our platform, systems, networks, or physical facilities, or those of our vendors, could result in litigation with our customers or other relevant stakeholders. These proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management\u2019s time and attention, increase our costs of doing business, or adversely affect our reputation. We could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products and/or platform capabilities in response to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business. If a security breach were to occur, and the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of personal information was disrupted, we could incur significant liability, or our platform, systems, or networks may be perceived as less desirable, which could negatively affect our business and damage our reputation.\nWe know that certain of our suppliers have been successfully attacked by certain malware aimed at extracting a ransom. Should such breaches occur in the future, production may be impacted, information infiltrated or other records and information compromised or lost. Breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect and any delay in identifying them could increase their harm. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a security breach of one of our suppliers could impact our reputation, cause us to incur significant costs, including legal expenses and remediation costs.\nAny such breaches of security and inappropriate access could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the costs to respond to a security breach and/or to mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, negative publicity, loss of customer trust, less use of our products and services as well as other harms to our business and our competitive position. Remediation of any potential security breach may involve significant time, resources, and expenses, which may result in potential regulatory inquiries, litigation or other investigations, and can affect our financial and operational condition.\nWe currently have a limited trading volume, which results in higher price volatility for, and reduced liquidity of, our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are currently quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cCERS.\u201d The market for our common stock has been limited due to low trading volume and the small number of brokerage firms acting as market makers. Active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. The absence of an active trading market increases price volatility and reduces the liquidity of our common stock. As long as this condition continues, the sale of a significant number of shares of common stock at any particular time could be difficult to achieve at the market prices prevailing immediately before such shares are offered, which may limit our ability to effectively raise money. In addition, due to the limitations\nof our market and the volatility in the market price of our stock, investors may face difficulties in selling shares at attractive prices when they want to sell. As a result of this lack of trading activity, the quoted price for our common stock is not necessarily a reliable indicator of its fair market value.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes is uncertain and may be limited.\nOur ability to use our federal and state net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the NOL carryforwards (if any), and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our NOL carryforwards. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act. In general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development credit carryforwards) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Our equity offerings and other changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, may have resulted or could in the future result in an ownership change. Although we have completed studies to provide reasonable assurance that an ownership change limitation would not apply, we cannot be certain that a taxing authority would reach the same conclusion. If, after a review or audit, an ownership change limitation were to apply, utilization of our domestic NOL and tax credit carryforwards could be limited in future periods and a portion of the carryforwards could expire before being utilized to reduce future income tax liabilities. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, California imposed limits on the usability of California state net operating losses to offset taxable income in tax years beginning after 2019 and before 2023. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, we may be unable to use all or a material portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us and adversely affect our future cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing intellectual property rights of others.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products and successfully defending our products against third-party challenges. Our technology will be protected from unauthorized use only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or effectively maintained as trade secrets. As a result, our success depends in part on our ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain patents;\n\u2022\nprotect trade secrets;\n\u2022\noperate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others; and\n\u2022\nprevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights.\nWe cannot be certain that our patents or patents that we license from others will be enforceable and afford protection against competitors. Our patents or patent applications, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies. Others may independently develop technologies similar to ours or independently duplicate our technologies. For example, we are aware of an expired U.S. patent issued to a third-party that covers methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products. We have reviewed the patent and believe there exist substantial questions concerning its validity. We cannot be certain, however, that a court would hold the patent to be invalid or not infringed by our platelet or plasma systems. In this regard, whether or not we have infringed this patent will not be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets the patent in the context of litigation. In the event that we are found to have infringed any valid claim of this patent, we may, among other things, be required to pay damages. Our patents expire at various dates between 2021 and 2037. Recent patent applications will, if granted, result in patents with later expiration dates. In addition, we have a license from Fresenius to U.S. and foreign patents relating to the INTERCEPT Blood System, which expire at various dates between 2021 and 2024. Due to the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of our potential products, our patents may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization. This would reduce or eliminate any advantage of the patents.\nWe cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. We may need to license the right to use third-party patents and intellectual property to continue development and commercialization of our products, including in connection with our\nplanned commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in the U.S. We may not be able to acquire such required licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may need to design around other parties\u2019 patents, or we may not be able to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of our products.\nOur patents do not cover all of the countries in which we are selling, and planning to sell, our products. We will not be able to prevent potential competitors from using our technology in countries where we do not have patent coverage. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., including the CIS countries, China and India, jurisdictions where we are currently expanding our commercialization efforts through distributors. In certain countries, compulsory licensing laws exist that may be used to compel a patent owner to grant licenses to third parties, for reasons such as non-use of the patented subject matter within a certain period of time after patent grant or commercializing in a manner that is cost-prohibitive in the country. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license for the INTERCEPT Blood System to a third-party, which could materially diminish the value of such patents. This could adversely impact our potential product revenue opportunities.\nWe may face litigation requiring us to defend against claims of infringement, assert claims of infringement, enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how or determine the scope and validity of others\u2019 proprietary rights. Patent litigation is costly. In addition, we may require interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of inventions relating to our patent applications. Litigation or interference proceedings could be expensive and time consuming, and we could be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights. We may rely, in certain circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and contractors. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others, disputes also may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. In the future, we may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weakness identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nComplying with Section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources. As a result of expanding our commercialization efforts, developing, improving and expanding our core information technology systems as well as implementing new systems to support our sales, supply chain activities and reporting capabilities, all of which require significant management time and support, we may not be able to complete our internal control evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. Should our internal controls be deemed ineffective, our ability to obtain additional financing, or obtain additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition and the value of our common stock. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the future, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion or expresses an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls in the future, investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports could be further eroded, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nAdverse market and economic conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business.\nSales of our products are dependent on purchasing decisions of and/or reimbursement from government health administration authorities, distribution partners and other organizations. As a result of adverse conditions affecting the global economy and credit and financial markets, including the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions due to political instability or terrorist attacks, economies and currencies largely affected by declining commodity prices or otherwise, these organizations may defer purchases, may be unable to satisfy their purchasing or reimbursement obligations, or may delay payment for the INTERCEPT Blood System. In addition, newly contracted or prospective customers may be unable to on-board, train staff and implement new technologies such as INTERCEPT due to the COVID-19 pandemic which would limit our ability to grow our business.\nThe sales of our products in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, countries are denominated in Euros and other non-U.S. currencies. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk, and our results of operations have been and will continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, in particular the Euro. In addition, there have been concerns for the overall stability and suitability of the Euro as a single currency given the economic and political challenges facing individual Eurozone countries. Continuing deterioration in the creditworthiness of Eurozone countries, the withdrawal of, or the announcement of the withdrawal of, one or more member countries from the European Union, or E.U., following the United Kingdom\u2019s, or U.K.\u2019s, withdrawal from the E.U., or the failure of the Euro as a common European currency or an otherwise diminished value of the Euro could materially and adversely affect our product revenue. In certain territories that we currently sell into, a devaluation of local currency against the U.S. Dollar is occurring and is making purchase of our products more expensive for customers. Should this persist or worsen, customers may not be able to afford purchasing our Euro or U.S. Dollar priced products, or we may choose to lower prices to those customers which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn the past, a meaningful amount of our product revenue has come from sales to distributors for the Russian, other CIS countries, as well as Middle Eastern markets. Weakness and/or instability in worldwide oil prices and the ongoing civil, political and economic disturbances in Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and their spillover effect on surrounding areas, along with the impact of sanctions imposed against Russia by certain European nations and the U.S., may significantly devalue the Russian Ruble and other CIS currencies and have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the Russian and other CIS countries\u2019 economies, particularly if sanctions continue to be levied against Russia or are strengthened from those currently in place from either the E.U., U.S. or both. In particular, the unprecedented weakness in oil demand and prices resulting from, among other things, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively affect our existing and future business opportunities in oil dependent countries and may cause collection difficulties, declining prices or all of the above. While our agreement with our Russian and other CIS distributors calls for sales, invoicing and collections to be denominated in Euros, if significant sanctions continue or are strengthened, if new sanctions are imposed, the Russian economy and value of the Ruble or other CIS currencies may weaken, and our business in Russia and other CIS countries may be negatively impacted further or never recover to historical levels.\nMoreover, the U.S. administration has imposed tariffs on certain imports into the U.S., and the E.U., China and other countries have responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. exports. We cannot predict what effects these and potential additional tariffs will have on our business, including in the context of escalating trade tensions. However, these tariffs and other trade restrictions could increase our operating costs, reduce our gross margins or otherwise negatively impact our financial results.\nIn addition, terrorist attacks and civil unrests in some of the countries where we do business, and the resulting need for enhanced security measures may impact our ability to deliver services, threaten the safety of our employees, and increase our costs of operations.\nProvisions of our charter documents, our compensatory arrangements and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if the offer may be considered beneficial by our stockholders.\nProvisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay, deter or prevent a change in control. The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law impose various impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless its application has been waived, provides certain default anti-takeover protections in connection with transactions between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d. Generally, Section 203 prohibits stockholders who, alone or together with their affiliates and associates, own more than 15% of the subject company from engaging in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder of such subject company without approval of the board or the vote of two-thirds of the shares held by the independent stockholders. Additionally, provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could deter, delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including without limitation, the authority of the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. In addition, our executive employment agreements, change of control severance benefit plan and equity incentive plans and agreements thereunder provide for certain severance benefits in connection with a change of control of us, including single-trigger equity vesting acceleration benefits with respect to outstanding stock options, which could increase the costs to a third-party acquirer and/or deter such third-party from acquiring us.", "PERMNO": 84413, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CERS"}
