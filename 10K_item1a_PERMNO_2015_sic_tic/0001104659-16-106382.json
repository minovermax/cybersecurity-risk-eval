Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the Company\u2019s other SEC filings, in press releases and in oral statements to shareholders and securities analysts that are not statements of historical or current facts are \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results or performance of the Company to be materially different from the results or performance expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The words \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cseeks\u201d and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.\nOur business faces significant risks, including the risks described below. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nOur Results Are Dependent on Our Manufacturing Partners\u2019 Continued Use of Our POPS Program\nWe are largely dependent on our POPS program, which represented approximately 93% of the total net sales in both 2015 and 2014. The POPS program is sold primarily to CPG manufacturers. During 2015, one customer accounted for approximately 37% of our total net sales and during 2014, two customers accounted for approximately 33% and 10% of our total net sales. Additionally, changes in economic conditions could result in reductions in advertising and promotional expenditures by branded product manufacturers, which may result in decreased spending for the in-store advertising services we offer. Should these manufacturers no longer perceive sufficient value in the POPS program, or if our POPS program does not continue to result in product sales increases, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected due to our heavy dependence on this program.\nWe Are Dependent on Our Contracts with Retailers and Our Ability to Renew Those Contracts When They Expire\nOn an ongoing basis, we negotiate renewals of various retailer contracts that allow us access to place signs at shelf in their stores. Some of our retailer contracts require us to guarantee minimum payments. If we are unable to offer guarantees at the required levels in the new contracts, and the contracts are not renewed because of that reason or because of other reasons, it will have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur POPS business and results of operations could be adversely affected if the number of retailer partners decreases significantly, the quality of our retail distribution network decreases, or if the retailer partners fail to continue to maintain POPSigns at the shelf in their stores.\nOur Results Are Dependent on the Success of Our Business Relationship with News America\nOur results depend, in part, on the success of our sales and marketing efforts as News America\u2019s exclusive agent for signs with price into the News America network of retailers and upon our ability to successfully sell programs into this network. Additionally, if disputes with News America arise in the future regarding the operational aspects of our agreement, it could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nWe Face Significant Competition\nWe face significant competition from News America, who also provides at-shelf advertising and promotional signage. Although the settlement with News America resulted in a 10-year agreement through 2021 that provides us additional opportunities to compete by offering signs with price in News America\u2019s network, as News America\u2019s exclusive agent, we will continue to compete for advertising dollars with News America\u2019s other at-shelf advertising and promotional signage offerings. News America has significantly greater financial resources that can be used to develop and market their products. Should our competition succeed in obtaining more of the at-shelf advertising business from our current customers, our revenues and related operations would be adversely affected.\nOur Results Are Dependent on Our Ability to Successfully Introduce New Product Offerings that Meet Customer Demands\nOur ability to retain, increase and engage our customers and to increase our revenues will depend partially on our ability to create successful new products. We may modify our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products, including acquired products. If new or enhanced products fail to engage consumers, we may fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenues, margins, or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected. In the future, we may invest in new products and initiatives to generate revenue, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful. If we are not successful with these new approaches, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenues or recover any associated product development costs, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe May be Subject to Major Litigation\nWe were involved in major litigation with News America between 2003 and 2011. During 2011, the Company and News America entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the antitrust and false advertising lawsuit that had been outstanding for several years. Although the Company obtained a significant settlement in 2011, if future disputes with News America, or other companies arise, it could have an adverse effect on our Company.\nOur Customers and Retailers May Be Susceptible To Changes in Economic Conditions\nOur revenues are affected by our customers\u2019 marketing and advertising spending and our revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions. Another economic downturn may reduce demand for our products and services or depress pricing of those products and services and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Retailers may be impacted by changes in consumer spending as well, which may adversely impact our ability to renew contracts with our existing retailers as well as contract with new retailers on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nWe Have a Limited Number of Key Personnel\nGiven the unique business we operate and the importance of customer relationships to our business, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, operational and sales personnel. Competition for talented personnel is intense, and we cannot be certain that we can retain our managerial, operational and sales personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. Our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, the Company has one individual currently serving as both principal executive and principal financial officer.\nOur Results of Operations May Be Subject To Significant Fluctuations\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to a wide variety of factors including:\n\u00b7 the addition or loss of contracts with retailers;\n\u00b7 the loss of customers or changes in timing and amount of our customers\u2019 spending with us;\n\u00b7 the timing of seasonal events for customers;\n\u00b7 the timing of new retail stores being added or removed;\n\u00b7 costs of evaluating and developing new products;\n\u00b7 the timing of additional selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses; and\n\u00b7 competitive conditions in our industry.\nDue to these factors, our quarterly and annual net sales, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future and this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nInvestment in Our Stock Could Result in Fluctuating Returns\nDuring 2015, the sale prices of our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Stock Market ranged from a low of $2.04 to a high of $3.68. We believe factors such as the fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results described above, the market\u2019s acceptance of our services and products, the performance of our business relative to market expectations, as well as limited daily trading volume of our stock, and general volatility in the securities markets, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations, resulting in changes in the market prices of the stock of many companies, which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies.", "PERMNO": 76934, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "ISIG"}
