{"cik": "68709", "company": "MTS SYSTEMS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-11-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves risks. The following summarizes what we believe to be the most important risks facing us that could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. The information about these risks should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nMarket Risks\nOur business is significantly international in scope.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia. Approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a large portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in Euros, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen and other foreign currencies.\nAccordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nexposure to the risk of currency value fluctuations, where payment for products is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars;\n\u2022\nvariability in the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated assets, earnings and cash flows;\n\u2022\ndifficulty enforcing agreements, including patent and trademarks, and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ntax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S., the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings and restrictions on repatriation of foreign earnings;\n\u2022\nhigher danger of terrorist activity, war or civil unrest compared to domestic operations;\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions, including tariffs recently imposed by the U. S. and responsive tariffs imposed by China and the European Union;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing global operations;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applicable to our international operations, and significant compliance costs and penalties for failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets, and including the continued volatility in currency exchange rates and uncertainties caused by the United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union.\nThese risks could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations could also make our products more expensive than competitors' products not subject to these fluctuations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in international markets. As further described in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, revenue for fiscal year 2018 was favorably impacted by currency translation.\nOur business is subject to strong competition.\nOur products are sold in competitive markets throughout the world. Competition is based on application knowledge, product features and design, brand recognition, reliability, technology, breadth of product offerings, price, delivery, customer relationships and after-market support. If we are not perceived as competitive in overall value as measured by these criteria, our customers would likely choose solutions offered by our competitors or developed internally.\nOur business is subject to customer demand cycles.\nFor many of our products, orders are subject to customers' procurement cycles and their willingness and ability to invest in capital, especially in the cyclical automotive, aircraft and machine tool industries. Any event that adversely impacts those customers' new product development activities may reduce their demand for our products.\nWe may experience difficulty obtaining materials or components for our products, or the cost of materials or components may increase.\nWe purchase materials and components from third-party suppliers, some of whom may be competitors. Other materials and components may be provided by a limited number of suppliers or by sole sources and could only be replaced with difficulty or at significant added cost. Additionally, some materials or components may become scarce or difficult to obtain in the market or they may increase in price. This could adversely affect the lead time within which we receive the materials or components, and in turn affect our commitments to our customers, or could adversely affect the cost or quality of materials.\nOur level of indebtedness and interest rate fluctuations on that indebtedness could adversely affect our business and results of operations and may require the use of our available cash resources to meet repayment obligations, which could reduce the cash available for other purposes.\nWe have a senior secured credit facility that provides for a revolving credit facility and a tranche B term loan facility, both of which require that we pay a variable interest rate on outstanding borrowings. The debt under the tranche B term loan facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount and matures on July 5, 2023. As of September 29, 2018, we did not have any borrowings under the revolving credit facility; however, we may, at times, use debt under the revolving credit facility to purchase shares of our common stock, finance working capital needs or continue to finance the growth of the business through acquisitions.\nOur level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs. We hedge against a portion of the risk on the tranche B term loan facility by swapping the variable rate for a fixed rate. Increases in interest rates may directly impact the amount of interest we are required to pay and reduce earnings accordingly. In addition, developments in tax policy, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for interest paid on outstanding indebtedness, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Further, our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our tangible equity units contain customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain restrictions on operations that could impose operating and financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to enter into particular transactions and to engage in other actions that we may believe are advisable or necessary for our business. The tranche B term loan facility is also subject to mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances and requires a prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow. Any future mandatory prepayments will reduce our cash available for other purposes and could impact our ability to reinvest in other areas of our business. Due to planned prepayments made during fiscal year 2018, we do not anticipate an excess cash flow payment will be required in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 based on fiscal year 2018 results. For further information on our financing arrangements, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur outstanding 8.75% tangible equity units (TEUs) may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by the outstanding TEUs sold in our June 2016 public offering. For example, additional shares of our common stock are currently and will continue to be issuable upon settlement of the purchase contract component of the TEUs through expiration on July 1, 2019. The settlement rates for such purchase contracts are subject to certain anti-dilution and make-whole adjustments that could increase, potentially significantly, the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon such settlement. As a result, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by the following factors:\n\u2022\ninvestors' anticipation of the sale into the market of a substantial number of additional shares of common stock received upon settlement of the purchase contract component of the TEUs;\n\u2022\npossible sales of our common stock by investors who view the TEUs as a more attractive means of equity participation in the Company than owning shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activities that may develop involving the TEUs, the purchase contracts and our common stock.\nIn addition, our debt obligations under the senior amortizing note component of the TEUs may further influence the market price of our common stock, including but not limited to our ability to make timely payments to holders of the notes. For further information on our TEUs, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperational Risks\nTransfer of certain Test production operations in China to our new contract manufacturing partner may be subject to delays, increased costs or other unanticipated consequences.\nOn March 13, 2018, we announced workforce reductions and manufacturing facility closures in our Test segment corresponding to the transfer of certain production operations in China to a contract manufacturing partner. These changes are designed to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in growth initiatives. We can make no assurances that our current estimates of costs and timing of this restructuring action will be accurate or that additional costs will not be incurred as we continue the restructuring action. Any differences from our current estimates could be material and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations through delays in our timeline or increased costs. For further information on restructuring initiatives, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWhile we believe our China contract manufacturing partner to be qualified to manufacture our Test segment products, we may need to address short-term quality and delivery issues. We have not previously used contract manufacturing partners on a large scale. Significant quality or delivery schedule concerns and unforeseen costs may adversely affect our relationships with customers and our overall business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFinal impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be materially different from our current estimates.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The new law made numerous changes to U.S. federal corporate tax law and reduced our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 and future periods. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and prompts various other changes to U.S. federal corporate tax law, including the establishment of a territorial-style system for taxing foreign-source income of domestic multinational corporations. The tax benefit recorded in fiscal year 2018 involved significant judgment and assumptions as to the impact of the Tax Act. Our estimated impact of the new law is based on management's current knowledge and assumptions. The provisional amounts are based on information available at this time and may change due to a variety of factors, including, among others, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury about implementing the Tax Act and management's further assessment of the Tax Act and related regulatory guidance. Recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on anticipated guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service and other standard setting and regulatory bodies about implementing the Tax Act. We expect to record any adjustments within one year of the enactment of the Tax Act, or during our first quarter of fiscal year 2019, in accordance with the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), and these adjustments could be material. The full impact of the Tax Act on our business, operations and financial statements cannot be predicted at this time, and we make no assurances in this regard.\nOur business operations may be affected by government contracting risks.\nGovernment business is important to us and is expected to increase in the future. Revenue from U.S. government contracts varies by year. Such revenue as a percent of our total revenue was 4%, 4% and 3% for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting and result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Failure to comply could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to secure future U.S. government contracts and export control licenses, and our results of operations or financial condition. These laws and regulations also create compliance risks and affect how we do business with federal agency clients. U.S. government contracts, as well as contracts with certain foreign governments with which we do business, are also subject to modification or termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. Further, any investigation relating to, or suspension or debarment from, U.S. government contracting could have a material impact on our results of operations as, during the duration of any suspension or debarment, we would be prohibited or otherwise limited in our ability to enter into prime contracts or subcontracts with U.S. government agencies, certain entities that receive U.S. government funds or that are otherwise subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and certain state government or commercial customers who decline to contract with suspended or debarred entities. A federal suspension could also impact our ability to obtain export control licenses which are materially important to our business.\nWe are subject to risks because we design and manufacture first-of-a-kind products.\nWe design and build systems that are unique and innovative and, in some cases, the first created to address complex and unresolved issues. The design, manufacture and support of these systems may involve higher than planned costs. If we are unable to meet our customers' expectations, our reputation and ability to further utilize our expertise will likely be damaged.\nBacklog, sales, delivery and acceptance cycle for many of our products is irregular and may not develop as anticipated.\nMany of our products have long sales, delivery and acceptance cycles. In addition, certain contracts within our backlog are subject to order cancellations. If an order is canceled, we typically would only be entitled to receive reimbursement from the customer for actual costs incurred under the arrangement plus a reasonable margin. Events may cause recognition of orders, backlog and results of operations to be irregular over shorter periods of time. These factors include the timing of individual large orders which may be impacted by interest rates, customer capital spending and product development cycles, design and manufacturing problems, capacity constraints, delays in product readiness, damage or delays in transit, problems in achieving technical performance requirements, and various customer-initiated delays. Any such delay or any cancellations may cause fluctuations in our reported periodic financial results and may cause our stated backlog conversion to revenue to be inaccurate.\nThe business could be adversely affected by product liability and commercial litigation.\nOur products or services may be claimed to cause or contribute to personal injury or property damage to our customers' facilities. Additionally, we are, at times, involved in commercial disputes with third parties, such as customers, vendors and others. The ensuing claims may arise singularly, in groups of related claims or in class actions involving multiple claimants. Such claims and litigation are frequently expensive and time consuming to resolve and may result in substantial liability to us, and any liability and related costs and expenses may not be recoverable through insurance or other forms of reimbursement.\nWe may experience difficulties obtaining and retaining the services of skilled employees.\nWe rely on knowledgeable, experienced and skilled technical personnel, particularly engineers, sales management and service personnel, to design, assemble, sell and service our products. We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of such people which could adversely affect our business. The inability to transfer knowledge and transition between roles within these teams could also adversely affect our business.\nWe may fail to protect our intellectual property effectively or may infringe upon the intellectual property of others.\nWe have developed significant proprietary technology and other rights that are used in our businesses. We rely on trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. While we take enforcement of these rights seriously, other companies such as competitors or others in markets in which we do not participate may attempt to copy or use our intellectual property for their own benefit.\nIn addition, the intellectual property of others also has an impact on our ability to offer some of our products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors' patents or other intellectual property may limit our ability to offer products and services to our customers. Any infringement on the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, our products and services.\nIntellectual property litigation can be very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversion of our resources, both of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of our intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our business operations and financial results could be adversely impacted. Evolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of cyber-attacks. Although we strive to have appropriate security controls in place, prevention of security breaches cannot be assured, particularly as cyber threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our security measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. The consequences of these risks could adversely impact our business operations and financial results.\nIn addition, our handling of certain data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, which have been adopted by various federal, state and foreign governments to regulate the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals. Several foreign countries in which we conduct business, including the European Economic Area (EEA), currently have in place, or have recently proposed, laws or regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security, which are more restrictive than those imposed in the U.S. Some of these laws are in their early stages and we cannot yet determine the impact these revised laws and regulations, if implemented, may have on our business. However, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these privacy laws, regulations, policies or obligations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data in our possession, could result in government enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. For example, the EEA-wide General Data Protection Regulation became effective on May 25, 2018 and replaced the data protection laws of each EEA member state. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations and enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data.\nGovernment regulation and policy imposes costs and other constraints.\nOur manufacturing operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations pertaining to health and safety matters, as well as the handling or discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. We expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these laws and may incur penalties for any failure to do so. We may also be identified as a responsible party and be subject to liability relating to any investigation and cleanup of properties used for industrial purposes or the generation or disposal of hazardous substances. In addition, some of our products contain hazardous substances and are subject to requirements that regulate their content, such as the European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive and analogous regulations elsewhere. Capital expenditures for environmental compliance were immaterial in fiscal year 2018, and we do not expect such expenditures will be material in fiscal year 2019; however, the factors described above may cause our estimates to differ from our expectations.\nSome of our export sales require approval from the U.S. government. Changes in political relations between the U.S. and foreign countries and/or specific potential customers for which export licenses may be required, may cause a license application to be delayed or denied, or a previously issued license withdrawn, rendering us unable to complete a sale or vulnerable to competitors who do not operate under such restrictions. In addition, the U.S. government has recently imposed tariffs on certain products imported from China as well as steel and aluminum imported from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. China and the European Union have imposed tariffs on U.S. products in retaliation. These tariffs could force our customers or us to consider various strategic options including, but not limited to, looking for different suppliers, shifting production to facilities in different geographic regions, absorbing the additional costs or passing the cost on to customers. Moreover, any retaliatory actions by other countries where we operate could also negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe are required to conduct a good faith reasonable country of origin analysis on our use of conflict minerals, which has imposed and may impose additional costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. While there is pending litigation challenging these rules, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We have adopted a policy relating to conflict minerals, incorporating the standards set forth in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance, which affects the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As we continue our due diligence, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we have and may continue to implement. We may also encounter challenges in our efforts to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict-free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.\nWe may not achieve our growth plans for the expansion of the business.\nIn addition to market penetration, our long-term success depends on our ability to expand our business through (a) new product development and service offerings; (b) mergers and acquisitions; and/or (c) geographic expansion.\nNew product development and service offerings require that we maintain our ability to improve existing products, continue to bring innovative products and services to market in a timely fashion and adapt products and services to the needs and standards of current and potential customers. Our products and services may become less competitive or eclipsed by technologies to which we do not have access or which render our solutions obsolete.\nMergers and acquisitions will be accompanied by risks that may include:\n\u2022\nsuitable candidates may not exist or may not be available at acceptable costs;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve, or delays in achieving, the financial and strategic goals, including growth opportunities and cost synergies, for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, including the inability to eliminate duplicative costs or the substantial expenses that may be incurred in connection with integration;\n\u2022\ndisruption of ongoing business and acquired business and distraction of management from the operation of both businesses;\n\u2022\ndilution of existing shareholders and earnings per share;\n\u2022\nunanticipated, undisclosed or inaccurately assessed liabilities, legal risks and costs;\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory requirements of the acquired business was not formerly a public company; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties retaining the key vendors, customers or employees of the acquired business.\nAcquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside the U.S. will increase our exposure to the risks of international operations discussed in the operational risk factors.\nGeographic expansion may be outside of the U.S., and hence will be disproportionately subject to the risks of international operations discussed in the operational risk factors.\nFor further information on our business acquisitions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for goodwill and long-lived assets.\nAs of September 29, 2018, the net carrying value of goodwill and long-lived assets (property and equipment, net and intangible assets, net) totaled $705,682. We periodically assess the value of these assets for impairment in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our businesses, significant unexpected or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future impairment charges could significantly affect reported financial results.\nIf we fail to maintain effective processes and controls relative to adherence to our Code of Conduct, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur Code of Conduct and other internal policies prohibit us and our employees from engaging in unethical business practices. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of such policies and procedures or that our processes and controls will be sufficient to detect any such violations. The investigation into potential violations of these policies, or even allegations of such violations, and evaluation of our internal controls, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, and lead to significant costs and expenses, including legal and accounting fees, and such expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Further, if our employees or agents violate such policies and procedures, such actions could result in management override of internal controls over financial reporting. If we, or our employees or agents acting on our behalf, are found to have engaged in practices that violate these policies and/or applicable law, we could suffer severe fines and penalties, repayment of ill-gotten gains, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation, material weaknesses in our financial reporting and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our reputation, sales activities or stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of applicable laws and regulations.", "PERMNO": 50623, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MTSC"}
