If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe Corporate Integrity Agreement that we entered into in December 2010 expired in December 2015; however we have yet to receive final approval from the OIG with respect to our compliance with its terms.\nIn December 2010, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement, referred to as the CIA, with the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (OIG-HHS). The foregoing agreement resolved the investigation commenced by the Department of Justice in December 2007 into the Company's consulting arrangements with orthopaedic surgeons relating to our hip and knee products in the United States. The CIA imposed on us certain obligations to maintain compliance with U.S. healthcare regulatory laws. Our failure to have demonstrated compliance with its terms could expose us to significant liability including, but not limited to, exclusion from federal healthcare program participation, including Medicaid and Medicare, civil and criminal fines or penalties, and additional litigation cost and expense. Any of these consequences would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The CIA acknowledges the existence of our Corporate Compliance Program and provides for certain other compliance-related activities during the five-year term of the agreement. If we are found to have breached the CIA, the OIG-HHS could take further action against us, up to and including excluding us from participation in federal healthcare programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The five-year term of the CIA expired in December 2015, and we are awaiting the OIG\u2019s approval of our compliance with its terms.\nOur settlement with the United States Department of Justice and OIG-HHS could lead to further governmental investigations or actions by other third parties.\nAs a result of the allegations of wrongdoing and the public disclosure of our settlement with the OIG-HHS, other governmental agencies, including state authorities, could conduct their own investigations or institute proceedings, none of which is precluded by terms of our existing settlement. The costs of defending or resolving any such investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEfforts to enhance our corporate compliance program require the cooperation of many individuals, may divert resources from our other business activities and may require substantial investment.\nWe are committed to the continued enhancement of our corporate compliance program, which requires substantial financial and human resources. The continued successful implementation of our enhanced corporate compliance program requires significant cooperation from our employees, distributors and sales agents as well as the healthcare professionals with whom our agents interact. The increased expenses related to these efforts may negatively impact our results of operations.\nEconomic downturns, both domestically and internationally, and disruptions in capital and credit markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of funds necessary for us to meet both our short term and long-term funding needs and may otherwise impair our ability to grow our business, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business may be negatively affected by economic downturns, which could negatively affect the availability of credit. We rely predominantly on the credit markets and borrowing under our existing credit facility to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs to the extent that funds are not available from our operations. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facility and could make alternative funding, such as our raising of capital through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities, unavailable on reasonable terms or at all. Our access to funds under our current credit facility is dependent on the ability of the lending banks thereunder to meet their respective funding commitments.\nIf our lenders are unable to obtain funds, whether due to a shortage of liquidity in the banking system or otherwise, then they may not be able to meet their respective funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows.\nLong-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our liquidity and require that we conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit or funding arrangements can be obtained. Our conservation of cash in such instances could require that we defer capital expenditures and reduce or eliminate discretionary uses of cash, which could harm our competitive position and results of operation.\nOur industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater regulation in the future.\nThe premarket review, manufacture, marketing, sale and third-party coverage of and payment for our medical devices are subject to significant regulation by various federal agencies and departments, including the United States Department of Justice, the United States Department of Defense, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and various agencies within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, including FDA, OIG-HHS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of Civil Rights, and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. In addition, certain state governments and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with health care providers. The Affordable Care Act included a provision titled the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. CMS has been charged with implementing the Sunshine Act and has called it the Open Payment Program. As a result, we are required by law to annually disclose payments and other transfers of value to health care providers licensed by certain states and, starting with payments or other transfers of value made on or after August 1, 2013, to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could have adverse legal consequences. In addition, we may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement policies, systems, and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also affect our business. We anticipate that government and congressional scrutiny of our sector will continue and potentially increase and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.\nOur products are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our medical devices. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain marketing clearance or approval for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products. If such clearance or approval is obtained, as the case may be, it may: (1) take significant time; (2) require the expenditure of significant resources; (3) involve costly and extensive clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance; (4) involve modifications, repairs, or replacements of our products, and (5) result in limitations on the proposed uses of our products. The approved or cleared uses of our products limits how are products can be marketed and may limit third-party coverage of procedures involving our products depending on whether the approved or cleared uses of our products are consistent with the coverage criteria of the third-party payor.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. We are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements, including, among other things, the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on Form FDA-483, untitled letters, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. Since 2009, the FDA has significantly increased its oversight by hiring new investigators and increasing inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin or restrain certain conduct that gave rise to regulatory violations pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend criminal\nprosecution to the DOJ. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nIn addition, device manufacturers are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for \u201coff-label\u201d uses, including actions alleging that federal health care program claims for reimbursement of products promoted for \u201coff-label\u201d uses are false and fraudulent claims to the government. The failure to comply with \u201coff-label\u201d promotion restrictions can result in significant administrative obligations and costs, and potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\nOur failure to comply with rules relating to reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business operations.\nOur devices are subject to regulation regarding coverage and cost by non-FDA agencies within HHS, including the CMS as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services, as well as by private insurers and other third-party payors. Federal government health care laws apply when we submit a claim on behalf of a federal health care program beneficiary, or when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed, in whole or in part, under a federal government-funded health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The principal federal laws implicated include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment, the primary one of which is the False Claims Act; those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded health care programs, known as the Anti-Kickback Statute and Anti-Inducement Act; and that which prohibits health care service providers seeking reimbursement for providing certain services to a patient who was referred by a physician who has certain types of direct or indirect financial relationships with the service provider, known as the Stark law.\nIf a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by CMS. If we are excluded from participation based on such an interpretation it could adversely affect our reputation and business operations.\nFailure to comply with certain federal laws is particularly acute for us given the CIA under which we agree to independent monitoring of our activities and reporting of those activities that fail to comply with federal law or the CIA.\nWe may be subject to suit under a federal whistleblower statute.\nThose who engage in business with the federal government, directly or indirectly, may be sued under a federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These lawsuits, known as qui tam suits, are authorized under certain circumstances by the False Claims Act and can involve significant monetary damages and award bounties to private plaintiffs who successfully bring these suits. If any of these lawsuits were to be brought against us, such suits combined with increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nThe Affordable Care Act has sought to link violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute with violations of the False Claims Act, making it arguably easier for the government or for whistleblowers, acting in the name of the government, to sue device manufacturers under the False Claims Act. Another law, enacted in 2009, attempts to ease some of the other requirements that restricted whistleblower and other False Claims Act suits. Some of these requirements may be retroactive to 2008, but the constitutionality of that provision has yet to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nQuality problems with our processes, goods, and services could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and erode our competitive advantage, sales, and market share.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our goods and services. If we fail to meet these standards, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Aside from specific customer standards, our success depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precision-engineered components, subassemblies, and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality components will be harmed, our competitive advantage could be\ndamaged, and we could lose customers and market share. Moreover, failure to comply with our internal standards may result in the FDA viewing our products as misbranded or adulterated and subject to voluntary or involuntary recall or seizure or other sanctions including criminal and civil penalties.\nHealthcare policy changes, including U.S. healthcare reform legislation signed in 2010, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. health care system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. Certain provisions of these acts were implemented in 2014 and other provisions will be implemented later, therefore, it is difficult to assess the full long-term impact of these laws on our business. Certain adverse effects though are apparent. The legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales that commenced in January 2013. Under the legislation, the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately $20 billion over 10 years. We currently estimate that our annual excise tax fee will be within the range of $1.9 to $2.2 million pre-tax. On December 18, 2015, the President signed into law the \"Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015,\" which imposes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax effective for sales made after December 31, 2015; however, the 2.3% excise tax on certain medical devices is scheduled to be reinstated for sales transacted after December 31, 2017. The Affordable Care Act also focuses on a number of Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs. It is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequences these provisions will have on patient access to new technologies. The Medicare provisions include value-based payment programs, increased funding of comparative effectiveness research, reduced hospital payments for avoidable readmissions and hospital acquired conditions, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies that promote care coordination (such as bundled physician and hospital payments). Additionally, the law includes a reduction in the annual rate of inflation for Medicare payments to hospitals that began in 2011 and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend ways of reducing the rate of growth in Medicare spending beginning in 2014. We cannot predict what health care programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation. However, any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nSince the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the President has signed into law various bills affecting or potentially affecting reimbursement for health care including by way of example, the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010, Budget Control Act of 2011, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, and Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. The Budget Control Act imposed a 2% reduction on payments to hospitals under Part A, which has a negative effect on those selling products to hospitals, including device manufacturers. We have not yet fully assessed the long-term effects of the various post-Affordable Care Act laws.\nWe expect the healthcare industry to face increased scrutiny over reimbursement and healthcare reform, which could adversely impact how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products.\nIn the United States and other countries, sales of our products depend, in part, upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers, which include government health administration authorities, managed care providers and private health insurers. Third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services. Increasing expenditures for healthcare have been the subject of considerable public attention in the United States and abroad. Both private and government entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs. Numerous proposals that would effect changes in the U.S. healthcare system have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures. Although we cannot predict the full effect on our business of the implementation of this legislation, we believe that legislation that reduces reimbursement for our products or for procedures that use our products would adversely affect sales. This could materially and adversely affect our business by reducing our ability to generate revenue, raise capital, obtain additional collaborators and market our products.\nWe must incur significant expenditures in order to maintain relatively high levels of inventory, which can reduce our cash flows.\nBecause we must maintain substantial levels of inventory, we are subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence. If a substantial portion of our inventory became obsolete, then we would experience a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting inventory impairment charges and out-of-pocket costs required to replace such inventory.\nWe rely upon third party suppliers for raw materials and supplies, and such parties' failure to perform would result in increased production costs.\nSome of our suppliers rely on a single source of supply for raw materials and/or other inputs of production. Should the availability and on-time delivery of raw materials and supplies needed in the production of our products and services become unreliable or significantly more costly, then our earnings may be materially and adversely impacted due to the resulting increased costs of production.\nWe conduct business in a highly competitive industry.\nThe orthopaedic implant industry is subject to competition in the following key areas: product features and design, innovation, service, the ability to maintain new product flow, clinical acceptance of our products by key orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals, strength of distribution network and price. In addition, we compete to obtain and retain regional sales representatives within the medical community. Our largest competitors in the orthopaedic device market are DePuy Synthes, Inc., a division of Johnson and Johnson, ZimmerBiomet, Inc., a subsidiary of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Stryker Corporation, and Smith and Nephew plc. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than us, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur success is partially dependent upon our ability to successfully market new and improved products and the failure of the market to accept our new or improved products, or our failure to successfully market these products would adversely impact our revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe failure of our products to gain market acceptance would likely have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that our products will gain market acceptance. Future acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including, among others:\n\u00b7\nperceptions by surgeons, patients, third party payers and others in the medical community, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u00b7\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new products and of surgeons to decide to use these products;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in our product's approved labeling;\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy and potential advantages relative to competing products and products under development;\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of education, marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any;\n\u00b7\npublicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments;\n\u00b7\nreimbursement of our products by third party payers; and\n\u00b7\nthe price for our products and competing products.\nWe distribute and sell certain third party manufacturers' products, and these third parties could discontinue their relationships with us.\nShould we fail to meet the minimum sales performance or purchase commitments contained in our distribution agreements with third party manufacturers, those third parties may elect to discontinue our distribution of their\nrespective products and services. Should we lose the rights to one or more of our distribution agreements, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, and results of operations.\nWe cannot provide assurance as to the level of protection that patents on specific designs and processes will afford us, and, with respect to some products, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how which provide less protection.\nWe cannot provide assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection that existing or future patents, if any, may afford us, that confidential or proprietary information agreements will not be breached, that the parties from whom we have licensed or otherwise acquired patent rights, proprietary rights and technology have full rights to those patent rights and technology, or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. Our Optetrak knee system and Equinoxe shoulder system are subject to patents that we license or hold. Due to the relatively large percentage of our revenues attributable to the Optetrak knee and Equinoxe shoulder systems, if it were determined that the holders of these patents do not have sufficient legal rights to the patents, our use of the patents could be compromised, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on proprietary technology that we may not be able to protect and which may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur success depends, in part, on the strength of the intellectual property rights relating to our products and proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we can obtain patent protection for all of our products, whether in the United States or abroad, or that any protection that is obtained would be effective or would withstand challenges as to validity and enforceability.\nWe do not currently have patent protection for all of our products. For our unpatented products, the only intellectual property rights that exist at present, if any, are trade secret rights. We cannot assure you that others will not readily ascertain by proper means the unpatented technology used in or embodied by our products, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent products or that we can meaningfully protect the rights to unpatented products. We cannot guarantee that our agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, sub-licensees and strategic partners restricting the disclosure and use of trade secrets, inventions and confidential information relating to our products will provide meaningful protection.\nIt is possible that third parties may assert that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights, and it is virtually impossible for us to be certain that no infringement exists. Furthermore, because we have acquired some of the intellectual property used in our business from third parties, there are inherent uncertainties about the origin and ownership of this intellectual property that could contribute to our infringement exposure.\nIt is also possible that we may need to acquire additional licenses from third parties in order to avoid infringement. We cannot assure you that any required license would be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another party's intellectual property rights as well as in enforcing our rights against others; and if we were found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, the manufacture, sale and use of our products could be enjoined. Any claims against us, whether such claims were with or without merit, would likely consume a significant amount of management's time and resources. Furthermore, parties who may bring claims against us could have greater resources than we have.\nAny of these events could materially harm our cash flow, liquidity, and results of operations.\nInternational patent protection is particularly uncertain, and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries, we may have to expend substantial sums and management resources.\nPatent law outside the United States is in some cases different than in the United States and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to the treatment of humans. We may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our foreign patents or our competitors\u2019 foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts.\nWe must devote substantial resources to research and development, which adversely impacts our cash flows and provides no guarantee of success.\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development, but cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in developing successful new products or improving existing products so that our products remain competitive and avoid obsolescence. In addition, whether or not successful, research and development costs are significant, and our research and development efforts place stress on our cash flows, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if we are unsuccessful in developing and producing competitive products that achieve market acceptance.\nWe are subject to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the design, marketing and sale of orthopaedic implants and surgical instrumentation.\nWe cannot provide assurance we will not face product liability claims that result in substantial liability for which we are not fully insured. A large, successful claim against us, for which we are partially or completely uninsured, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due the cost of defending against such a claim, together with the cost associated with any payment of damages. Even if a product liability claim is meritless, otherwise unsuccessful or not in excess of our insurance coverage limits, our cash available for other purposes, such as research and development, could be adversely affected, causing a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, product liability claims may result in reduced demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and could also result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to secure and maintain adequate levels of product liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms, or at all.\nProduct liability insurance premiums are volatile. If premiums increase significantly, then our operating costs would increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. We presently carry product liability insurance with coverage in an amount we consider reasonable and customary. However, this insurance coverage includes various deductibles, limitations and exclusions from coverage and may not fully cover all potential claims. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance in the future at an acceptable cost, or at all, which could result in our need to self-insure and otherwise have an adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nBoth our products and third party products that we distribute may be subject to recalls or product liability claims.\nBoth our products and third-party products that we distribute are used in medical procedures; therefore all products sold by us must function with precision and accuracy. If any of these products do not function as designed, or are designed improperly, we or the third party manufacturer of these products may have to withdraw such products from the market whether by choice or due to a regulatory order. In addition, if patients suffer injury as a result of any failure of these products to function as designed, or as a result of a defective design, we could be subject to lawsuits seeking significant compensatory and punitive damages. Any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe partially depend on third parties for sales and marketing, and our inability to effectively utilize the services provided by these third parties would materially adversely impact our ability to generate sales.\nWe depend on independent sales representatives and distributors for the sale and marketing of certain of our products in international markets. Our contracts with distributors generally grant them the exclusive right to market our products in a specified territory and contain particular sales quotas. Our arrangements with our independent sales representatives and distributors typically do not preclude them from selling competitive products. Our success depends in part upon the expertise of our independent sales representatives and distributors and the acceptance of our products by our customers. Our inability to attract and retain qualified sales representatives and distributors would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nAs our international operations have grown, we have transitioned certain of our international sales operations from independent distributors to direct sales operations. During the period of this transition our expenses have increased, and our revenues and related operating profits have been negatively impacted. As the foregoing transition continues, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. If we are unable to effectively\nmanage significant distributor transitions, then we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are dependent on third-party technology, the loss of which would harm our business.\nThird parties provide us access to technologies that are used in our current products and in products under development. Consequently, we rely upon these third parties to develop, introduce and maintain technologies that continue to enhance our current products and enable us, in turn, to develop our own products on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet changing customer needs and technological trends in the orthopedic industry. In many cases, we do not have supply contracts with these technology suppliers, and we purchase from them on a purchase order basis; therefore, we do not have guaranteed access to such technologies for the intended lifecycles of the products in which such technologies are incorporated. Additionally, these technology suppliers may go out of business or may be subject to, among other things, injunctions, interruptions in supply, work stoppages or natural disasters, which prevent them from being able to supply their technologies to us. Additionally, particular technologies may evolve due to changes in industry standards or changes in the market, and, because we do not have long-term contractual commitments with certain of our technology suppliers, we may not have access to the evolved technologies. If we could not obtain required technology from a supplier, whether on reasonable terms or at all, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nAny impairment in our relationships with the licensors of technologies used in our products would force us to find other developers on a timely basis or develop our own technology, which could cause us to cease sales of the affected product for a significant period of time. For example, we estimate that it would take us from approximately 18 to 24 months to re-engineer and reintroduce a product if we lost our existing licenses to certain technologies used in some of our products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the third-party technology necessary to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products, that we will obtain third-party technology on commercially reasonable terms or that we will be able to replace third-party technology in the event such technology becomes unavailable, obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products. We would have severe difficulty competing if we could not obtain or replace the third-party technology used in our products. Any absence or delay in obtaining third-party technology necessary for our products would materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAcquisitions may result in disruptions to our business or distractions of our management due to the efforts required to integrate acquired personnel and operations, and there is no assurance that any such integration will proceed as planned.\nWe have historically acquired companies, technologies and products intended to expand our business, and we plan to do so in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of special problems and risks, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulty integrating acquired technologies, products, services, operations and personnel with the existing businesses;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty maintaining relationships with important third parties, including those relating to marketing alliances and providing preferred partner status and favorable pricing;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the businesses;\n\u00b7\nstrain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations;\n\u00b7\ninability to retain and motivate management and other key personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nexposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, as well as risk of potential litigation arising from such acquisitions;\n\u00b7\npotential costly and time-consuming litigation, including shareholder lawsuits;\n\u00b7\npotential issuance of securities to equity holders of the company being acquired with rights that are superior to the rights of holders of our common stock, or which may have a dilutive effect on our common shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe need to incur additional debt or use cash; and\n\u00b7\nthe requirement to record potentially significant additional future operating costs for the amortization of intangible assets.\nAs a result of our growth and intent to acquire businesses, we could experience significant strain on internal resources impacting the design and effectiveness of certain internal control processes. As a result of these or other problems and risks, businesses we acquire may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipated, and acquired products, services or technologies might not perform as we expected. As a result, we may incur higher costs and realize lower revenues than we had anticipated. We may not be able to successfully address these problems and we cannot assure you that the acquisitions will be successfully identified and completed or that, if acquisitions are completed, the acquired businesses, products, services or technologies will generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other harmful effects on our business.\nAny of these risks can be greater if an acquisition is large relative to the size of our company. Failure to effectively manage our growth through acquisitions could adversely affect our prospects, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant goodwill and other intangible assets. Consequently, potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles may significantly impact our profitability.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires us to annually evaluate whether certain assets have been impaired. Annually, and more frequently if a triggering event occurs, we must test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment using a fair-value-based approach. In addition, U.S. GAAP also requires us to evaluate the carrying value of all long-lived intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may exceed their recoverable amounts. An impairment loss on long-lived intangible assets other than goodwill is recognized when the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. One or more impairment losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel, or our inability to hire and retain qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our success.\nWe are highly dependent on the skills, experience and services of key personnel. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If Dr. William Petty, our Executive Chairman, unexpectedly terminates his employment with Exactech for any reason, his absence could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on key individuals. We expect that our anticipated growth and expansion will place increased demands on our management skills and resources. Therefore, our success also depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain additional skilled and experienced management personnel. Employment and retention of qualified personnel is important due to the competitive nature of our industry. Our inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could impair our ability to manage and operate our business effectively.\nOur business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the U.S. and internationally.\nWe are subject to complex and stringent healthcare, manufacturing, environmental, security, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate. In addition, our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, taxes and other restrictions and charges. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business. The impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted. Compliance with new and existing laws and regulations may continue to increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe international component of our business has been growing, and difficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business conditions could harm our business, including restrictions under our current credit facility.\nWe have expanded the international component of our business over the last number of years. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we generated 30%, 33% and 33% of our total revenues, respectively, in countries other than the United States. Some risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory, tax and political environments;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nfinancial instability of government payers in some markets;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to secure and maintain the necessary physical infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nchallenges in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nhealthcare laws and regulations may be more restrictive than those currently in place in the United States;\n\u00b7\nchanges in third-party reimbursement policy that may require some of the patients who receive our implant products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate our reducing selling prices for our products; and\n\u00b7\nour inability to successfully transition to a significant international platform, including the establishment of internal operational, supply and distribution capabilities.\nAdditionally, our current credit facility contains limits on the aggregate amount of funding that we may provide to our foreign subsidiaries, which may impair our ability to grow our international operations.\nAny one or more of these factors could materially and adversely affect revenues, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various laws relating to trade, export controls, and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations, reputation, business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nWe must comply with all applicable international trade, export and import laws and regulations of the United States and other countries, and we are subject to export controls and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by the U.S. Government. Changes in trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, referred to as the FCPA, and other anti-bribery laws that generally prohibit the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\nOur business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage practices by our employees and agents that would violate the FCPA and other applicable laws. However, we cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in significant fines (up to $2.0 million per violation of the anti-bribery provisions and fines and penalties of up to $25.0 million per violation for violations of the books and\nrecords requirements), criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, exclusion from government programs, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and our inability to market and sell our products in one or more countries. Additionally, any such violations could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.\nPrivacy concerns could result in regulatory changes and impose additional costs and liabilities on us, limit our use of information, and adversely affect our business.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States, Europe, and many other countries where we operate. Many federal, state, and foreign legislatures and government agencies have imposed or are considering imposing restrictions and requirements about the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from individuals. Changes to laws or regulations affecting privacy could impose additional costs and liability on us and could limit our use of such information to add value for customers. If we were required to change our business activities or revise or eliminate services, or to implement burdensome compliance measures, our business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties, and potential litigation if we fail to comply with applicable privacy regulations. The European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may adversely impact our ability to profitably operate in certain European countries. Regulatory burdens of this sort increase our costs and harm our financial results.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market has been volatile, fluctuating from a low of $16.11 per share to a high of $26.20 per share during the 52-week trading period ended February 26, 2016, and we may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly include, but are not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual results of operations;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nadverse regulatory or legal proceedings;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u00b7\nfuture issuances of common stock or other securities;\n\u00b7\nthe addition or departure of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances.\nThis volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause shareholders to lose some or all of their investment in our common stock.\nOur common shares are thinly traded and, therefore, relatively illiquid.\nAs of February 26, 2016, we had 14,027,809 common shares outstanding. While our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market, our stock is thinly traded (approximately 0.41%, or 57,437 shares, of our stock traded on an average daily basis during the 52 week trading period ended February 26, 2016) and you may have difficulty in selling your shares quickly. The low trading volume of our common stock is outside of our control, and may not increase in the future or, even if it does increase in the future, may not be maintained.\nExisting shareholders' interest in us may be diluted by additional issuances of equity securities.\nWe expect to issue additional equity securities to fund acquisitions and pursuant to employee benefit plans. We may also issue additional equity for other purposes. These securities we issue may have the same rights as our\ncommon stock or, alternatively, may have dividend, liquidation, or other preferences to our common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities will dilute the holdings of existing shareholders and may reduce the share price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid, and we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock, and investors will be able to receive cash in respect of their shares of common stock only upon the sale of the shares.\nWe have no intention in the foreseeable future to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, and our current credit facility contains certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Therefore, an investor in our common stock may obtain an economic benefit from the common stock only after an increase in its trading price and only by selling the common stock.\nDirectors, executive officers, principal shareholders and affiliated entities own a significant percentage of our capital stock, and they may make decisions that an investor may not consider to be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nOur directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and affiliated entities beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 29% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, if some or all of them acted together, they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over the election of our Board of Directors and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our shareholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be favored by other shareholders. This could prevent the consummation of transactions favorable to other shareholders, such as a transaction in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nOur business and customers may be subject to use taxes and other taxes.\nThe application of indirect taxes (such as use tax, value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax) to the surgical instrumentation we provide in connection with the orthopaedic implant devices we manufacture is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations are vague as to whether their application is appropriate in this arena. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the provision of surgical instrumentation. The application of such statutes and regulations, particularly as many states seek avenues with which they may expand revenues generated from broader taxes, could adversely affect our business as it would result in the imposition of use taxes, as well as costs associated with complex tax collection, remittance and audit compliance requirements on us and our dealers and would impact the cost profile of our surgical instrumentation. From time to time, some taxing authorities have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes. We are currently contesting these determinations. We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities to clarify our obligations under these laws and regulations.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our results of operation could be harmed. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. If it is determined that we are not in compliance with Section 404, we may be required to implement new internal control procedures and reevaluate our financial reporting. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses as well as increased independent auditor fees during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. Further, we may need to hire additional qualified personnel. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which could result in our being unable to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our independent auditors. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses, or divert management's attention from operating our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLaws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are subject to change, and new regulations may be promulgated by the SEC and the securities exchanges, including the NASDAQ Global Market, on which our common stock is or may be listed. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Our board members, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, we may incur additional expenses to comply with standards set by regulatory authorities or governing bodies which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 83503, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "EXAC"}
