Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects could be materially and adversely harmed if any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, actually occur. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks or uncertainties, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed at-length below. These risks include, among others, the following:\n\u2022The COVID-19 outbreak has had a material impact on the U.S. and global economies and could have a material adverse impact on our employees, suppliers, manufacturing and customers, which could adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We have incurred significant losses in the past and will likely experience losses in the future.\n\u2022We depend on sales in the healthcare market for the majority of our revenue, and a decrease in sales in the healthcare market would harm our business.\n\u2022Our sales cycle can be lengthy and unpredictable, which may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly.\n\u2022If we fail to offer high-quality products and services, our operating results and our ability to sell these in the future will be harmed.\n\u2022We depend on some sole source and limited source suppliers, and if we are unable to source our components from them, our business and operating results could be harmed.\n\u2022Because we depend on contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers, our operations could be harmed and we could lose sales if we encounter problems with these manufacturers.\n\u2022If we fail to forecast our manufacturing requirements accurately or fail to properly manage our inventory with our contract manufacturers, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays that could impact the timing of our revenue recognition and adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022Our business has gone through cycles of expansion, relative stability and contraction, and if we are not able to manage such cycles effectively, our operating results may suffer.\n\u2022Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated, and are likely to continue to fluctuate, making our quarterly results difficult to predict, which may cause us to miss analyst expectations and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\u2022Developments in the healthcare industry and governing regulations have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business.\n\u2022If we fail to increase market awareness of our brand and solutions, and expand our sales and marketing operations, our business could be harmed.\n\u2022Failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\u2022Our efforts to sell our solutions in non-healthcare markets may not be successful.\n\u2022Our international operations subject us, and may increasingly subject us in the future, to operational, financial, economic and political risks abroad.\n\u2022If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\n\u2022We have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes. The provisions of indenture for the Notes, accounting method for the Notes and capped call transaction entered into related to the Notes could have a material effect on our operating results, value of the Notes and our common stock or may deter or prevent a business combination.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has had a material impact on the U.S. and global economies and could have a material adverse impact on our employees, suppliers, manufacturing and customers, which could adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, is a global pandemic and both a public health and economic emergency. Many federal, state and local governments and private entities have mandated various restrictions, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. As the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and rapidly evolving, our business may be negatively affected for a prolonged period of time. Since our last filing, COVID-19 infections have continued and are increasing in many geographies of the world. These rates may continue to increase further. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe pandemic has affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our customers\u2019 operations, our employees and our employee productivity. It may impact the ability of our customers, subcontractors, partners, and suppliers to operate and fulfill their contractual obligations, and result in an increase in payment defaults, collection costs and/or delays or disruptions in performance. In particular, hospitals and healthcare facilities have prioritized the care and treatment of COVID-19 patients above all other actions and have suspended many activities, restricted most visitors and reduced spending unrelated to COVID-19. These customers have also had to suspend elective procedures, which generate a majority of their profits, adding to their financial difficulties. While some elective procedures have resumed, it is uncertain whether consumers will seek those procedures due to concerns about COVID-19, and it is also uncertain if elective procedures will be suspended again if cases increase. In response, some have furloughed staff, including those we ordinarily work with to sell and implement our offerings.\nOutside of healthcare, some of our clients in the hospitality and retail industries have suspended operations until stay-at-home orders are lifted, and potentially beyond. Even once lifted, as with healthcare, it is uncertain whether consumers will return to those establishments and how successful these businesses will be. As a result, we have experienced delays in planned deployments and changes in customer demand, and could experience additional delays, discounts, customer payment issues, bad debt, potential terminations and unpredictability as our customers continue to respond to the challenges of treating and containing the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have also experienced some disruptions in our supply chain and our manufacturers have similarly experienced disruptions in their supply chains. To the extent our suppliers prioritize the manufacturing of other products or experience facility or\nbusiness disruptions due to sick employees, stay-at-home orders, supply chain disruptions or otherwise, we may be unable to maintain a sufficient supply of our products to meet demand. Additionally, our employees, in many cases, are working remotely and using various technologies to perform their functions, which may create security risks, inefficiencies and reduced productivity, and reduce the effectiveness of our sales team.\nThese effects on our business, and the direct effect of the virus and the disruption on our employees and operations, may negatively impact our revenue, profit margins and liquidity. Additionally, the disruption and volatility in the global and domestic capital markets may increase the cost of capital and limit our ability to access capital.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel, customer visits, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences which are important to support our sales approach, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations or within any of our business activities could result in reduced revenue. We could also be adversely affected if government authorities impose additional restrictions or extend the length of restrictions on public gatherings, human interactions, mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures, restrict hours of operations or impose curfews, restrict the import or export of products or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nBoth the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 virus are highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. For these reasons and other reasons that may come to light as the coronavirus pandemic and associated protective or preventative measures develop, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business operations, revenues and financial condition; however, its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nWe have incurred significant losses in the past and will likely experience losses in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in the past and reported a net loss of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $160.0 million. If we cannot make consistent progress toward future profitability, our business and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to be profitable in the future depends upon continued demand for our solutions from existing and new customers. Further adoption of our solutions depends upon our ability to improve quality of care, enhance patient and staff satisfaction, increase hospital efficiency and productivity, and bring value to customers outside of healthcare. In addition, our profitability will be affected by, among other things, our ability to execute on our business strategy, the timing and size of orders, the pricing and costs of our solutions, competitive offerings, macroeconomic conditions affecting the health care industry and the extent to which we invest in sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative resources.\nWe depend on sales in the healthcare market for the majority of our revenue, and a decrease in sales in the healthcare market would harm our business.\nTo date, substantially all of our revenue has been derived from sales to the healthcare market and, in particular, hospitals. Sales to the healthcare market accounted for 98%, 96% and 97% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We anticipate that sales to the healthcare market will represent a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.\nMost of our solutions require a substantial upfront investment by new customers. The cost of the initial deployment depends on the number of users and departments involved, the size and age of the hospital and the condition of the existing wireless infrastructure, if any, within the hospital. Even if hospital personnel determine that our solutions provide compelling benefits over their existing communications methods, their hospitals may not have, or may not be willing to spend, the resources necessary to install and maintain wireless infrastructure to initially deploy and support our solutions or expand our solutions to other departments or users. Hospitals face significant budget constraints from the COVID-19 pandemic, as they have had to postpone elective procedures that provide a significant portion of their revenue. Hospital budgets are also constrained by unpredictable patient population trends and commercial reimbursements, and increasing demands from, and competition for, patients. In addition, both governmental and commercial hospitals are experiencing lower Medicare reimbursement rates and higher compliance demands, which add to these budget pressures. Also as part of the tax reform law that came into effect in December 2017, the tax penalty for violating the individual health insurance mandate under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) was set to zero effective in 2019, essentially repealing it. In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision that held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme Court will rule on this case or how healthcare measures of any new administration will impact the ACA and our business. It is uncertain if there will be changes to the ACA with any new administration, but there have been attempts in the past to repeal or amend the ACA, as well as continue to undertake other healthcare reforms. As a consequence of these regulatory and other factors, hospitals may delay or reduce their\nspending, which may cause slowdowns and deferral of orders for our solutions, or customers may choose other less expensive solutions, both of which could negatively impact our sales. We might not be able to sustain or increase our revenue from sales of our solutions, or achieve the growth rates that we envision, if hospitals continue to face significant budgetary constraints and reduce their spending on communications systems.\nOur sales cycle can be lengthy and unpredictable, which may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur sales cycles can be lengthy and unpredictable. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits of our solutions, including the technical capabilities of our solutions and the potential cost savings and productivity gains achievable by deploying them. Customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process, which frequently involves not only our solutions but also their existing communications methods and those of our competitors and can result in a lengthy sales cycle that sometimes exceeds twelve months. We spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce sales. Similarly, our increasing dependence on larger, hospital-wide deployments may increase fluctuations in our revenue and operating results because the failure to complete a significant sale, or the loss of a large customer, will have a greater impact on those results. In addition, purchases of our solutions are frequently subject to budget constraints and shifts, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. We have experienced and may continue to experience elongated sales cycles due to ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as past and future healthcare reform legislation, the impact of shifting federal government budgets, changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential future statutes and rulemaking.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality products and services, our operating results and our ability to sell these in the future will be harmed.\nOur ability to sell our solutions depends on our ability to offer high-quality product and services. Our solutions incorporate complex technology, are deployed in a variety of complex hospital environments and must interoperate with many different types of devices and hospital systems. While we test the components of our solutions for defects and errors prior to release, we or our customers may not discover a defect or error until after we have deployed our solution, integrated it into the hospital environment and our customer has commenced general use of the solution. In addition, our solutions in some cases are integrated with hardware and software offered by \u201cmiddleware\u201d vendors to interoperate with nurse call systems, device alarms and other hospital systems. Our software may be partnered with third party software to provide for potential joint solutions with such third party. Our software may also be deployed on third party devices, including devices we resell, which creates additional complexity because we share control of the customer experience. If we cannot successfully integrate our solutions with these vendors as needed or if any hardware or software of these vendors contains any defect or error, then our solutions may not perform as designed, or may exhibit a defect or error.\nOur professional services team assists our customers with their wireless infrastructure assessment, clinical workflow design, communication solution configuration, clinical integration, training and project management during the pre-deployment and deployment stages. Once our solutions are deployed within a customer\u2019s facility, the customer typically depends on our technical support team to help resolve technical issues, assist in optimizing the use of our solutions and facilitate adoption of new functionality. If we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our solutions, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve technical and other post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support services, our ability to expand the use of our solutions with existing customers and to sell our solutions to new customers will be harmed. If deployment of our solutions is deemed unsatisfactory, we may incur significant costs to attain and sustain customer satisfaction or, in extreme cases, our customers may choose not to deploy our solutions. As we hire new services and support personnel, we may inadvertently hire underperforming people who will have to be replaced, or fail to effectively train such employees, leading in some instances to slower growth, additional costs and poor customer relations. In addition, the failure of channel partners to provide high-quality services and support in markets outside the United States could also harm sales of our solutions.\nAny defects or errors in, or which are attributed to our solutions, or to products or services we resell, could result in:\n\u2022delayed market acceptance of our affected solutions;\n\u2022loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition;\n\u2022loss of customers or inability to attract new customers;\n\u2022diversion of engineering or other resources for remedying the defect or error;\n\u2022damage to our brand and reputation;\n\u2022delay in delivery of information;\n\u2022increased service and warranty costs, including potential replacement costs for product recalls or returns; and\n\u2022legal actions by our customers and hospital patients, including product liability claims.\nIf any of these occur, our operating results and reputation could be harmed.\nAs we continue to pursue opportunities for larger deals that have greater technical complexity, including deals that require more complex integrations with our customer\u2019s workflows, we may experience a longer time period for our solutions to deploy and as a result, our revenue recognition for these deals may be delayed. These complex deployments may also be delayed as our customers focus on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, as we enter agreements with new and existing customers for larger and more complex deals across multiple sites, we have been, and may continue to be, required to agree to customer acceptance and cancellation clauses. With acceptance clauses, delays may occur in obtaining customer acceptance regardless of the quality of our products and services, and may cause us to defer revenue recognition where such acceptance provisions are substantive in nature, or they may require us to incur additional professional services or other costs in an effort to obtain such customer acceptance. Cancellation clauses may result in a customer canceling an order for our hardware, software and services, which could impact our revenue.\nWe depend on some sole source and limited source suppliers, and if we are unable to source our components from them, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe depend on sole and limited source suppliers for several hardware components of our solutions, including our batteries and integrated circuits. We purchase inventory generally through individual purchase orders. Any of these suppliers could cease production of our components, cease to provide the necessary levels of support for our use of their components, experience capacity constraints, material shortages, work stoppages, epidemics or contagious diseases, such as the coronavirus outbreak, that negatively impact them and their suppliers, financial difficulties, cost increases or other reductions or disruptions in output, cease operations or be acquired by or enter into exclusive arrangements with, a competitor. For example, we have experienced periodic delays in deliveries from our suppliers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These suppliers typically rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with their suppliers, and as a result, the supplier may not be able to secure sufficient materials at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build our components in a timely manner. Any of these circumstances could cause interruptions or delays in the delivery of our solutions to our customers, and this may force us to seek components from alternative sources, which may not have the required specifications, or be available in time to meet demand or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any of these circumstances may also force us to redesign our solutions to incorporate a component from an alternative source if a component becomes unavailable.\nOur solutions incorporate multiple software components obtained from licensors on a non-exclusive basis, such as voice recognition software, software supporting the runtime execution of our software platform, and database and reporting software. Our license agreements can be terminated for cause. In many cases, these license agreements specify a limited term and are only renewable beyond that term with the consent of the licensor. If a licensor terminates a license agreement for cause, objects to its renewal or conditions renewal on modified terms and conditions, we may be unable to obtain licenses for equivalent software components on reasonable terms and conditions, including licensing fees, warranties or protection from infringement claims. Some licensors may discontinue licensing their software to us or support of the software version used in our solutions. In such circumstances, we may need to redesign our solutions with substantial cost and time investment to incorporate alternative software components or be subject to higher royalty costs. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect the cost and availability of our solutions.\nThird-party licensors generally require us to incorporate specific license terms and conditions in our agreements with our customers. If we are alleged to have failed to incorporate these license terms and conditions, we may be subject to claims by these licensors, incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such claims and, if such claims are successful, be subject to termination of licenses, monetary damages, or an injunction against the continued distribution of one or more of our solutions.\nBecause we depend on contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers, our operations could be harmed and we could lose sales if we encounter problems with these manufacturers.\nWe do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely upon two contract manufacturers, Sercomm and SMTC, to make our wearable devices. We have entered into manufacturing agreements with Sercomm and SMTC that are terminable by either party with advance notice and may also be terminated for a material uncured breach. We expect to enter into additional contract manufacturing agreements as we expand our business. We also rely on original design manufacturers, or ODMs, to produce accessories, including batteries, chargers and attachments. Any of these suppliers could cease production of our components, cease to provide the necessary levels of support for our use of their components, experience capacity constraints, material shortages, work stoppages, epidemics or contagious diseases that negatively impact them and their suppliers, financial difficulties, cost increases or other reductions or disruptions in output, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, a competitor. If Sercomm, SMTC, or another contract manufacturer or an ODM is unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing components of our solutions in the volumes and timeframes that we require, fails to meet our quality specifications or significantly increases its prices, we may not be able to deliver our solutions to our customers with\nthe quantities, quality and performance that they expect in a timely manner. As a result, we could lose sales and our operating results could be harmed.\nSercomm, SMTC, other contract manufacturers or ODMs may experience problems that could impact the quantity and quality of hardware components of our solution, including disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, component or material shortages and cost increases. The majority of the hardware components of our solution are manufactured in Asia or Mexico, and adverse changes in political or economic circumstances, or health related issues such as epidemics or contagious diseases, in those locations could also disrupt our supply and quality of components of our solutions. In addition, U.S. government officials have imposed changes in trade, tariffs, fiscal and tax policies and may do so in the future, and any such changes in the U.S. or in other countries from which we source components of our products could adversely affect our business.\nCompanies occasionally encounter unexpected difficulties in ramping up production of new products, and we may experience such difficulties with future generations of our products. Sercomm, SMTC, other contract manufacturers and our ODMs also manufacture products for other companies. Generally, our orders represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by Sercomm, SMTC, other contract manufacturers and these ODMs from their customers; therefore, fulfilling our orders may not be a priority in the event Sercomm, SMTC, other contract manufacturers or an ODM is constrained in its ability to fulfill all of its customer obligations. In addition, if Sercomm, SMTC, other contract manufacturers or an ODM is unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing components of our solutions, we may have to identify one or more alternative manufacturers. The process of identifying and qualifying a new contract manufacturer or ODM can be time consuming, and we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost. Additionally, transitioning to a new manufacturer may cause us to incur additional costs and delays if the new manufacturer has difficulty manufacturing components of our solutions to our specifications or quality standards.\nIf we fail to forecast our manufacturing requirements accurately or fail to properly manage our inventory with our contract manufacturer, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays that could impact the timing of our revenue recognition and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe place orders with our contract manufacturers, including Sercomm and SMTC, and we and our contract manufacturers place orders with suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand. Because of our international low-cost sourcing strategy, our lead times are long and cause substantially more risk to forecasting accuracy than would result were lead times shorter. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce errors into our estimates affecting our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands for our solutions. We also may face additional forecasting challenges due to new product introductions, product transitions in the components of our solutions, or to our suppliers discontinuing production of materials and subcomponents required for our solutions. If demand for our solutions increases significantly, we may not be able to meet demand on a timely basis, and we may need to expend a significant amount of time working with our customers to allocate limited supply and maintain positive customer relations, or we may incur additional costs in order to source additional materials and subcomponents to produce components of our solutions or to expedite the manufacture and delivery of additional inventory. If we underestimate customer demand, we and our contract manufacturer may have inadequate materials and subcomponents on hand to produce components of our solutions, which could result in manufacturing interruptions, shipment delays, deferral or loss of revenue, and damage to our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we and our contract manufacturers may purchase more inventory than required for actual customer orders, resulting in excess or obsolete inventory, thereby increasing our costs and harming our operating results.\nIf we fail to successfully develop and introduce new solutions and features to existing solutions, our revenue, operating results and reputation could suffer.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to develop and introduce new solutions and to add features to existing solutions that meet existing and new customer requirements. We may not be able to develop and introduce new solutions or features on a timely basis or in response to customers\u2019 changing requirements. Similarly, our new solutions and features may not sufficiently differentiate us from competing solutions such that customers can justify deploying our solutions. We expect to incur costs associated with the development and introduction of new solutions before the anticipated benefits or the returns are realized, if at all. We may experience technical problems and additional costs as we introduce new features to our software platform, deploy future models of our wireless badges, or deploy new smartphone apps, which can require customers to perform software upgrades to their systems, and integrate new solutions with existing customer clinical systems and workflows. In addition, we may face technical difficulties as we expand into non-English speaking countries and incorporate non-English speech recognition capabilities into our solutions. We also may incur substantial costs or delays in the manufacture of any additional new products or models as we seek to optimize production methods and processes at our contract manufacturers. In addition, we expect that we may at least initially achieve lower gross margins on new models, while endeavoring to reduce\nmanufacturing costs over time. If any of these problems were to arise, our revenue, operating results and reputation could suffer.\nOur business has gone through cycles of expansion, relative stability and contraction, and if we are not able to manage such cycles effectively, our operating results may suffer.\nWe have experienced periods of expansion, relative stability and contraction in our revenues and operations in the past. Such fluctuations have placed, and may continue to place, strains on our management systems, infrastructure and other resources. Especially during growth periods, we hire additional direct sales, professional services and marketing personnel domestically and internationally, acquire complementary businesses, technologies or assets, and increase our investment in research and development. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully implement such plans and manage such investments. To do so successfully we must, among other things:\n\u2022manage our expenses in line with our operating plans and current business environment;\n\u2022maintain and enhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022integrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets;\n\u2022manage operations in multiple locations and time zones; and\n\u2022develop and deliver new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions efficiently and reliably.\nWe expect to incur costs associated with the investments made to support our business strategy before the anticipated benefits or the returns are realized, if any. If we are unable to grow our business or manage our future growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions. We may also fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain quality, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in lower revenue and a decline in the share price of our common stock.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated, and are likely to continue to fluctuate, making our quarterly results difficult to predict, which may cause us to miss analyst expectations and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur operating results have been and may continue to be difficult to predict, even in the near term, and are likely to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nComparisons of our revenue and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Each of the following factors, among others, could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter:\n\u2022the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the financial health of our healthcare customers and budgetary constraints on their ability to upgrade their communications, particularly in light of the pandemic;\n\u2022the availability of government funding for healthcare facilities operated by the United States federal, state and local governments;\n\u2022changes in customer purchasing patterns or sales cycles;\n\u2022market acceptance of our Smartbadge and its impact on orders for our existing Badge and related software;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory environment affecting our healthcare customers, including impediments to their ability to obtain reimbursement for their services;\n\u2022our ability to expand and improve our sales and marketing operations;\n\u2022our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets;\n\u2022the announcement of new significant contracts or relationships;\n\u2022the procurement and deployment cycles of our healthcare customers and the length of our sales cycles;\n\u2022changes in how healthcare operating and capital budgets are administered within the enterprise;\n\u2022changes in customer deployment timelines;\n\u2022variations in the amount of orders booked in a prior quarter but not delivered until later quarters;\n\u2022our mix of solutions and the varying revenue recognition rules that apply;\n\u2022pricing, including discounts by us or our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to expand into non-healthcare markets;\n\u2022our ability to develop significant new reseller relationships and maintain existing reseller relationships;\n\u2022the financial health of our resellers;\n\u2022our ability to successfully deploy our solutions in a timely manner;\n\u2022our ability to sell and integrate third-party products and services, and our customer\u2019s satisfaction with those third-party products and services;\n\u2022our ability to forecast demand and manage lead times for the manufacture of our solutions;\n\u2022our ability to develop and introduce new solutions and features to existing solutions that achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022the announcement of a new product, which may cause sales cycles to lengthen;\n\u2022federal government shutdowns;\n\u2022occurrence of health epidemics or contagious diseases and potential effects on our business and manufacturing operations;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currencies in the international markets in which we operate; and\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies.\nWe primarily compete in the rapidly evolving and competitive healthcare market, and if we fail to effectively respond to competitive pressures, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nOur prospective customers primarily use legacy communication solutions such as wired and wireless phones, pagers and overhead intercoms. We believe that our system is superior to these legacy methods. Manufacturers and distributors of product categories such as cellular phones, pagers, mobile radios and in-building wireless telephones continue to sell their products to hospitals. In addition, the growing proliferation of smartphones and related applications, including cloud-based applications, represents another category of competitive offerings. Furthermore, our clinical integrations and middleware solutions compete with a variety of companies that offer clinical integration technology. Similarly we may face a different set of competitors in our patient and family engagement solutions.\nWe believe currently there is no directly comparable single competitor that provides a solution for the healthcare market as richly-featured as ours, but we could face such competition in the future. Potential competitors in the healthcare or communications markets include large, multinational companies with significantly more resources to dedicate to product development and sales and marketing. These companies, which may include electronic health record vendors or other large software and healthcare IT companies, may have existing relationships within the hospital, which may enhance their ability to gain a foothold in our market. For example, some of the electronic health record vendors offer secure text messaging as an additional service and have said they plan to expand these offerings to complete more directly with us. Some customers may prefer to purchase a more highly integrated or bundled solution from a single provider or an existing supplier rather than a new supplier, regardless of performance or features. Accordingly, if we fail to effectively respond to competitive pressures, we could experience pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, higher sales and marketing expenses, lower revenue and the loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIf we do not achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits from our acquisitions or if we cannot successfully integrate them, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have acquired, and in the future may acquire, complementary businesses, technologies or assets that we believe to be strategic. For example, we recently acquired EASE Applications, LLC, or EASE Applications, a cloud-based communication platform and mobile application, to help enhance our care team communication with patients and families. We may not achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits, or be successful in integrating EASE Applications or any acquired businesses, technologies or assets. If we cannot effectively integrate the acquired business and products into our business, we may not achieve market acceptance for, or derive significant revenue from, these new solutions.\nIntegrating newly acquired businesses, technologies and assets could strain our resources, could be expensive and time consuming, and might not be successful. Our recent acquisitions expose us, and we will be further exposed, if we acquire or invest in additional businesses, technologies or assets, to a number of risks, including that we may:\n\u2022experience technical issues as we integrate acquired businesses, technologies or assets into our existing solutions;\n\u2022encounter difficulties leveraging our existing sales and marketing organizations, and direct sales channels, to increase our revenue from acquired businesses, technologies or assets;\n\u2022find that the acquisition does not further our business strategy, we overpaid for the acquisition or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision have changed;\n\u2022have difficulty retaining key personnel of acquired businesses;\n\u2022suffer disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management\u2019s attention as a result of transition or integration issues and the challenges of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises;\n\u2022experience unforeseen and significant problems or liabilities associated with quality, technology and legal contingencies relating to the acquisition, such as intellectual property or employment matters; and\n\u2022incur substantial costs to integrate the acquired business.\nIf we were to proceed with one or more additional significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options and warrants, the ownership of existing stockholders would be diluted. In addition,\nacquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, large write-offs, or other unanticipated costs, events or circumstances, any of which could harm our operating results.\nIn addition, from time to time we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. These negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs.\nWe could be required to record adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets, including goodwill, that could significantly impact our operating results.\nOur balance sheet includes significant intangible assets, including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. The determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets have been impaired involves significant judgment and is subject to certain factors and events over which we have no control. The introduction of new competitive products or services into our markets could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions that adversely affect the competitiveness of our products and services. Further, declines in our market capitalization may be an indicator that our intangible assets or goodwill carrying values exceed their fair values, which could lead to potential impairment charges that could impact our operating results.\nDevelopments in the healthcare industry and governing regulations have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from customers in the healthcare industry, in particular, hospitals. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Developments generally affecting the healthcare industry, including new regulations or new interpretations of existing regulations, could adversely affect spending on information technology and capital equipment by reducing funding, changing healthcare pricing or delivery or creating impediments for obtaining healthcare reimbursements, which together with declining admission trends, could cause our sales to decline and negatively impact our business. For example, the margins of our hospital customers are modest, and potential decreases in reimbursement for healthcare costs may reduce the overall solvency of our customers or cause further deterioration in their financial or business condition.\nIn the past bills were signed into law that impact the U.S. healthcare system, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Uncertainty surrounding the status of the ACA and its regulations may impact the spending of our healthcare customers, and we cannot predict the effect on our business of any new legislation and regulations that may be adopted if the ACA is significantly changed or repealed or of additional regulations.\nFederal budget activities also impact our customers. Our customers include healthcare facilities run by the Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we generated approximately 18%, 17% and 18%, respectively, of our revenue from these customers. Our reseller to the Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs represented 33% and 19% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These customers have been and may continue to be impacted by budgetary and legislative actions.\nIn the past certain departments of the U.S. federal government temporarily stopped operating as a result of failure by the legislative and executive branches of the government to pass bills to keep them operating. There is a risk that the government could be shut down again. Any past or future shutdown may impact our US government customers\u2019 spending decisions, as well as those of our non-US government customers. Any reduction or delay in our customers\u2019, or potential customers\u2019 spending decisions may result in a delay, or reduction, to our revenue.\nIn addition, many state governments are changing or expanding their healthcare laws, adding additional complexity to understanding the potential impacts.\nWe are unable to predict the full impact of these new and changing rules on our hospital customers and others in the healthcare industry. Impacts of these rules have affected and could continue to affect materially our customers\u2019 ability to budget for or purchase our products. The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. We cannot provide assurance that the markets for our solutions will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nIf we fail to increase market awareness of our brand and solutions, and expand our sales and marketing operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to add personnel and resources in sales and marketing as we focus on expanding awareness of our brand and solutions and capitalize on sales opportunities with new and existing customers. Our efforts to improve sales of our\nsolutions will result in an increase in our sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense, and these efforts may not be successful. Some newly hired sales and marketing personnel may subsequently be determined to be unproductive and have to be replaced, resulting in operational and sales delays and incremental costs. If we are unable to significantly increase the awareness of our brand and solutions or effectively manage the costs associated with these efforts, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and our supply chain. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. In the ordinary course of our business, we also collect, store, process, use and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including intellectual property, protected health information, proprietary business information and personal information. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Most of our workforce is currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also increases risks related to information security. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect confidential information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. The risk of a security breach or disruption or data loss, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. Although we maintain cybersecurity insurance, if our systems are breached or suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may significantly suffer and we may be subject to litigation, government enforcement actions or potential liability beyond our insurance coverage. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media and/or affected individuals pursuant to various federal, state (including regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws) and international privacy (including GDPR) and security laws, if applicable, including HIPAA or HITECH and its implementing rules and regulations. Security breaches could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations, adversely impact customer relationships, damage our reputation and divert attention of management and key information technology resources.\nEarlier this year, one of our vendors, SolarWinds, was the victim of a cyberattack that inserted a vulnerability in their platform. We use SolarWinds services for our internal corporate network so this introduced a potential vulnerability in our internal systems. We have removed the vulnerable software from our network and have not found any indication that the vulnerability was exploited. There are still uncertainties about the full scope of this cyberattack and we may learn of other vulnerabilities and potential network intrusions by third parties.\nIf hospitals do not have and are not willing to install, upgrade and maintain the wireless and other information technology infrastructure required to effectively operate our solutions, then they may experience technical problems or not purchase our solutions at all.\nThe effectiveness of our solutions depends upon the quality and compatibility of the communications environment that our healthcare customers maintain. Our solutions require voice-grade wireless (Wi-Fi) installed through large enterprise environments, which can vary from hospital to hospital and from department to department within a hospital. Many hospitals have not installed a voice-grade wireless infrastructure. If potential customers do not have a wireless network that can properly and fully interoperate with our solutions, then such a network must be installed, or an existing Wi-Fi network must be upgraded or modified, for example, by adding access points in stairwells, for our solutions to be fully functional. The additional costs of installing or upgrading a Wi-Fi network may dissuade potential customers from installing our solutions. Furthermore, if changes to a customer\u2019s physical or information technology environment cause integration issues or degrade the effectiveness of our solutions, or if the customer fails to upgrade or maintain its environment as may be required for software deployments, releases and updates, the customer may not be able to fully utilize our solutions or may experience technical problems, or these changes may impact the performance of other wireless equipment being used. If such circumstances arise, prospective\ncustomers may not purchase or existing customers may not expand their use of or deploy upgraded versions of our solutions, thereby harming our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain certification for certain U.S. federal standards, our sales to U.S. government customers will suffer.\nWe believe that a significant opportunity exists to continue to sell our products to healthcare facilities in the Veterans Administration and Department of Defense (DoD). These customers require independent certification of compliance with specific requirements relating to encryption, security, interoperability and scalability, including Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 and, as to DoD, certification by its Joint Interoperability and Test Command and under its Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process. We have received certification under certain of these standards for military-specific configurations of our solution incorporating our Badge, but we do not have these certifications for our new Smartbadge. We continue to carry out further compliance activities and recertifications, as required. A failure on our part to achieve and maintain compliance and to respond to new threats and vulnerabilities, both as to current products and as to new product versions, could adversely impact our revenue.\nOur efforts to sell our solutions in non-healthcare markets may not be successful.\nIn recent years, we have actively engaged in sales efforts to customers outside the healthcare markets, including hospitality, retail, energy, education and other mobile work environments. We may not be successful in further penetrating the non-healthcare markets upon which we are initially focusing, or other new markets. To date, our solutions have been selected by over 400 customers in non-healthcare markets. Total revenue from non-healthcare customers accounted for 3%, 4% and 3% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If we cannot maintain these customers by providing solutions that meet their requirements, if we cannot successfully expand our solutions in non-healthcare markets, or if adoption of our solutions remains slow, we may not obtain significant revenue from these markets. We may experience challenges as we expand in non-healthcare markets, including pricing pressure on our solutions, budget constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic and technical issues as we adapt our solutions for the requirements of new markets. For example, some of our hospitality and retail customers have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and they have been forced to close locations and face significant revenue declines. Our solutions also may not contain the functionality required by these non-healthcare markets or may be too expensive or may not sufficiently differentiate us from competing solutions such that customers can justify deploying our solutions.\nWe generally recognize revenue from maintenance and support contracts and subscription arrangements over the contract term, and changes in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from our customer subscription and support contracts, extended warranty contracts and subscription arrangements ratably over the contract term, which is typically 12 months, in some cases subject to an early termination right. Revenue from our subscription and support contracts accounted for 40%, 38% and 35% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription and support contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscription and support, extended warranty contracts or subscription agreements by our customers in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to grow our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the continuing services of our senior management and other key personnel, and our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly in engineering, sales and marketing. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the technology field. If we fail to create work environments viewed as attractive and integrate and retain key personnel our ability to grow our business could be harmed.\nThe members of our senior management and other key personnel are at-will employees and may terminate their employment at any time without notice. If one or more members of our senior management terminate their employment, we may not be able to find qualified individuals to replace them on a timely basis or at all, and our senior management may need to divert their attention from other aspects of our business. Former employees may also become employees of a competitor. We may also have to pay additional compensation to attract and retain key personnel. We also anticipate hiring additional engineering,\nmarketing and sales, and services personnel to grow our business. Often, significant amounts of time and resources are required to train these personnel. We may incur significant costs to attract, integrate and retain them, and we may lose them to a competitor or another company before we realize the benefit of our investments in them.\nOur international operations subject us, and may increasingly subject us in the future, to operational, financial, economic and political risks abroad.\nAlthough we derive a relatively small portion of our revenue from customers outside the United States, we believe that non-U.S. customers could represent an increasing share of our revenue in the future. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we generated 10.7%, 8.7% and 10.2% of our revenue, respectively, from customers outside of the United States, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Middle Eastern countries including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. We also operate an innovation center in India and a sales office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Accordingly, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our business solely in the United States, including:\n\u2022challenges incorporating non-English speech recognition capabilities into our solutions if we expand into non-English speaking markets;\n\u2022difficulties integrating our solutions with wireless infrastructures with which we do not have experience;\n\u2022difficulties integrating local dialing plans and applicable PBX standards;\n\u2022challenges associated with delivering support, training and documentation in several languages;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing personnel and resellers;\n\u2022the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including increasingly stringent data privacy regulations, requirements for export controls for encryption technology, employment laws, changes in tax laws and tax audits by government agencies;\n\u2022political and economic instability in, or foreign conflicts that involve or affect, the countries of our customers;\n\u2022the impacts associated with epidemics or contagious diseases;\n\u2022adverse effects on us directly, or on our customers and suppliers, of changes in trade, fiscal or tax policies, including the imposition of tariffs;\n\u2022difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles;\n\u2022exposure to competitors who are more familiar with local markets;\n\u2022risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance;\n\u2022difficulties associated with resolving contract disputes in foreign countries with varied legal systems;\n\u2022limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection in some countries; and\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could affect the price of our solutions relative to locally produced solutions.\nAny of these factors could harm our existing international business, impair our ability to expand into international markets or harm our operating results.\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information collected through our solutions.\nIn connection with our healthcare business, we handle and have access to \u201cProtected Health Information\u201d or \u201cPHI\u201d subject in the United States to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) as amended and supplemented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (\u201cHITECH\u201d) , regulations issued pursuant to these statutes, state privacy and security laws and regulations, and associated contractual obligations as a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of healthcare providers. These statutes, regulations and contractual obligations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of PHI with which we must comply. Among other things, HITECH made certain aspects of HIPAA\u2019s rules, notably the \u201cHIPAA Security Rule,\u201d directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI in connection with providing a function on behalf of, or a service to, a covered entity (e.g., health care communication solutions). HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce the federal HIPAA regulation and seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office for Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d) has increased its focus on compliance and continues to train state attorneys general for enforcement purposes. The OCR has recently increased both its efforts to audit HIPAA compliance and its level of enforcement, with one recent penalty exceeding $16 million. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these statutes, regulations and contractual obligations as we develop our solutions, a failure by us to comply with their requirements (e.g., evolving encryption and security requirements) or an allegation that defects in our products have resulted in noncompliance by our customers could create material civil and/or criminal liability for us, resulting in adverse publicity and negatively affecting our business.\nIn addition, the use and disclosure of personal health information is subject to laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we do business or expect to do business in the future. Any developments stemming from enactment or modification of these laws and regulations, or the failure by us to comply with their requirements or to accurately anticipate the application or interpretation of these laws could create material liability to us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nFor example, in May 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR greatly increased the European Commission\u2019s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal information, including, for example, requirements to establish a legal basis for processing, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal information, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, requirements to implement safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information that requires the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards, shortened timelines for data breach notifications to appropriate data protection authorities or data subjects, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and additional requirements that we impose certain contractual obligations on third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal information. EU member states are tasked under the GDPR to enact, and have enacted, certain implementing legislation that adds to and/or further interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states governing the processing of personal information, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal information. In particular, the GDPR includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of individuals to whom the personal information relates, the transfer of personal information out of the European Economic Area, security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal information. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or \u20ac20 million, whichever is greater, and other administrative penalties. Additionally, the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) implemented the Data Protection Act effective in May 2018 and statutorily amended in 2019, that substantially implements the GDPR and contains provisions, including UK-specific derogations, for how GDPR is applied in the UK. Since the beginning of 2021 (when the transitional period following Brexit expired), we also have to continue to comply with the GDPR and the Data Protection Act, with each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of \u20ac20 million (\u00a317 million) or 4% of global turnover. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for them. Changes in these legislations may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources for compliance programs, could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.\nAny legislation or regulation in the area of privacy and security of personal information could affect the way we operate our services and could harm our business. For example, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal information out of the EU to the United States. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. In addition, these rules are consistently under scrutiny. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the Court of Justice) invalidated the European Union-United States (EU-U.S.) Privacy Shield on the grounds that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal information transferred to the United States. While the Court of Justice upheld the use of other data transfer mechanisms, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses, the decision has led to some uncertainty regarding the use of such mechanisms for data transfers to the United States, and the court made clear that reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. The use of Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal information specifically to the United States also remains under review by a number of European data protection supervisory authorities. For example, German and Irish supervisory authorities have indicated that the Standard Contractual Clauses alone provide inadequate protection for EU-U.S. data transfers. Use of the data transfer mechanisms must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. The European Data Protection Board (the EDPB) issued additional guidance regarding the Court of Justice\u2019s decision on November 11, 2020 which imposes higher burdens on the use of data transfer mechanisms, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses, for cross-border data transfers.\nTo comply with this guidance, we may need to implement additional safeguards to further enhance the security of data transferred out of the EU, which could increase our compliance costs, expose us to further regulatory scrutiny and liability, and adversely affect our business. Further, the European Commission published new versions of the Standard Contractual Clauses for comment. While the comment period ended in December 2020, the European Commission is expected to finalize and implement the new Standard Contractual Clauses in early 2021. Additionally, other countries (e.g., Australia and Japan) have adopted certain legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information. These obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. Further, since the transition period for Brexit ended December 31, 2020, there remains some uncertainty regarding cross-border data transfers from the EU to the United Kingdom. The EU is expected to either issue an adequacy decision for\nsuch transfers in early 2021, or an adequacy mechanism such as the Standard Contractual Clauses will be required for transfer of personal information from the EU to the United Kingdom. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our solutions or increase the costs associated with selling our solutions and may affect our ability to invest in or jointly develop solutions in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. If we are required to implement additional measures to transfer data from the EU, this could increase our compliance costs, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we cannot guarantee that our privacy and security policies and practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information.\nIn the U.S., California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, on June 28, 2018, which took effect on January 1, 2020, and became enforceable by the California Attorney General on July 1, 2020, along with related regulations which came into force on August 14, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt out of certain sales of personal information, right to request correction, access, and deletion of their personal information, the right to opt out of certain personal information sharing, and the right to receive detailed information about how their personal information is processed. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. Although the CCPA includes limited exceptions from its prescriptions, including exceptions for PHI collected by covered entities or business associates subject to HIPAA, among others, the CCPA may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., and, indeed, a number of state legislatures are considering privacy and/or data protection laws, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Additionally, California voters recently approved the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. While the CPRA will not take effect until January 2023, it will establish a California privacy regulator before that date. The CCPA and the CPRA may significantly impact our business activities and require substantial compliance costs that adversely affect business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. The interplay of federal and state laws (e.g., in addition to California, Massachusetts and Nevada have adopted laws requiring the implementation of certain security measures to protect personal information, and all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam, have adopted breach notification laws) may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy, security and data use issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to products and services could intensify.\nIf our efforts to protect the security of information collected by our customers are unsuccessful, we could become subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our sales and reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our customers, including personal information and PHI. We have implemented programs to detect and alert us to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Companies are increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to malfeasance by employees, consultants or other service providers to state-sponsored attacks. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom crafted against our information systems. In recent times, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, malfeasance, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employees, consultants or other service providers. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors and temporary staff. If we experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation, as well as potentially incur significant costs and diversion of resources to comply with our contractual obligations to notify our customers of such security breaches, particularly with respect to any protected health information affected. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, our reputation could be materially damaged. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media and/or affected individuals pursuant to various federal, state and international\nprivacy and security laws, if applicable, including HIPAA or HITECH and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability under laws, regulations and contracts that protect the privacy and security of personal information. For example, as stated above, the CCPA imposes a private right of action for security breaches that could lead to some form of remedy including regulatory scrutiny, fines, private right of action settlements, and other consequences. The financial exposure from the events referenced above could either not be insured against or not be fully covered through any insurance that we may maintain, and there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in any of our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages as a result of the events referenced above. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to discontinue using our products or purchasing from us altogether.\nThe failure of our equipment lease customers to pay us under leasing agreements with them that we do not sell to third party lease finance companies could harm our revenue and operating results.\nIn 2012, we began offering our solutions to our customers through multi-year equipment lease agreements. We sell the bulk of these leases, including the related accounts receivables, to third party lease finance companies on a non-recourse basis. We retain unsold leases in-house, which exposes us to the creditworthiness of such lease customers over the lease term. For the leases that we retain in-house, our ability to collect payments from a customer or to recognize revenue for the sale could be impaired if the customer fails to meet its obligations to us such as in the case of its bankruptcy filing or deterioration in its financial position, or has other creditworthiness issues, any of which could harm our revenue and operating results.\nOur use of open source and non-commercial software components could impose risks and limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions.\nOur solutions contain software modules licensed under open source and other types of non-commercial licenses, including the GNU Public License, the Apache License and others. We also may incorporate open source and other licensed software into our solutions in the future. Use and distribution of such software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as licenses of these types generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some of these licenses require the release of our proprietary source code to the public if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners. This could allow competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately result in a loss of sales for us.\nThe terms of many open source and other non-commercial licenses have not been judicially interpreted, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In such event, in order to continue offering our solutions, we could be required to seek licenses from alternative licensors, which may not be available on a commercially reasonable basis or at all, to re-engineer our solutions or to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event we cannot obtain a license or re-engineer our solutions on a timely basis, any of which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, if an owner of licensed software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the corresponding license agreement, we could incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. In the event such claims were successful, we could be subject to significant damages, be required to disclose our source code, or be enjoined from the distribution of our solutions.\nClaims of intellectual property infringement could harm our business.\nVigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies in our industry. Although claims of this kind have not materially affected our business to date, there can be no assurance of the absence of such claims in the future. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nIntellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. In addition, we currently have a limited portfolio of issued patents compared to many other industry participants, and therefore may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant products and against whom our potential patents may provide little or no deterrence.\nMany potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services. We might also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We protect our proprietary technology through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries. We also protect our proprietary technology through licensing agreements, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions. These protections may not be available in all cases or may be inadequate to prevent our competitors from copying, reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our technology, proprietary rights or solutions in an unauthorized manner. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. In addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, or applications for any of the foregoing. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, or superior, to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. In each case, our ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nTo prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management\u2019s attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than us. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property. While we plan to continue to protect our intellectual property with, among other things, patent protection, there can be no assurance that:\n\u2022current or future U.S. or foreign patent applications will be approved;\n\u2022our issued patents will protect our intellectual property and not be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged by third parties;\n\u2022we will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions in which we develop technology, or we or our competitors operate; or\n\u2022others will not independently develop similar or competing products or methods or design around any patents that may be issued to us.\nOur failure to obtain patents with claims of a scope necessary to cover our technology, or the invalidation of our patents, or our inability to protect any of our intellectual property, may weaken our competitive position and harm our business and operating results. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProduct liability or other liability claims could cause us to incur significant costs, adversely affect the sales of our solutions and harm our reputation.\nOur solutions are utilized by healthcare professionals and others in the course of providing patient care. As a result, patients, family members, physicians, nurses or others may allege we are responsible for harm to patients or healthcare professionals due to defects in, the malfunction of, the characteristics of, or the operation of, our solutions. Any such allegations could harm our reputation and ability to sell our solutions.\nOur solutions utilize lithium-ion batteries and electronic components that may overheat or otherwise malfunction as a result of physical or environmental damage. Components of our solutions emit radio frequency (RF) emissions which have been alleged, in connection with cellular phones, to have adverse health consequences. Magnets in our badges may emit electromagnetic radiation and may be alleged to interfere with implanted medical or other devices. While these components of our solutions comply with applicable guidelines, some may allege that these components of our solutions cause adverse health consequences. Also, applicable guidelines may change making these components of our solutions non-compliant. Any such allegations or non-compliance, or any regulatory developments, could negatively impact the sales of our solutions, require costly modifications to our solutions, and harm our reputation.\nAlthough our customer agreements contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our potential liability, we could be required to spend significant amounts of management time and resources to defend ourselves against product liability, tort, warranty or other claims. If any such claims were to prevail, we could be forced to pay damages, comply with injunctions or stop distributing our solutions. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our business. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions; however, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover large claims against us or otherwise continue to be available on acceptable terms. Further, the insurer could attempt to disclaim coverage as to any particular claim.\nWe may require additional capital to support our business growth, and such capital may not be available.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, which include the need to develop new solutions or enhance existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure, expand our sales and marketing capabilities, expand into non-healthcare markets, and acquire complementary businesses, technologies or assets. Accordingly, we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financing to secure funds. Equity and debt financing, however, might not be available when needed or, if available, might not be available on terms satisfactory to us. If we raise additional funds through equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us in the future, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited as we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our initiatives, which could harm our operating results.\nSome of our solutions are, and others could become, subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or similar foreign agencies, which could increase our operating costs.\nWe provide certain products that are, and others that may become, subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar agencies in other countries, or the jurisdiction of these agencies could be expanded in the future to include our solutions. The FDA regulates certain products, including software-based products, as \u201cmedical devices\u201d based, in part, on the intended use of the product and the risk the device poses to the patient should the device fail to perform properly. For example, the clinical alert notification solution we acquired as part of our acquisition of Extension Healthcare and the clinical communications product we acquired from mVisum are regulated by the FDA as Class II medical devices. Although we have concluded that our wireless badge is a general-purpose communications device not subject to FDA regulation, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion, or changes in our solutions or the FDA\u2019s evolving regulation could lead to FDA regulation of our solutions. Canada and many other countries in which we sell or may sell our solutions could also have similar regulations applicable to our solutions, some of which may be subject to change or interpretation. We may incur substantial operating costs if we are required to register our solutions or components of our solutions as regulated medical devices under U.S. or foreign regulations, obtain premarket approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, and satisfy the extensive reporting requirements. In addition, failure to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement actions and monetary penalties.\nEnvironmental and social (E&S) regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer demand, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers.\nThere is an increasing focus on the governance of environmental and social risks in our industry. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include E&S provisions that their suppliers must comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of participants in the industry are also joining voluntary E&S initiatives, such as the Responsible Business Alliance. These E&S provisions and initiatives are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our outsourced manufacturing. If we are unable to comply or are unable to cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to comply, with such policies or provisions, a customer may stop purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations.\nIn addition, as part of their E&S programs, an increasing number of customers are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflict, such as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of our equipment. Since our supply chain is complex, we are not currently able to definitively ascertain the origins of all of the minerals and metals used in our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers\u2019 demands, which may harm our sales and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Notes\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes.\nAs a result of the Notes offering, we incurred $143.75 million principal amount of indebtedness, the principal amount of which we may be required to pay at maturity in 2023. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, the indenture for the Notes provides that we are required to repay amounts due under the indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to maturity date of the Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, this indebtedness could, among other things:\n\u2022heighten our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and heightened competitive pressures;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes.\nIn addition, our ability to purchase the Notes or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts under the Notes upon an event of default or pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness outstanding at the time. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture (whether upon a fundamental change or otherwise under the indenture) or pay cash payable on future conversions of the Notes (unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion) as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing any future indebtedness. If the repayment of any related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nProvisions in the indenture for the Notes may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to you.\nIf a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indenture for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to our stockholders.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (ASC 470-20), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. We are required to record a non-cash interest expense for the amortization of this debt discount for the term of the Notes which will adversely affect our financial results while the Notes are outstanding.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we\nelected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable, or otherwise elect not to, use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the option counterparties). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. This activity could have increased (or reduced the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock or the Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes or following any repurchase of notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the price of our common stock or the Notes. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the price of our common stock or the Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nRisks related to our common stock\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and currently intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management that stockholders consider favorable and cause our stock price to decline.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or change in our management that the stockholders of our company consider favorable. These provisions:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022establish advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from cumulating their votes for the election of directors;\n\u2022permit newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors or vacancies on our board of directors to be filled only by majority vote of our remaining directors, even if less than a quorum is then in office;\n\u2022provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022provide that our directors may be removed only for \u201ccause\u201d and only with the approval of the holders of at least 66 2/3rds percent of our outstanding stock; and\n\u2022require super-majority voting to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may also discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nThe exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. In April 2020, we amended and restated our restated bylaws to provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (a Federal Forum Provision). Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal courts or other state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision generally means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court. While neither the exclusive forum provision nor the Federal Forum Provision applies to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder also must be brought in federal court. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. These provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.\nGeneral risk factors\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is often unrelated or disproportionate to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variation in anticipated operating results of us or our competitors;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new solutions, new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in the regulatory environment affecting our healthcare customers, including impediments to their ability to obtain reimbursement for their services, and other actual or anticipated legal or regulatory developments in the United States or foreign countries;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, technologies or assets by us or our competitor;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock;\n\u2022our decision to seek additional equity or debt financing;\n\u2022our public float relative to the total number of shares of our common stock that are issued and outstanding;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022the dissemination of adverse or misleading reports or opinions about our business;\n\u2022any major change in our management;\n\u2022unfavorable economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or health epidemics or contagious diseases.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions or terrorism.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity, and many critical components of our solutions are sourced in Asia and Mexico, regions known to suffer natural disasters and epidemics or contagious diseases. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, or epidemic or contagious disease, occurring at our headquarters, our other facilities or where our contract manufacturer or its suppliers are located, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business, the businesses of our customers and suppliers, or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce located worldwide, and in particular, our senior management, general and administrative, and research and development activities that are coordinated with our corporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area. Any disruption to our internal communications, whether caused by a natural disaster, an epidemic or contagious disease, or by man-made problems, such as power disruptions, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Asia or Mexico could delay our research and development efforts, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders or delay deployment of our solutions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In particular, we must obtain confidence in our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the extent we find a material weakness or other deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nMultiple negative consequences could ensue if a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is identified in the future, or we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or we do not maintain effective controls. For example, our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could be restated, we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our controls from our independent registered public accounting firm, or we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities. All of these outcomes would require additional financial and management resources, and the market price of our stock could decline.\nWe will continue to incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management devotes substantial time to public company compliance obligations.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and our stock exchange, impose various requirements on public companies, including certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations, along with compliance with accounting principles and regulatory interpretations of such principles, as amended by the JOBS Act, have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nWe face risks related to securities litigation that could result in significant legal expenses and settlement or damage awards.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future become, subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws or other related claims, which could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs. Regardless of the outcome, these matters or future litigation may require significant attention from management and could result in significant\nlegal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports about our company, we could lose visibility in the financial market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Further, securities or industry analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13316, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "VCRA"}
