{"cik": "1278021", "company": "MARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nGlobal economic, political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services, and our profitability and business could suffer.\nThe global financial services business is, by its nature, risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the U.S. and/or global financial services markets, resulting in reduced trading volume. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:\n\u00b7\neconomic and political conditions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere;\n\u00b7\nadverse market conditions, including unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading;\n\u00b7\nbroad trends in business and finance;\n\u00b7\nconsolidation or contraction in the number of broker-dealers;\n\u00b7\nactual or threatened acts of war or terrorism or other armed hostilities;\n\u00b7\nconcerns over inflation and weakening consumer confidence levels;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of cash for investment by mutual funds and other wholesale and retail investors;\n\u00b7\nthe level and volatility of interest rates, the difference between the yields on corporate securities being traded and those on related benchmark securities and foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of Federal Reserve Board monetary policy, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions, and other regulatory requirements and political impasses;\n\u00b7\ncredit availability and other liquidity concerns;\n\u00b7\nconcerns over credit default or bankruptcy of one or more sovereign nations or corporate entities; and\n\u00b7\nlegislative and regulatory changes.\nAny one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally. Our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the U.S. and global financial markets.\nDecreases in trading volumes in the fixed-income markets generally or on our platform would harm our business and profitability.\nWe have experienced significant decreases in overall trading volume in the past and may experience similar decreases in trading volume in the future. Declines in the overall volume of fixed-income securities trading and in market liquidity generally, as well as declines in interest rate volatility, could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platform and fees generated from related activities.\nLikewise, decreases in our share of the segments of the fixed-income trading markets in which we operate, or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated, could result in lower trading volume on our platform and, consequently, lower commissions and revenue. During periods of increased volatility in credit markets, the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with broker-dealers. In addition, during rapidly moving markets, broker-dealers are less likely to post prices electronically. Our market share of the fixed-income trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors, including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt, the level of bond fund inflows or outflows, the percentage of volumes comprised of Rule 144A transactions, the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as \u2018block trades\u2019 and whether the prevalent market environment is an \u201coffer wanted\u201d or \u201cbid wanted\u201d environment.\nA decline in trading volumes on our platform or our platform\u2019s market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nThe fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. We will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically. In addition, our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include:\n\u00b7\nother multi-dealer trading companies;\n\u00b7\nmarket data and information vendors;\n\u00b7\nsecurities and futures exchanges;\n\u00b7\ninter-dealer brokerage firms;\n\u00b7\nelectronic communications networks;\n\u00b7\ntechnology, software, and information services or other companies that have existing commercial relationships with broker-dealers or institutional investors; and\n\u00b7\nother electronic marketplaces that are not currently in the securities business.\nMany of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence, as well as greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. These competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into, or otherwise compete in, market segments in which we provide services, potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixed-income or equity securities or other business operations. In addition, many of our competitors offer a wider range of services, have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do. Some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities, technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities.\nAny combination of our competitors may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us. Current and new competitors can launch new platforms at a relatively low cost. Others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions. We expect that we will potentially compete with a variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer. If we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nNeither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured. Even if we do experience growth, we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably.\nThe success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and expand the network of broker-dealer and institutional investor clients that use our electronic trading platform. Our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platform by these clients. Individuals at broker-dealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests, which may discourage their use of our platform.\nOur growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base. We currently derive approximately 53% of our revenues from secondary trading in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds. Our long-term business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixed-income products and other sources. We cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability. We have experienced significant growth in trading volumes, revenues and profitability in recent years. We cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate, if at all.\nOur businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by an adverse change in the regions in which we operate.\nHistorically, our business operations have been substantially located in the U.S. and the U.K. While we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas, we are still highly concentrated in these areas. Accordingly, our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes, economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these two countries. Moreover, due to the concentration of our operations in these areas, such operations are less diversified and, accordingly, are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors. If we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe face risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies operating in rapidly evolving industries, such as the electronic financial services industry. These risks and difficulties include, but are not limited to, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nattract and retain broker-dealers and institutional investors on our platform on a cost-effective basis;\n\u00b7\nexpand and enhance reliable and cost-effective product and service offerings to our clients;\n\u00b7\nrespond effectively to the loss of any of our significant broker-dealer or institutional investor clients, including due to merger, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation or other cause (including, among other things, the collection of any amounts due from such clients);\n\u00b7\nrespond effectively to competitive pressures;\n\u00b7\ndiversify our sources of revenues;\n\u00b7\nmaintain adequate control of our expenses;\n\u00b7\noperate, support, expand and develop our operations, technology, website, software, communications and other systems;\n\u00b7\nmanage growth in personnel and operations;\n\u00b7\nincrease awareness of our brand or market positioning;\n\u00b7\nexpand our sales and marketing programs;\n\u00b7\ntake advantage of acquisitions, strategic alliances and other opportunities; and\n\u00b7\nrespond to regulatory changes or demands.\nIf we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe may enter into new fee plans, the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate; past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.\nFrom time to time, we may introduce new fee plans for the U.S. high-grade corporate bond and other market segments in which we operate. Any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives. We cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platform or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans. It is possible that our broker-dealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platform or terminating their contractual relationship with us, which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our U.S. high-grade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and, as a result, is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded. We anticipate that average U.S. high-grade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield, years-to-maturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform. Consequently, past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.\nWe are exposed to risks resulting from non-performance by counterparties to certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary.\nIn connection with our anonymous Open Trading\u2122 protocols, we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled through a third-party clearing broker. Settlement typically occurs within one to three trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded.\nWe are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing Open Trading\u2122 trades on our platform, including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk. In connection with Open Trading\u2122 or other anonymous protocols, we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase.\nIn the process of executing matched principal transactions, miscommunications and other errors by our clients can arise whereby one of the counterparties to the transaction rejects the trade or otherwise refuses to settle their side of the transaction on the terms recorded by our platform. These unsettled or rejected trades can create a potential liability for our subsidiary involved in the trade. If an error is promptly discovered and alleged by a client and there is a prompt cancellation of the trade or disposition of any resultant position held by us or the other party to the trade, the risk to us is usually limited. If the discovery of an error by a client is delayed, the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening movements in the price of the applicable security prior to disposition. Although errors usually become known at the time of, or later on the day of, the trade, it is possible that they may not be discovered until later in the settlement process. If we are required to hold a position as a result of an error or a failure to deliver is prolonged, there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us. Depending on the cause, number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute, such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have policies and procedures in place to identify and manage our credit risk. In connection with the recent growth of our Open Trading\u2122 protocols, we have implemented additional automated controls to help us manage our credit risk exposure. There can be no assurance that the policies, procedures and automated controls we use to manage this credit risk will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure. Some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed- income markets, our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources. Such information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly assessed and interpreted by us. If our risk management procedures fail, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks.\nWe are dependent on our broker-dealer clients, who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or third-party platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients.\nWe rely on our broker-dealer clients to provide product and liquidity on our electronic trading platform by posting bond prices on our platform for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries. The contractual obligations of our broker-dealer clients to us are minimal, non-exclusive and terminable by such clients. Our broker-dealer clients buy and sell fixed-income securities through traditional methods, including by telephone and e-mail messaging, and through other electronic trading platforms. Some of our broker-dealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks, and many of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures, including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels, as trading participants and/or as investors. These competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such broker-dealers\u2019 primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors.\nIn the U.S., the Volcker Rule section of the Dodd-Frank Act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates, which could adversely affect our bank-affiliated broker-dealer clients\u2019 ability to make markets in a variety of fixed-income securities. If bank-affiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants, the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries over the past several years. Moreover, several of our large broker-dealer clients have announced plans to reduce their sales and trading businesses in fixed-income. Further consolidation, instability, and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition, which may lower volumes.\nAny reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our broker-dealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform, which could, in turn, reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients.\nWe rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platform. A limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume. One institutional investor client accounted for approximately 15.3%, 14.0%, and 12.5% of trading volumes during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, investment funds managed by this institutional investor client beneficially owned approximately 8.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, primarily through passive index and ETF funds.\nThe obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal, non-exclusive and terminable by such clients. Our institutional investor clients buy and sell fixed-income securities through traditional methods, including by telephone and e-mail messaging, and through other electronic trading platforms.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform. The loss of any major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results or fail to meet revenue and earnings expectations, our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe unpredictability of the financial services industry;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in quickly adjusting our expense base if revenues fall short of expectations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain existing broker-dealer and institutional investor clients and attract new broker-dealer and institutional investor clients;\n\u00b7\nour ability to drive an increase in use of our electronic trading platform by new and existing broker-dealer and institutional investor clients;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new features on our electronic trading platform;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our sales force;\n\u00b7\nnew product and service introductions by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in overall market trading volume or our market share for our key products;\n\u00b7\ntechnical difficulties or interruptions in our service;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions in our geographic markets;\n\u00b7\nadditional investment in our services or operations; and\n\u00b7\nnew regulations that limit or affect how our electronic trading platform can operate or which increase our regulatory compliance costs.\nAs a result, our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, which could result in decreases in our stock price.\nWe may not be able to introduce enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform, new services and/or service enhancements in a timely or acceptable manner, which could harm our competitive position.\nOur business environment is characterized by rapid technological change, changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands and evolving industry standards. Our future will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new features to, and new versions of, our electronic trading platform. The success of new features and versions depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or version. In addition, the market for our electronic trading platform may be limited if prospective clients require customized features or functions that we are unable or unwilling to provide. For example, we have responded to the reduction in fixed-income secondary market liquidity that has been experienced since the credit crisis by, among other things, introducing a number of all-to-all trading options for our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. However, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services, products and technologies and develop new features and enhanced versions of our electronic trading platform that achieve widespread levels of market acceptance on a timely and cost-effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we enter new markets, we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets.\nOur strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platform to enter new markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in other markets. Even if we do adapt our software and technology, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients and compete successfully in any such new markets. We cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities, including among other things, our proposed entrance into the municipal bond market, will be successful. If these efforts are not successful, we may realize less than expected earnings, which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock. Furthermore, these efforts may divert management attention or inefficiently utilize our resources.\nRapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients.\nWe must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform. The electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes, increasingly complex systems and infrastructures, changes in clients\u2019 needs and preferences and new business models. If new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us, our existing technology, systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed. Our future success will depend on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nenhance our existing products and services;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to attract highly-skilled technology personnel; and\n\u00b7\nrespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nDeveloping our electronic trading platform and other technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platform, information databases and network infrastructure to broker-dealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements, our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our products and use those of our competitors.\nFurther, the adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transaction-processing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards. We cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for key products and services.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading, information and other systems, as well as computers and other equipment, and related support and maintenance. We cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner, if at all, or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. If we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn particular, we depend on third-party vendors for our corporate bond reference database and the clearing and settlement of our Open Trading\u2122 transactions. Disruptions in the services provided by those third-parties to us, including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide services that are critical to the success of our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also rely, and expect in the future to continue to rely, on third parties for various computer and communications systems, such as telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors. Other third parties provide, for instance, our data center, telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing, support and maintenance services. Any interruption in these or other third-party services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service. We cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely.\nWe license software from third parties, much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business. We also hire contractors to assist in the development, quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems. Continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations. Adverse changes in any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe attempt to negotiate favorable pricing, service, confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our third-party service providers. These contracts usually have multi-year terms. However, there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms. Further, the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology.\nOur success depends on maintaining the integrity of our electronic trading platform, systems and infrastructure; our computer systems may suffer failures, capacity constraints and business interruptions that could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose clients.\nIn order to be successful, we must provide reliable, secure, real-time access to our electronic trading platform for our clients. If our electronic trading platform is hampered by slow delivery times, unreliable service or insufficient capacity, our clients may decide to stop using our platform, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs our operations grow in both size and scope, we will need to improve and upgrade our electronic trading platform and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume, the trading practices of new and existing clients, regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features, functionalities and ancillary products and services. The expansion of our electronic trading platform and infrastructure has required, and will continue to require, substantial financial, operational and technical resources. These resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages. We cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance. Furthermore, we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems, and the development of these new technologies also entails technical, financial and business risks. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platform, technology and systems to the requirements of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards. The inability of our electronic trading platform to accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business.\nWe cannot assure you that we, or our third-party service providers, will not experience systems failures. Our electronic trading platform, computer and communication systems and other operations are vulnerable to damage, interruption or failure as a result of, among other things:\n\u00b7\nirregular or heavy use of our electronic trading platform during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility;\n\u00b7\npower, internet or telecommunications failures, hardware failures or software errors;\n\u00b7\nhuman error;\n\u00b7\ncomputer viruses, acts of vandalism or sabotage (and resulting potential lapses in security), both internal and external;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, fires, floods, widespread health emergencies or other acts of God;\n\u00b7\nacts of war or terrorism (including cyberterrorism) or other armed hostility;\n\u00b7\ncybersecurity breaches; and\n\u00b7\nloss of support services from third parties, including those to whom we outsource aspects of our computer infrastructure critical to our business.\nIn the event that any of our systems, or those of our third-party providers, fail or operate slowly, it may cause any one or more of the following to occur:\n\u00b7\nunanticipated disruptions in service to our clients;\n\u00b7\ndistribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to customers who rely on this data for their trades;\n\u00b7\nslower response times or delays in our clients\u2019 trade execution;\n\u00b7\nincomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades;\n\u00b7\nfinancial losses and liabilities to clients;\n\u00b7\nlitigation or other claims against us, including formal complaints to industry regulatory organizations; and\n\u00b7\nregulatory inquiries, proceedings or sanctions.\nAny system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of our service, including failures caused by client error or misuse of our systems, could damage our reputation, business and brand name and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our electronic trading platform.\nIn these circumstances, if we were unable to execute our disaster recovery plans, or our redundant systems and disaster recovery plans proved insufficient for the particular situation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, although many of our contracts with our service providers require them to have disaster recovery plans, we cannot be certain that these will be\nadequate or implemented properly. In addition, our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur.\nIt is also a risk that we will not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all such system problems. Our disaster recovery plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology, so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation.\nWe internally support and maintain many of our computer systems and networks, including those underlying our electronic trading platform. Our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or, if necessary, to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and cost-effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our electronic trading platform, our business could suffer a material adverse effect.\nOur electronic trading platform involves the processing, storage and transmission of a very large number of transactions and data (including confidential client information). The secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations. Cyber attacks on our systems could expose us to a risk of misappropriation of this information, leading to litigation, reputational harm and possible liability. Despite the defensive measures we have taken, these threats may come from external factors such as governments, organized crime, hackers, and other third parties such as outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential information, our reputation could be damaged, our business would suffer and we could incur material liability. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints of any of the third party service providers that facilitate our business activities, including clients, clearing agents or data providers. Such parties could also be the source of a cyber attack on or breach of our operational systems, data or infrastructure.\nThere have been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents in recent years in various industries, including ours. Any such cyber incident involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A cyber attack or security breach on our system or that of a third-party service provider could manifest in different ways and could lead to any number of harmful consequences, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nmisappropriation of financial assets, intellectual property or sensitive information belonging to us, our clients or our third-party service providers;\n\u00b7\ncorruption of data or causing operational disruption through computer viruses or phishing; and\n\u00b7\ndenial of service attacks to prevent users from accessing our platform.\nOur remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack. If an actual, threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platform. We may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage, protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, loss of clients and revenues and litigation, caused by any breaches. We may be found liable to our clients for any stolen assets or misappropriated confidential information. Although we intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively, which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platform. This could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nIntellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete, and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, third-party non-disclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees, consultants, advisors and\ncollaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information. We have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology and/or business, but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued. Additionally, laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties. For instance, a third party might reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our permission and without our knowledge, thereby infringing our rights and allowing competitors to duplicate or replicate our products. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.\nWe may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights, but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive, and the outcome would not be certain. In addition, the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nDefending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business. If we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, we could be required to redesign our products, pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties.\nIn the technology industry, there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases, the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows. Although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute, we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights. From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business, the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could:\n\u00b7\nbe expensive and time-consuming to defend;\n\u00b7\nprevent us from operating our business, or portions of our business;\n\u00b7\ncause us to cease developing, licensing or using all or any part of our electronic trading platform that incorporates the challenged intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to redesign our products or services, which may not be feasible;\n\u00b7\nresult in significant monetary liability;\n\u00b7\ndivert management\u2019s attention and resources; and\n\u00b7\nrequire us to pay royalties or enter into licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to our electronic trading platform or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products, try to redesign our products or services, enter into royalty arrangements, if available, or engage in litigation that could be costly to us. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we acquire or invest in other businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to integrate them with our business, our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire or invest in companies, products or technologies that we believe are strategic. We may not be able to identify, negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully. Even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business, product or technology, such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may find that the acquired company or assets do not further our business strategy, or that we overpaid for the company or assets, or the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision may change;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing electronic trading platform, products and services;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, or retaining the key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nthere may be client confusion if our services overlap with those of the acquired company and we may have difficulty retaining key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nour ongoing business and management\u2019s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises;\n\u00b7\nentry into markets in which we have limited experience and where competitors hold stronger market positions;\n\u00b7\npotential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or product; and\n\u00b7\nexposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time. From time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated. Such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as out-of-pocket costs.\nThe consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options or other rights, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, large one-time write-offs, such as of acquired in-process research and development costs, and restructuring charges.\nOur investments in expanding our information and post-trade services businesses may not produce substantial revenue or profit.\nWith respect to our information and post-trade services businesses, we may incur substantial development, sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service. Even after incurring these costs, we ultimately may not sell any or sell only small amounts of these products or services. Consequently, if revenue does not increase in a timely fashion as a result of these expansion and development initiatives, the up-front costs associated with them may exceed the related revenue and reduce our working capital and income.\nWe may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. We test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis, at year-end, or more frequently if there are changed circumstances. We assess intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment.\nDetermining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and requires management to use significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates and asset lives. Any future acquisition may result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges.\nWe are dependent on our management team, and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Richard M. McVey, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. The terms of Mr. McVey\u2019s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time, subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of non-vested equity compensation awards. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel. Any loss or interruption of Mr. McVey\u2019s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason, as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption, could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively and/or pursue our business strategy.\nBecause competition for our employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business.\nWe strive to provide high-quality services that will allow us to establish and maintain long-term relationships with our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients. Our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships, as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally, depends in large part upon our employees. We must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services, hardware engineers, technicians, product managers and senior sales executives.\nThe market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of credit products. Many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff. Additionally, highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel. Many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet, high-technology and financial services industries, job candidates often consider the total compensation package offered, including the value of the stock-based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment. Significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. The expensing of stock-based compensation may also discourage us from granting the size or type of stock-based compensation that job candidates may require to join our company or that is required to retain existing employees. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel. The failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations.\nOur business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations. These regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders. The SEC, FINRA, the CFTC and other agencies extensively regulate the United States financial services industry, including most of our operations in the United States. Much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions, including regulations overseen by the FCA in the United Kingdom, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada and provincial regulators in Canada, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Central Bank in Brazil, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority in Switzerland. In addition, Xtrakter is registered as an ARM with the FCA and has \u201crecognized status\u201d in France, the Netherlands and Belgium in connection with the submission of transaction reports to regulators.\nAs a matter of public policy, these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets. These regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret, investigate and sanction non-compliance with their laws, rules and regulations.\nMost aspects of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are highly regulated, including:\n\u00b7\nthe way we deal with our clients;\n\u00b7\nour capital requirements;\n\u00b7\nour financial and regulatory reporting practices;\n\u00b7\nrequired record-keeping and record retention procedures;\n\u00b7\nthe licensing of our employees; and\n\u00b7\nthe conduct of our directors, officers, employees and affiliates.\nWe cannot assure you that we and/or our directors, officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws, rules and regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of our business, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our membership in FINRA and registration as a broker-dealer.\nMarketAxess Corporation and MarketAxess Europe Limited are subject to U.S. and U.K. regulations as a registered broker-dealer and as a MTF, respectively, which prohibit repayment of borrowings from the Company or affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to the Company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources, without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary\u2019s principal regulator. MarketAxess SEF Corporation is registered with the CFTC as a SEF and is required, among other things, to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year.\nOur authority to operate as a broker-dealer in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization. Our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance, credit approval, audit and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, credit approval, audit and risk management personnel. Our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations. In addition, the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems, procedures and personnel and has resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems.\nIn addition, because our industry is heavily regulated, regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Even if approvals are obtained, they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical. For a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities, see \u201cItem 1 - Business-Government Regulation.\u201d\nSome of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership. These regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary, which may include changes in control of MarketAxess. As a result of these regulations, our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body.\nOur business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation, which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business.\nThe financial services industry, in general, is heavily regulated. Proposals for legislation further regulating the financial services industry are continually being introduced in the United States Congress, in state legislatures and by foreign governments. The government agencies that regulate us continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives, may adopt new or revised laws and regulations and have broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish noncompliance with their rules, regulations and industry standards of practice. In light of recent conditions in the global financial markets and economy, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. We are unable to predict which of these proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and that of our clients are also affected by the policies adopted by the Federal Reserve and international central banking authorities, which may affect the credit quality of our customers or increase the cost for our customers to trade the instruments on our platform. In addition, such changes in monetary policy may directly impact our cost of funds for capital raising and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and are difficult to predict.\nIn addition, following the global financial crisis and other recent events in the financial industry, governments and regulators in both the United States and Europe have called for increased regulation and transparency in the OTC markets. As a result, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in 2010. Among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the Dodd-Frank Act are mandatory clearing of swaps through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or SEFs, in each case, subject to certain key exceptions. MarketAxess SEF Corporation is registered with the CFTC as a SEF for certain credit derivatives. No assurance can be given regarding when, whether or in what form the remaining rules regarding the new regulatory regime for the swaps marketplace, including the SEC\u2019s rules that will govern the execution of single-name credit derivatives, will be finalized or implemented or whether we will be able to operate a SEF or security-based SEF that can successfully compete for the credit derivative execution business of our clients. In addition, we have incurred significant costs to comply with the new regulatory requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and we cannot assure you that the additional costs associated with the registration and operation of a SEF or security-based SEF will not exceed our expected revenues or that our financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected.\nSimilar to the U.S., regulatory bodies in Europe are developing new rules for the fixed-income markets. MiFID II and MiFIR were approved in June 2014 and introduce changes in market structure designed to: (i) enhance pre- and post-trade transparency for fixed income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity, (ii) increase and enhance post-trade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit post-trade data to ARMs, (iii) ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and (iv) establish a consolidated tape for trade data. While some of the rules and technical advice underpinning MiFID II have not yet been finalized, MiFID II will have a significant impact in these areas, as well as on corporate governance and investor protection. MiFID II and MiFIR are expected to take effect in January 2018. The final rules may have an adverse effect on our\noperations or our ability to provide our electronic trading platform in a manner that can successfully compete against other types of regulated and non-regulated venues for the fixed-income trading needs of our clients. In addition, MiFID II is expected to cause us to expend more significant compliance, business and technology resources, incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure for our trading and post-trade businesses. We cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes will impact our European business and operations, but they may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, which could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development and growth of impacted markets to become impractical. For example, the Volcker Rule section of the Dodd-Frank Act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates, which could adversely affect our bank-affiliated broker-dealer clients\u2019 ability to make markets in a variety of fixed-income securities, thereby negatively impacting the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform. Other regulatory initiatives include Basel III, a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and liquidity in most of the world\u2019s major economies by 2019. The implementation of these rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to raise additional capital and liquidity. As a result, their businesses could be adversely affected, which might cause them to trade less on our platform. In addition, as we expand our business into new markets, it is likely that we will be subject to additional laws, rules and regulations. We cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur disclosed trading system has not been subjected to regulation as an alternative trading system under Regulation ATS. A determination by the SEC to treat our trading platform as an alternative trading system subject to Regulation ATS would subject us to additional reporting obligations and other limitations on the conduct of our business, many of which could be material. Currently, our central limit order book trading service for single-name credit derivatives and our Mid-X matching service for corporate bonds are regulated as alternative trading systems subject to Regulation ATS.\nThe activities and consequences described above may result in significant distractions to our management and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future.\nWe operate an electronic trading platform in Europe and may further expand our operations throughout Europe, Asia and other regions. We have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platform and services. However, there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the financial services industry, which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nless developed technological infrastructures and generally higher costs, which could result in lower client acceptance of our services or clients having difficulty accessing our trading platform;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals for planned expansion, if at all, and the possibility that any approvals that are obtained may impose restrictions on the operation of our business;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to manage and coordinate the various regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving and subject to unexpected change;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nreduced or no protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nseasonal reductions in business activity; and\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nOur international operations are also subject to the legal, economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world, including but not limited to the risk of war, inter and intra national conflict, economic crises and terrorism.\nIn addition, we must comply with the laws, regulations and registration rules of the FCA in the U.K. and foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business. For example, regulatory bodies in Europe have approved the final texts of MiFID II and MiFIR, which are expected to take effect in January 2018. We cannot predict the extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our European business and operations, but they may cause us to\nexpend more significant compliance, business and technology resources, incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure.\nWe cannot predict what future actions the U.S., U.K. and other regulatory bodies might take, or the impact that any such actions may have on our business. Our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients\u2019 trading activities on our platform.\nFurther, we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors, established local markets, and economic and political instability. Our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExtensive regulation of our businesses results in ongoing exposure to potential significant costs and penalties.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations, inspections, and investigations, which may result in costs, penalties, fines, enhanced oversight, additional requirements, restrictions, or limitations, and censure, suspension, or expulsion. Self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA and the National Futures Association (\u201cNFA\u201d), along with statutory bodies such as the SEC, the CFTC, and the FCA, and other international regulators, require strict compliance with their rules and regulations.\nFirms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years, and penalties, fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the NFA, state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the U.S., and the FCA in the U.K. and other international regulators, have increased accordingly. This trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and this environment may create uncertainty. Accordingly, we face the risk of regulatory intervention, investigations and proceedings, any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability. Any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nWe cannot assure you that our compliance and risk management methods will be effective and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if they fail.\nTo manage the risks inherent in our business, we must maintain effective policies, procedures and systems that enable us to identify, monitor and control our exposure to financial, legal, regulatory, operational and market risks. Our risk-management methods are based on internally developed controls, observed historical market behavior and what we believe to be industry practices. Our risk-management methods may prove to be ineffective because of their design, their implementation or the lack of adequate, accurate or timely information. Our risk management methods may also fail to identify a risk or understand a risk that might result in losses. If our risk-management policies and efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe must rely upon our analysis of information regarding markets, personnel, clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. That information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly analyzed. Furthermore, we rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and potential failure, the challenges of which are exacerbated by the 24-hour-a-day, global nature of our business.\nOur success in complying with complex and changing laws and navigating risks in various jurisdictions and markets depends on our maintenance of compliance, auditing and reporting systems and risk management procedures, as well as our ability to recruit and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel. While we have developed policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our legal, regulatory, operational and market risks, we cannot assure you that our systems will always be effective in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are exposed.\nOur growth initiatives may place significant strain on management and other resources.\nWe have significantly expanded our business activities and operations over the last several years. Continued growth, both domestic and international, will require further investment in management and new personnel, infrastructure and compliance systems. The expansion of our international operations involves risks that may have an adverse effect on our business and operations, such as the challenge of effectively managing and staffing our international operations, complying with increased and varied regulatory requirements and entering new markets. In addition, we may incur substantial development, sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort to create a new product or service, and the period before the product or service is successfully\ndeveloped, introduced and adopted may extend over many months or years. Even after incurring these costs, our clients may determine that they do not need or prefer the product or service.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth efficiently, which could result in our expansion costs increasing at a faster rate than our revenues and distracting management from our core business and operations. If we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage new initiatives, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nIn the event of employee error or misconduct, our business may be harmed.\nEmployee misconduct or error could expose us to significant liability, financial losses, regulatory sanctions and reputational harm. Misconduct or error by employees could include engaging in improperly using our confidential information or the confidential information of our clients or engaging in improper or unauthorized activities or transactions.\nOver the past few years, there have been several high-profile cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees of financial services firms. Our employees could carry out improper activities on behalf of our clients, or use proprietary client or company information for personal or other improper or illegal uses. Employee errors also expose us to the risk of material loss until such errors are detected and unauthorized transactions or improper activities are reversed.\nErrors and misconduct by our current or former employees could cause us to suffer financial losses, regulatory sanctions and reputational harm. The precautions we take to monitor and prevent employee errors and misconduct may not be effective in all cases.\nWe cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it.\nOur business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements. Although we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, we may in the future need to raise additional funds to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nsupport more rapid growth of our business;\n\u00b7\ndevelop new or enhanced services and products;\n\u00b7\nfund operating losses;\n\u00b7\nrespond to competitive pressures;\n\u00b7\nacquire complementary companies or technologies;\n\u00b7\nenter into strategic alliances;\n\u00b7\nincrease the regulatory net capital necessary to support our operations; or\n\u00b7\nrespond to unanticipated or changing capital requirements.\nThe growth of our Open Trading\u2122 protocols, in particular, is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business. In addition, our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties, other third parties or us.\nAll or part of any debt financing would likely be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase & Co., which includes restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business. For a detailed discussion of the risks associated with our credit agreement, see the Risk Factor captioned \u201cOur credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility, and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions.\u201d\nIn the future, we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us, our ability to fund our expansion, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our services or products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. These limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility, and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions.\nWe are party to a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase & Co. that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $100.0 million. Subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional $50.0 million. Our credit agreement contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take certain actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interests. These covenants restrict or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u00b7\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u00b7\nchange our line of business;\n\u00b7\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase our equity or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nconsummate a merger or consolidation;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain swap, derivative or similar transactions;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nincur restrictions on our ability to grant liens or, in the case of subsidiaries, pay dividends or other distributions.\nWe are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA level. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. If any such event of default occurs, the lender under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable, and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement. The lender would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments it has to provide further credit extensions. We may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement.\nWe are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability.\nMany aspects of our business, and the businesses of our clients, involve substantial risks of liability. Dissatisfied clients may make claims regarding quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers. We and our clients may become subject to these claims as the result of delays, failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and services provided by us. We could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even those without merit. An adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the use of electronic trading platforms does not increase, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives.\nThe success of our business plan depends in part on our ability to create an electronic trading platform for a wide range of fixed-income products and trade sizes. Historically, fixed-income securities markets operated through telephone communications between institutional investors and broker-dealers. The utilization of our products and services depends on the acceptance, adoption and growth of electronic means of trading a variety of fixed-income securities, including for larger size trades. We cannot assure you that the growth and acceptance of electronic means of trading securities will continue.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe conduct operations in several different countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., and substantial portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Accordingly, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.\nAlthough we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure to variability in certain foreign currency cash flows and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of inaccurate forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. Accordingly, if there are adverse movements in exchange rates, we may suffer significant losses, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a public company, we are subject to certain financial and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy and may divert management\u2019s attention from our business.\nWe are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) and the related SEC rules and regulations that call for our management to conduct an annual assessment and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm must also issue an annual report addressing the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting.\nWhile our internal controls over financial reporting currently meet the standards set forth in SOX, failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be certain of our ability to continue to comply with the requirements of SOX. If we are unable to continue to comply with the requirements of SOX in an efficient manner, we may be subject to regulatory action. In addition, in the event that we identify a material weakness, there can be no assurance that we would be able to remediate such material weakness in an efficient manner. Moreover, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period (or if our auditors are unable to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could suffer reputational harm and incur significant expenses to restructure our internal controls over financial reporting, which may have a material adverse effect on us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nMarket volatility and future sales of our shares by significant stockholders may cause our stock price and the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by volatility in the markets in general. The market price of our common stock likely will continue to fluctuate in response to factors including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;\n\u00b7\nprevailing interest rates;\n\u00b7\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u00b7\nadditional issuances of common stock;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nour financial condition, performance and prospects, including our ability or inability to meet analyst expectations.\nMost of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, the stock markets in general, including the NASDAQ Global Select Market, have experienced and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities for companies such as ours that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may affect adversely the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance.\nIn addition, future sales of our common stock, or the perception of potential future sales, may adversely impact the market price of our common stock. If any one or more of our existing stockholders were to sell a large number of shares, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. Also, if we issue a large number of shares of our common stock in connection with a public offering, future acquisition, strategic alliance, third-party investment and private placement or otherwise, the market price of our common stock could decline considerably. Furthermore, our stockholders may be diluted by such future sales.\nWe may decrease or cease paying dividends on our common stock in the future.\nWe initiated a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock in 2009. However, there is no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividends to holders of our common stock in the future or, if we continue paying dividends, that such dividends will be paid at the rate at which they were paid in prior periods. If we were to decrease the dividend rate or cease paying dividends, investors would need to rely on the sale of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the primary or only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. These analysts work independently of us. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price could decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management, and therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management, including provisions that:\n\u00b7\nprevent stockholders from calling special meetings;\n\u00b7\nallow the directors to amend the bylaws without stockholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nset forth advance notice procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nProvisions of Delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations. In addition, we have a severance agreement with one employee and a change of control severance plan that could require an acquirer to pay a higher price. Either collectively or individually, these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers, including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions.", "PERMNO": 90454, "SIC": 6200, "TIC": "MKTX"}
