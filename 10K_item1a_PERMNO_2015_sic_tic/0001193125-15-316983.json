RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS\nWe do not know if or when we will achieve profitable operations from product sales, royalties and net profits participations and we may need additional capital to fund our operations, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and at June 30, 2015, we had a total accumulated deficit of $270.7 million. During the past three fiscal years, we financed our operations from license fees, milestone payments, research and development funding and royalty income from our collaboration partners and sales of equity securities. We do not have any assured sources of revenue, and we expect negative cash flows from operations in subsequent quarters until we receive sufficient revenues from commercialization of ILUVIEN or one or more of our other product candidates achieve regulatory approval and provide us sufficient revenues. We believe that our capital resources of $28.5 million at June 30, 2015 should enable us to fund our operations as currently planned (including our Medidur clinical trials) into early calendar year 2017. This estimate excludes any potential net profits receipts from sales of ILUVIEN. We expect that our ability to fund our planned operations beyond then will depend on the amount and timing of those payments, as well as proceeds from any future collaboration or other agreements and/or financing transactions.\nWhether we will require, or desire, to raise additional capital will be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nwhether, when and to what extent we receive revenues with respect to the commercialization of ILUVIEN;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of development, approval and marketing of Medidur for posterior uveitis;\n\u2022\nwhether and to what extent we internally fund, whether and when we initiate, and how we conduct other product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe amount of Retisert royalties and other payments we receive under collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nwhether and when we initiate Phase II clinical trials for the Latanoprost Product and whether and when Pfizer exercises its option;\n\u2022\nwhether and when we are able to enter into strategic arrangements for our product candidates and the nature of those arrangements;\n\u2022\ntimely and successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating plan, resulting in increases or decreases in our need for capital; and\n\u2022\nour views on the availability, timing and desirability of raising capital.\nIf we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital in the future, we do not know if it will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. We have an at-the-market (ATM) facility, but we do not know whether and to what extent we will seek to sell shares pursuant to that program and, if we are able to do so, on what terms. The state of the economy and the financial and credit markets at the time or times we seek any additional financing may make it more difficult or more expensive to obtain. If available, additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and potential dilutive equity, and funding through collaboration agreements may be on unfavorable terms, including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products.\nIf the recorded value of our intangible assets under GAAP is further impaired, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nAt June 30, 2015, we had $1.9 million of intangible assets relating to our Durasert and BioSilicon (including Tethadur) technologies on our balance sheet following impairment charges of $14.8 million as of December 31, 2011. We conduct impairment analyses of our intangible assets as required under GAAP and could take additional impairment charges in the future if the recorded values for our intangible assets were to exceed our assessment of the recoverability of the fair market value of those assets. Adverse events relating to these technologies, including the clinical development, regulatory approval and success of commercialization of products using them, and significant changes in our market capitalization could result in impairment charges. Further impairment charges on our intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the quarter of the impairment.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and may continue to do so in the future due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to our products and product candidates, including pre-clinical and clinical trial results, regulatory developments and marketing and sales results;\n\u2022\ntiming, receipt and amount of revenues, including receipt and recognition of collaborative research and development, milestone, royalty, net profits participation and other payments;\n\u2022\nannouncement, execution, amendment and termination of collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nscope, duration and success of collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\ncosts of internally funded research and development, including pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific adverse economic conditions that may affect, among other things, our and our collaborators\u2019 operations and financial results; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting estimates, policies or principles and intangible asset impairments.\nDue to fluctuations in our operating results, quarterly comparisons of our financial results may not necessarily be meaningful, and investors should not rely upon such results as an indication of future performance. In addition, investors may react adversely if our reported operating results are less favorable than in a prior period or are less favorable than those anticipated by investors in the financial community, which may result in decreases in our stock price.\nThere is no assurance our Retisert royalty income will continue at current levels or at all.\nRetisert royalty income, which totaled between $1.3 million and $1.4 million in each of the fiscal 2012, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014, declined to $1.2 million in fiscal 2015. We do not expect Retisert royalty income to grow materially, if at all, and it may continue to decline. There is no assurance that Bausch & Lomb will continue to market Retisert, which received marketing approval in 2005, and accordingly that we will continue to receive royalties from the sale of Retisert. Bausch & Lomb no longer markets Vitrasert.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nThere is no assurance that Alimera will successfully commercialize ILUVIEN for DME or that we will receive any significant revenues from its commercialization. If Alimera does not successfully commercialize ILUVIEN for DME, it would adversely affect our future results of operations and financial position.\nOur future financial results depend heavily on Alimera\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize ILUVIEN for DME. We do not know if, when, or to what extent we will receive future revenues from the commercialization of\nILUVIEN for DME. We are entitled to a net profit participation on a country-by-country and quarter-by-quarter basis on sales of ILUVIEN where Alimera markets ILUVIEN directly and to a percentage of royalties and non-royalty consideration where Alimera sublicenses the marketing of ILUVIEN. The amount and timing of any revenues we receive will be affected, among other things, by the manner in which Alimera markets ILUVIEN, the amounts and timing of sales of ILUVIEN, commercialization costs incurred by Alimera\u2019s direct marketing efforts, and the terms of sublicense agreements.\nThe commercialization of ILUVIEN is a significant undertaking by Alimera, and ILUVIEN for DME is its first and only product. While Alimera believes that it has sufficient funds available to fund its operations for the continued commercialization of ILUVIEN in the U.S., Germany, Portugal and the United Kingdom, Alimera has reported that its negative cash flows from operations and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Alimera may seek to raise additional financing to fund its working capital needs for the commercialization of ILUVIEN. We do not know whether Alimera will be successful in generating adequate cash flows, obtaining adequate capital or achieving additional marketing approvals for, obtaining adequate pricing and reimbursement for, successfully commercializing and achieving market acceptance of, and generating revenues to pSivida from, ILUVIEN for DME. Commercialization by Alimera in the U.S., Germany, Portugal and the U.K, including the transitioning from an outside provider of sales and marketing services in the U.K. and Germany and the provision of extended payment terms in the U.S., has required a significant expansion of Alimera\u2019s commercial infrastructure and significant financial investments. Delays in the commercial launch in other EU countries where ILUVIEN has received marketing authorization could result in withdrawal of marketing or regulatory authorization for ILUVIEN in one or more of those jurisdictions. Alimera\u2019s efforts to commercialize ILUVIEN successfully will be affected, among other things, by:\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and to raise adequate capital when and as needed;\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s ability to recruit, manage and retain personnel, expand its sales, marketing and other infrastructure, and manage its growth;\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s ability to effectively market ILUVIEN, including accessing and persuading adequate numbers of ophthalmologists to prescribe ILUVIEN;\n\u2022\nthe lack of other products to be offered by Alimera\u2019s sales personnel, which may put Alimera at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory approvals and appropriate labeling to market ILUVIEN in other jurisdictions, and to timely expand its marketing into countries where it has previously obtained and may in the future obtain approvals;\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s ability to obtain desirable pricing, insurance coverage and reimbursement for ILUVIEN;\n\u2022\npotential delays in the commercial launch in one or more countries;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing or supply issues;\n\u2022\nrisks related to operating in international jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s ability to generate adequate financial resources.\nIf Alimera is not successful in commercializing ILUVIEN for DME and generating payments to us, it would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of ILUVIEN for DME may be materially adversely affected by pricing and reimbursement decisions of regulatory bodies, insurers and others.\nPrices, coverage and reimbursement to consumers of ILUVIEN for DME, like other drugs, are generally regulated by third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities and plans, private health\ninsurers and other organizations and affect ILUVIEN\u2019s sales. The timing and complexity of those reimbursements also affect sales. Prices in the EU are generally lower and coverage and access to drugs more limited than in the U.S. For example, in the U.K. and Scotland, National Health Service coverage is limited to the treatment of the eyes of chronic DME patients unresponsive to existing therapies that have undergone cataract surgery, subject to simple patient access schemes. Alimera may not achieve satisfactory agreements with statutory or other insurers. We do not know what levels of pricing will be approved or reimbursed for ILUVIEN, or what restrictions will be placed on its use or reuse in countries where ILUVIEN is not currently sold. In the U.S., Alimera has offered extended customer payment terms. Future sales of ILUVIEN and, accordingly, our net profits share, may be adversely affected by pricing and reimbursement decisions, and such effects may be material.\nThe micro-insert for ILUVIEN and Medidur delivers FAc, a corticosteroid that has certain adverse side effects in the eye, which may affect the success of this micro-insert for treatment of DME and posterior uveitis.\nThe micro-insert for both ILUVIEN and Medidur delivers the non-proprietary corticosteroid FAc, which is associated with cataract formation and elevated IOP and may increase the risk of glaucoma and related surgery to manage those side effects. Although Retisert, which also delivers FAc to treat posterior uveitis, and ILUVIEN for DME have both been approved by the FDA, there is no assurance that Medidur will be determined to be safe for the treatment of posterior uveitis in light of its expected side effects from FAc. These side effects may limit the population for which marketing authorization is granted or for which reimbursement is provided in one or more jurisdictions and/or adversely affect sales of Medidur, if approved, and/or ILUVIEN.\nThere is no assurance that Medidur will be found to be safe and effective for the treatment of posterior uveitis.\nWhile we are optimistic that the Phase III trials for Medidur will show it to be as efficacious as Retisert was shown to be in treating posterior uveitis, but with IOP safety results that could be even better than those shown in the ILUVIEN and Retisert Phase III trials, this is only a hypothesis, and there is no assurance that the ongoing Medidur Phase III clinical trials will demonstrate these results. Data from our ongoing IOP assessment from the Medidur Phase III trials and top-line results from the Medidur investigator-sponsored study may not accurately predict the results of our Medidur Phase III program. There is no assurance that the Phase III program for Medidur will provide the necessary evidence of safety and efficacy required to file an NDA or for approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities if an NDA is filed. Approvals of Retisert and ILUVIEN by the FDA and other regulatory authorities are not predictive of actions they may take with respect to Medidur.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to file an NDA for Medidur as early as the first half of 2017, or that, if filed, the FDA will accept the NDA for review.\nFiling an NDA for Medidur will require positive results from our two Phase III trials. Based on our most recent meeting with the FDA, we plan to seek approval of Medidur based on 12-month data from our first Phase III trial, six-month data from our second Phase III trial and data from a short-duration utilization study of our redesigned proprietary inserter, together with data referenced from the Phase III trials of ILUVIEN for DME. We will be filing an amendment with the Indian regulatory authority requesting to change the primary endpoint in the protocol of our second Phase III trial in India from twelve to six months consistent with the primary endpoint for filing the NDA in the U.S., although there is no assurance they will accept the amendment. Further, although enrollment is complete in our first Phase III trial, we do not expect enrollment to be completed in our second Phase III trial until the end of the second quarter of 2016. Many factors could affect the timing of filing any NDA for Medidur, including completion of enrollment in the second trial in the time frame we anticipate, utilizing the data on which we currently plan to base the NDA, analyzing the data in the time frame we anticipate, requirements from regulators that would affect our timing, and the actual results from the trials. As a result, there is no assurance that an NDA for Medidur will be filed on the basis of the data we currently plan to use or that it will be filed in the first half of 2017, if at all.\nEven if we file an NDA for Medidur, there is no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA for review. While we believe the FDA will accept the filing of an NDA for Medidur based on the data we currently plan to utilize, the FDA has significant discretion in determining whether to accept an NDA for review and there is no assurance that the FDA will find the design of our clinical trials or the data we include in an NDA to be sufficient to accept the NDA for review. Any delay in the filing of an NDA for Medidur or the FDA\u2019s refusal to accept the NDA for review could materially and adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock.\nWe are currently conducting, and may in the future conduct, clinical trials for product candidates at sites outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\nWe are currently conducting a Phase III trial of Medidur in India, and may in the future choose to conduct one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States.\nIn general, the FDA accepts data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States; however, acceptance of this data is subject to, among other things, the clinical trials being conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice principles. The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to applicable locals laws, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable product candidates.\nThere is no assurance that Pfizer will exercise its option with respect to the Latanoprost Product if we initiate and complete Phase II trials or cease development, in which case we will not receive any further financial consideration under the Restated Pfizer Agreement.\nPfizer has an option for an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize the Latanoprost Product upon our completion of Phase II clinical trials, which are at our option and expense, or upon our cessation of development of the Latanoprost Product at any time prior to completion of those trials. There is no assurance that we will commence or complete Phase II clinical trials for the Latanoprost Product; that, if completed, the trials will be successful; that Pfizer will, in any event, exercise its option; that, if exercised, Pfizer will commence Phase III clinical trials; or that the Latanoprost Product will achieve successful Phase III trial results, regulatory approvals or commercial success. As a result, there is no assurance that we will receive any further licensing, milestone or royalty payments under the Restated Pfizer Agreement.\nWe do not know if we will be able to deliver proteins (including antibodies) and peptides with our Tethadur technology or that we will be able to develop product candidates or approved products using this technology.\nAlthough we are optimistic that our Tethadur technology platform can provide sustained delivery of proteins (including antibodies) and peptides, and our data from an in vitro study has shown that the long-term sustained release of antibodies such as Avastin is achievable using Tethadur, our research is at an early stage and we face challenges. Development of any product candidates is expected to require significant additional research. There is no assurance that our subsequent research will be successful or that we will be able to develop product candidates or approved products using Tethadur to deliver proteins and peptides.\nProduct development is very uncertain. If we do not develop product candidates to enter clinical trials, if we or any licensees do not initiate or complete clinical trials for our product candidates or if our product candidates do not receive the necessary regulatory approvals, neither we nor any licensees will be able to commercialize those product candidates and generate revenues for us.\nOther than Medidur for posterior uveitis, for which pivotal Phase III trials are ongoing, all of our product development is at earlier stages. Product development at all stages involves a high degree of risk, and only a\nsmall proportion of research and development programs result in product candidates that advance to pivotal clinical trials or result in approved products. There is no assurance that any feasibility study agreements we have, or enter into, with third parties, or our own research and development programs and collaborations will result in any new product candidates, or that we or any licensees will commence clinical trials for any new product candidates or continue clinical trials once commenced. If clinical trials conducted by or for us or any licensees for any product candidates do not provide the necessary evidence of safety and efficacy, those product candidates will not receive the necessary regulatory approvals, cannot be sold, and will not generate revenues for us. Initial or subsequent clinical trials may not be initiated by or for us or any licensees for product candidates or may be delayed, terminated or fail due to many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\ndecisions not to pursue development of product candidates due to pre-clinical or clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient funding;\n\u2022\ninability to attract clinical investigators for trials;\n\u2022\ninability to recruit patients in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate;\n\u2022\ndecisions by licensees not to exercise options for products or not to pursue products licensed to them;\n\u2022\nadverse side effects;\n\u2022\nfailure of trials to demonstrate a product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet FDA or other regulatory agency requirements for clinical trial design, or inadequate clinical trial design;\n\u2022\ninability to follow patients adequately after treatment;\n\u2022\nchanges in the design or manufacture of a product;\n\u2022\nfailures by, changes in our (or our licensees\u2019) relationship with, or other issues at, contract research organizations (CROs), third-party vendors and investigators responsible for pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nstability issues with clinical materials;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with current good laboratory practices (GLP), good clinical practices (GCP), cGMP or similar foreign regulatory requirements that affect the conduct of pre-clinical and clinical studies and the manufacturing of products;\n\u2022\nrequests by regulatory authorities for additional data or clinical trials;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory agency assessments of pre-clinical or clinical testing that differ from our (or our licensees\u2019) interpretations or conclusions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory delays, or changes in approval policies or regulations; and\n\u2022\ndevelopments, clinical trial results and other factors with respect to competitive products and treatments.\nResults from pre-clinical testing, early clinical trials, investigator-sponsored studies and other data and indications often do not accurately predict final pivotal clinical trial results. Data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Data from pre-clinical studies, other clinical trials and interim periods in multi-year trials are preliminary and may change, and final data from pivotal trials for such products may differ significantly. Adverse side effects may develop that delay, limit or prevent the regulatory approval of products, or cause such regulatory approvals to be limited or even rescinded. Additional trials necessary for approval may not be undertaken or may ultimately fail to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. There is no assurance, for example, that the Durasert product candidate to treat pain associated with severe knee osteoarthritis will advance to Phase III trials or will be safe or effective.\nThe FDA or other relevant regulatory agencies may not approve our product candidates for manufacture and sale, and any approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by other regulatory agencies or vice versa (which could require us to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements, possibly including additional clinical testing). Any product approvals we or our licensees achieve could also be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory standards or due to unforeseen problems after the product\u2019s marketing approval. In either case, marketing efforts with respect to the affected product would have to cease. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. The imposition by the FDA or other regulatory organizations of any such limitations on the indicated uses for which any of our products may be marketed would reduce the size of, or otherwise limit, the potential market for the product subject to such limitations.\nIn addition to testing, regulatory agencies impose various requirements on manufacturers and sellers of products under their jurisdiction, such as packaging, labeling, manufacturing practices, record keeping and reporting. Regulatory agencies may also require post-marketing testing and surveillance programs to monitor a product\u2019s effects. Furthermore, changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory approvals.\nWe do not currently have sales and marketing capacity. There is no assurance that we will have the financial resources to develop the capacity to, or be able to, successfully market and sell products if we seek to do so.\nOur strategy includes independently developing and commercializing products. We do not know when or if we will seek to directly commercialize any products ourselves. We currently have no marketing and sales staff and no experience in commercializing products. Direct commercialization would require us to develop sales and marketing capability and to make a significant financial investment. If we decide to independently and directly commercialize a product, there is no assurance we will be able to hire and manage a successful sales and marketing capability or have the financial resources necessary to fund independent commercialization of any products.\nThe success of our current and possible future collaborative and licensing arrangements depends and will depend heavily on the experience, resources, efforts and activities of our licensees, and if they are not successful in developing and marketing our products, it will adversely affect our revenues, if any, from those products.\nOur business strategy includes continuing to leverage our technology platforms by entering into collaborative and licensing arrangements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, where appropriate. The success of current and future collaborative and licensing arrangements do and will depend heavily on the experience, resources, skill, efforts and activities of our licensees. Our licensees have had, and are expected to have, significant discretion in making decisions related to the development of product candidates and the commercialization of products under these collaboration agreements. Risks that we face in connection with our collaboration and licensing strategy include the following:\n\u2022\nour collaborative and licensing arrangements are, and are expected to be, subject to termination under various circumstances, including on short notice and without cause;\n\u2022\nwe are required, and expect to be required, under our collaborative and licensing arrangements, not to conduct specified types of research and development in the field that is the subject of the arrangement or not to sell products in such field, limiting the areas of research, development and commercialization that we can pursue;\n\u2022\nour licensees may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, products that are similar to or competitive with our products;\n\u2022\nour licensees may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or decrease or fail to increase spending related to our products or product candidates, thereby limiting the ability of these products to reach their potential;\n\u2022\nour licensees may lack the funding, personnel or experience to develop and commercialize our products successfully or may otherwise fail to do so; and\n\u2022\nour licensees may not perform their obligations, in whole or in part.\nWe currently have collaboration and licensing arrangements with various companies, most significantly Alimera and Bausch & Lomb. While Bausch & Lomb has significant experience in the ophthalmic field and substantial resources, there is no assurance whether, and to what extent, that experience and those resources will be devoted to Retisert, and we do not expect revenues from Retisert to increase materially and they may decline further. Although we believe potential revenues from ILUVIEN for DME are important to our future results of operations and financial condition, Alimera has limited experience and limited financial resources, and ILUVIEN for DME is Alimera\u2019s first and only commercial product. Alimera has reported that its negative cash flows from operations and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Further, due to the limited revenue generated by Alimera to date, Alimera may not be able to maintain compliance with covenants under its loan agreement and, in the event of a default, we do not know whether Alimera will be able to obtain amendments or waivers of those covenants. We do not know if Alimera will be able to raise additional financing if and when required.\nIf our current and future licensees are not successful in developing and marketing our products, it will adversely affect our revenues, if any, from those products.\nOur current licensees may terminate their agreements with us at any time or fail to fulfill their obligations under those agreements, and, if they do, we will lose the benefits of those agreements.\nOur licensees have rights of termination under our agreements with them and could terminate those agreements without cause on short notice. Further, our licensees may fail to fulfill their obligations under their agreements, or we may disagree with them over the rights and obligations under those agreements, which could result in breach of the agreements and/or termination. Exercise of termination rights by one or more of our licensees or by us may leave us without the financial benefits and development, marketing or sales resources provided under the terminated agreement. It could be necessary for us to replace, or seek to provide ourselves, the services provided by the licensee, and there is no assurance we would be successful in doing so. It could delay, impair or stop the development or commercialization of products or product candidates licensed to them or require significant additional capital investment by us, which we may not have the resources to fund. If any of our licensees do not perform their obligations under our agreements or if any of those agreements are terminated, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf competitive products receive regulatory approval or reach the market earlier, are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more effectively marketed or cost less than our products or product candidates, our products or product candidates may not be approved, may not achieve the sales we anticipate and could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe believe that pharmaceutical, drug delivery and biotechnology companies, research organizations, governmental entities, universities, hospitals, other nonprofit organizations and individual scientists are seeking to develop drugs, therapies, products, approaches or methods to treat our targeted diseases or their underlying causes. For our targeted diseases, competitors have alternate therapies that are already commercialized or are in various stages of development, ranging from discovery to advanced clinical trials. Any of these drugs, therapies, products, approaches or methods may receive government approval or gain market acceptance more rapidly than our products and product candidates, may offer therapeutic or cost advantages, or may more effectively treat our targeted diseases or their underlying causes, which could result in our product candidates not being approved, reduce demand for our products and product candidates or render them noncompetitive or obsolete.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources than we do. Our competitors may succeed in developing alternate technologies and products that, in comparison to the products we have and are seeking to develop:\n\u2022\nare more effective and easier to use;\n\u2022\nare more economical;\n\u2022\nhave fewer side effects;\n\u2022\noffer other benefits; or\n\u2022\nmay otherwise render our products less competitive or obsolete.\nMany of these competitors have greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances and manufacturing and marketing products than we do.\nOur products and product candidates may not achieve and maintain market acceptance and may never generate significant revenues.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, the commercial success of our products and product candidates will require not only obtaining regulatory approvals, but also obtaining market acceptance by retinal specialists and other doctors, patients, government health administration authorities and other third-party payors. Whether and to what extent our products and product candidates achieve and maintain market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including demonstrated safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, potential advantages over other therapies, our and our collaborative partners\u2019 marketing and distribution efforts and the reimbursement policies of government and other third-party payors. In particular, if government and other third-party payors do not recommend our products and product candidates, limit the indications for which they are recommended, or do not provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement levels for our products, the market acceptance of our products and product candidates will be limited. Both government and other third-party payors attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for products and, accordingly, they may challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of our products, or refuse to provide coverage for our products. If our products and product candidates fail to achieve and maintain market acceptance, they may fail to generate significant revenues and our business may be significantly harmed.\nGuidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations could reduce the use of our products and potential use of product candidates.\nGovernment agencies, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations and organizations focused on various diseases may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies that affect our or our competitors\u2019 products and product candidates. Any such guidelines, recommendations or studies that reflect negatively on our products or product candidates, either directly or relative to our competitive products, could result in current or potential decreased use, sales of, and revenues from one or more of our products and product candidates. Furthermore, our success depends in part on our and our partners\u2019 ability to educate healthcare providers and patients about our products and product candidates, and these education efforts could be rendered ineffective by, among other things, third-parties\u2019 guidelines, recommendations or studies.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe rely heavily upon patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies. If we fail to protect our intellectual property or infringe on others\u2019 technologies, our ability to develop and market our products and product candidates may be compromised.\nOur success is dependent on whether we can obtain patents, defend our existing patents and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. As of August 31, 2015, we had 238 patents and 116 pending\npatent applications, including patents and pending applications covering our Durasert, Tethadur and other technologies. Intellectual property protection of our technologies is uncertain. We expect to seek to patent and protect our proprietary technologies. However, there is no assurance that any additional patents will be issued to us as a result of our pending or future patent applications or that any of our patents will withstand challenges by others. In addition, we may not have sufficient funds to patent and protect our proprietary technologies to the extent that we would desire, or at all. If we were determined to be infringing any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses, pay royalties or cease certain operations. We may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially favorable terms, if at all. In addition, many foreign country laws may treat the protection of proprietary rights differently from, and may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as, laws in the U.S. and Patent Co-operation Treaty countries.\nPrior art may reduce the scope or protection of, or invalidate, our patents. Previously conducted research or published discoveries may prevent our patents from being granted, invalidate issued patents or narrow the scope of any protection obtained. Reduction in scope of protection or invalidation of our licensed or owned patents, or our inability to obtain patents, may enable other companies to develop products that compete with our products and product candidates on the basis of the same or similar technology. As a result, our patents and those of our licensors may not provide any, or sufficient, protection against competitors. While we have not been, and are not currently, involved in any litigation over intellectual property, such litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights. We may also be sued by one or more third parties alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation would likely result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our efforts, and could prevent or delay our discovery or development of product candidates. If our competitors claim technology also claimed by us, and if they prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. or other jurisdictions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the appropriate foreign patent office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our efforts. Any such litigation or interference proceedings, regardless of the outcome, could be expensive and time consuming. Litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, requiring disputed rights to be licensed from third parties and/or requiring us to cease using certain technologies.\nWe have entered into many agreements that limit our or the third parties\u2019 rights with respect to our intellectual property, including rights to use, options on rights to use, or prohibitions on rights to use (including noncompetition obligations) our or jointly developed intellectual property. Those rights could adversely affect our rights to develop and commercialize products utilizing our intellectual property.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology that are not protected by patents to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as our corporate partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants. Any of these parties could breach these agreements and disclose our confidential information, or our competitors may learn of the information in some other way. If any material trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be materially harmed.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS\nIf we fail to retain key personnel, our business could suffer.\nWe are dependent upon the principal members of our management and scientific staff. In addition, we believe that our future success in developing and marketing our products will depend on whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel as well as a sales and marketing staff. There is strong competition for qualified personnel within the industry in which we operate, and we may not be able to attract and retain such personnel. As we have a small number of employees and we believe our products are\nunique and highly specialized, the loss of the services of one or more of the principal members of our management or scientific staff, or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel and develop expertise as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are subject to product liability suits, we may not have sufficient insurance to cover damages.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of the products utilizing our technologies involve risks that product liability claims may be asserted against us and/or our licensees. Our current clinical trial and product liability insurance may not be adequate to cover damages resulting from product liability claims. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could require us to spend significant time, money and other resources to defend such claims, could result in decreased demand for our products and product candidates, or result in reputational harm, and could result in the payment of a significant damage award. Our product liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and may not be adequate in scope to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim. Further, we may not be able to acquire sufficient clinical trial or product liability insurance in the future on reasonable commercial terms, if at all.\nConsolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may adversely affect us.\nThere has been consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Consolidation could result in the remaining companies having greater financial resources and technological capabilities, thus intensifying competition, and fewer potential collaboration partners or licensees for our product candidates. In addition, if a consolidating company is already doing business with any of our competitors, we could lose existing or potential future licensees or collaboration partners as a result of such consolidation.\nIf we or our licensees fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, our or their ability to manufacture and commercialize products may be adversely affected.\nMedical and biopharmaceutical research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as radioactive compounds and chemical solvents. We and our licensees are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and waste products. We and they could be subject to both criminal liability and civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us or them for resulting injury or contamination, and the liability may exceed our or their ability to pay. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair the research, development or production efforts of our company or our licensees and harm our operating results.\nIf we or our licensees encounter problems with product manufacturing, there could be delays in product development or commercialization, which would adversely affect our future profitability.\nOur ability and that of our licensees to conduct timely pre-clinical and clinical research and development programs, obtain regulatory approvals, and develop and commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, upon our and our licensees\u2019 ability to manufacture our products and product candidates, either directly or through third parties, in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements. The manufacture, packaging and testing of our products and product candidates are regulated by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory entities and must be conducted in accordance with applicable cGMP and comparable foreign requirements. Any change in a manufacturing process or procedure used for one of our products or product candidates, including a change in the location at which a product or product candidate is being manufactured or in the third-party manufacturer being used, may require the FDA\u2019s and similar foreign regulatory entities\u2019 prior review and/or approval in accordance with applicable cGMP or other regulations. Additionally, the FDA and similar foreign regulatory entities may implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards, for the manufacture, packaging and testing of products at any time.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP and other foreign regulations that are both capable of manufacturing our products and product candidates and are willing to do so. Alimera has contracted\nwith individual third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of ILUVIEN and its components. If any of Alimera\u2019s third-party manufacturers breach their agreements or are unable or unwilling to perform for any reason or fail to comply with cGMP and comparable foreign requirements, Alimera may not be able to locate alternative acceptable manufacturers, enter into favorable agreements with them or get them approved by the applicable regulatory authorities in a timely manner. Delays in the commercial production of ILUVIEN could delay or impair Alimera\u2019s marketing of ILUVIEN, which, in turn, could adversely affect Alimera\u2019s generation of net profits for us.\nFailure by us, our collaborative partners, or our or their third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable manufacturing requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us or our collaborative partners, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. In addition, we or our collaborative partners may not be able to manufacture our product candidates successfully or have a third party manufacture them in a cost-effective manner. If we or our collaborative partners are unable to develop our own manufacturing facilities or to obtain or retain third-party manufacturing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to conduct certain future pre-clinical and clinical testing or to supply commercial quantities of our products. We manufacture supplies in connection with pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted by us and our licensees. Our licensees have the exclusive rights to manufacture commercial quantities of products, once approved for marketing. Our and our licensees\u2019 reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of third parties to comply with cGMP and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulations and to employ adequate quality assurance practices;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain the materials necessary to produce a product or to formulate the active pharmaceutical ingredient on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nsupply disruption, deterioration in product quality or breach of a manufacturing or license agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our or our licensees\u2019 control;\n\u2022\ntermination or non-renewal of a manufacturing or licensing agreement with a third party at a time that is costly or difficult; and\n\u2022\ninability to identify or qualify an alternative manufacturer in a timely manner, even if contractually permitted to do so.\nProblems associated with international business operations could affect our or our licensees\u2019 ability to manufacture and sell our products. If we encounter such problems, our or their costs could increase and development of products could be delayed.\nWe currently maintain offices and research and development facilities in the U.S. and the U.K., and our goal is to develop products for sale by us and our licensees in major world healthcare markets. Manufacturing of pharmaceutical products requires us or our licensees to comply with regulations regarding safety and quality and to obtain country and jurisdiction-specific regulatory approvals and clearances. We or our licensees may not be able to comply with such regulations or obtain or maintain needed regulatory approvals and clearances, or may be required to incur significant costs in doing so. In addition, our operations and future revenues may be subject to a number of risks associated with foreign commerce, including the following:\n\u2022\nstaffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nforeign tax laws, tariffs and freight rates and charges;\n\u2022\ntiming and availability of export licenses;\n\u2022\ninadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022\nobtaining required government approvals.\nLegislative or regulatory changes may adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nOur industry is highly regulated and new laws, regulations and judicial decisions, and new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and judicial decisions, may adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nU.S. federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PPACA), represents one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades. The PPACA is intended to expand U.S. healthcare coverage primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. Several provisions of the PPACA could significantly reduce payments from Medicare and Medicaid for any product candidates that obtain marketing approval in the future. Federal and state legislatures within the U.S. and foreign governments will likely continue to consider changes in existing healthcare legislation. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect the demand for any products for which we or our licensees may obtain regulatory approval; our or our licensees\u2019 ability to set a price that we or they believe is fair for our products; our or our licensees\u2019 ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product; our or our licensees\u2019 ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; or the level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA. The Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 includes provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The BCA, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers beginning in 2013. More recent legislation extends reductions through 2024. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the BCA, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.\nThe FDAAA granted the FDA enhanced authority over products already approved for sale, including authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA\u2019s exercise of this relatively new authority could result in delays and increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, increased costs following regulatory approval to assure compliance with new post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on the sale or distribution of approved products following regulatory approval.\nChanges in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. For example, the July 9, 2012 reauthorization of the PDUFA extended by two months the period in which the FDA is expected to review and approve certain NDAs. Although the FDA has recently stated that it expects to meet PDUFA\u2019s updated timing goals, it has in the past provided its managers discretion to miss them due to heightened agency workload or understaffing in the review divisions. Accordingly, it remains unclear whether and to what extent the FDA will adhere to PDUFA timing goals in the future, which could delay approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price of our common stock (including common stock represented by CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs)) may be affected by developments directly affecting our business, as well as by developments out of our control or not specific to us. The biotechnology sector, in particular, and the stock market generally are vulnerable to abrupt changes in investor sentiment. Prices of securities and trading volumes of companies in the biotechnology industry, including ours, can swing dramatically in ways unrelated to, or that bear a disproportionate relationship to, our performance. The price of our common stock (and CDIs) and their trading volumes may fluctuate based on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nclinical trials and their results, and other product and technological developments and innovations;\n\u2022\nFDA and other domestic and international governmental regulatory actions, receipt and timing of approvals of our product candidates, and any denials and withdrawal of approvals;\n\u2022\ncompetitive factors, including the commercialization of new products in our markets by our competitors;\n\u2022\nadvancements with respect to treatment of the diseases targeted by our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to, and actions by, our collaborative partners, including execution, amendment and termination of agreements, achievement of milestones and receipt of payments;\n\u2022\nthe success of our collaborative partners in marketing any approved products and the amount and timing of payments to us;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of capital and our financial and operating results;\n\u2022\nactions with respect to pricing, reimbursement and coverage, and changes in reimbursement policies or other practices relating to our products or the pharmaceutical industry generally;\n\u2022\nmeeting, exceeding or failing to meet analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, and changes in evaluations and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\neconomic, industry and market conditions, changes or trends; and\n\u2022\nother factors unrelated to us or the biotechnology industry.\nIn addition, low trading volume in our common stock or our CDIs may increase their price volatility. Holders of our common stock and CDIs may not be able to liquidate their positions at the desired time or price. Finally, we will need to continue to meet the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market, including the minimum stock price, and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), for our stock and CDIs to continue to be traded on those exchanges, respectively.\nIf the holders of our outstanding warrants and stock options exercise their warrants and options, ownership of our common stock holders may be diluted, and our stock price may decline.\nAs of August 31, 2015, we had outstanding warrants and options to acquire approximately 6.1 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 17.1% of our shares on a fully diluted basis. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of these warrants and stock options could result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock and could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nAt the present time, we intend to use available funds to finance our operations. Accordingly, while payment of dividends rests within the discretion of our board of directors, no cash dividends on our common shares have been declared or paid by us and we have no intention of paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 90542, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EYPT"}
