RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Such factors could have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We believe the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:\nIf our operating results do not improve, there may be concern about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared on the basis that we will continue to operate as a going concern. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $66.3 million and notes payable of $2 million which mature in July 2022. In addition, we have generated recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations which have been due, in part, to the effects of COVID-19 and related supply chain constraints. These factors may, by themselves, cause uncertainty about our ability to continue to operate our business as a going concern. Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements describes the actions we have taken and could take to improve our liquidity to alleviate the doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur business plans and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarded expected revenues and future costs, and our ability to secure additional sources of funding if needed. However, our revenue may not meet our expectations, or our costs may exceed our estimates. Further, our estimates may change, and future events or developments may also affect our estimates. Any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage in 2022 or significantly affect our level of liquidity, which may require us to take other measures to reduce our operating costs or obtain funding in order to continue operating. Any action to reduce operating costs may negatively affect our range of products and services that we offer or our ability to deliver such products and services, which could materially impact our financial results depending on the level of cost reductions taken.\nIf we do not generate operating profits in 2022 or we are unable to raise additional capital as needed, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations as they become due.\nOur primary sources of funds to meet our liquidity and capital requirements include cash on hand, funds generated from operations including the funding from our customer financing programs, and borrowings under our bank credit facility. Our business plans and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding estimated revenues and future costs and our ability to secure sources of funding when needed. However, our revenue may not meet our expectations, or our costs may exceed our estimates. Further, our estimates may change, and future events or developments may also affect our estimates. Any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage during 2022 and beyond or significantly affect our level of liquidity. As part of our 2022 liquidity requirements, we have approximately $2 million in long-term debt that matures in July 2022 and that will need to be repaid at that time. Although we currently believe that we have adequate liquidity on hand to repay these debt obligations as and when they fall due, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could cause us to incur future operating losses and reduce our available sources of funding such that we may not be able to meet our obligations as they become due. We may also require additional capital if we seek to acquire additional businesses as a way to increase the scale of our operations and to diversify our customer and product base. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital or obtain an alternative source of credit to fund our operations in the future. Failure to raise capital or obtain alternative sources of funding when needed, on acceptable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and we may not be able to continue our business as currently contemplated.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and will likely continue to negatively affect various parts of our business and will likely continue to result in reduced demand from our customers as their businesses may also be negatively affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an immediate and ongoing impact on our operations in both our facilities segment and our systems integration segment since it began in March 2020. Travel restrictions and other customer actions that have restricted physical access to customers sites have negatively impacted our facilities segment because we have been unable to access customer locations to provide our services. This contributed to a decrease in our overall facilities segment revenue in 2021, including a $1.8 million or 54% decrease in revenue from deployment of new modular data centers compared to 2020. Our systems integration business has also seen a revenue decline due to the pandemic and has been negatively impacted due to logistical and supply-chain issues that have impacted component supply to us. The second half of 2021 in particular experienced component shortages and our OEM partner was unable to provide us with all of the necessary IT components required to complete our integration services for a number of projects, negatively impacting our revenue and profitability. We also incurred additional personnel and operating costs to meet health and safety guidelines imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic so that we could continue to operate our integration facility throughout the pandemic, although during 2021 we have been able to reduce the level of incremental costs that we are incurring due to the pandemic. The spread of the virus into our workforce could result in us having to temporarily disable our facilities preventing us from generating revenue. Similarly, if our customers or suppliers continue to experience adverse business consequences due to COVID-19 or any other pandemic, demand for our services could also be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. The magnitude and duration of potential social, economic and labor instability as a direct result of COVID-19 cannot be easily estimated at this time and can and will change as the pandemic evolves. Should any of these potential impacts continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may experience net losses in the future.\nAlthough we recorded net income in 2020, we had a net loss in 2021 and we recorded operating losses in both 2021 and 2020. We have a history of recurring net annual losses in prior years and at December 31, 2021 we had accumulated losses of approximately $66.3 million. We believe that changes we have made to the business in recent years, including the addition of procurement and reseller services and changes to our operating cost structure have improved our operating results and allowed us to achieve multiple profitable quarters in each of the last several years, but we do have a history of fluctuating operating results. Our efforts to align costs with sales and gross margin volume have reduced our level of overhead, but there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in sustaining or increasing profitability in 2022 or beyond. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated our operating results and there is no certainty regarding how long this pandemic will continue to negatively impact our operations and financial results. The uncertainty of a rapidly changing marketplace and the pandemic has created a volatile and challenging business climate, which may continue to negatively impact our customers and their spending and investment decisions. We may not be able to generate the level of revenue necessary to achieve and maintain sustainable profitability. Any failure to maintain and grow our revenue volumes would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from one customer.\nWe currently derive and believe that we will continue to derive in the near term a significant portion of our revenues from one OEM customer. We provide a range of different services and generate revenue from multiple business units and divisions of this OEM customer. To the extent that any significant business unit or division of this OEM customer uses less of our services or terminates its relationship with us, or this OEM reorganizes its business units and divisions in such a way that directly impacts the level of business with us, our revenues would decline significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations. Revenues from this OEM customer comprised 95% and 97% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe are attempting to diversify our customer base but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so.\nAfter the sale of certain components of our business in 2018 and 2017, our customer concentration increased and revenue from our three largest customers comprised 99% of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We are continuing our efforts to add new revenue streams such as our procurement and reseller services that we began offering in 2019, as well as targeting other vendors in the data center infrastructure market including Value Added Resellers and systems integrators who have the need for IT integration services. We are also targeting other vendors in the modular data center market to leverage our expertise and capabilities in this marketplace. Our efforts to successfully add new relationships has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and taken us longer than anticipated. While we believe our efforts will allow us to broaden our customer base and reduce our customer concentration, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful at these endeavors, or of the time that it will take for these efforts to be successful.\nOur procurement and reseller services business is still evolving and the level of this business may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, requiring additional working capital in order to grow.\nWe began providing procurement and reseller services to our customers in September 2019. We do not yet have a history of stable and ongoing contracts with customers for our procurement and reseller services and as a result we have experienced material fluctuations in our quarterly revenues from these services, which has had a material impact on our revenues and profits. We have been able to structure our procurement and reseller activities in such a way as to minimize their overall impact on our liquidity by using trade creditors as the primary way to finance these activities. However, depending on the size of potential procurement and reseller contracts, we may be required to procure material amounts of hardware, software and professional services from other third parties and there can be no guarantee that our existing sources of liquidity or available trade finance will be sufficient to enable us to finance these transactions.\nAs the age of modular data centers increases and customers look to shut or replace such units, our recurring maintenance revenues could be negatively impacted, and this could adversely affect our operating results.\nModular Data Centers (MDC\u2019s) typically have an expected useful life between 5-8 years unless refreshed with new IT equipment. As they approach the end of their expected life, we would expect customers to terminate the annual maintenance contracts for those MDC\u2019s which would cause the level of maintenance revenues and our profitability to be negatively impacted unless the units are immediately replaced. Our history suggests that customers will replace MDC\u2019s with new modules that will also be subject to an annual maintenance contract. However, the time period between these two events could result in an overall decrease in our level of maintenance revenues and our overall level of revenue in our facilities business.\nWe have substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangibles, and changes in future business conditions could cause these assets to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from prior acquisitions of businesses. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination that are determined to have indefinite useful lives, but instead review them annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. We are amortizing certain other intangibles over their useful lives. To the extent we determine that such assets have been impaired, we will write-down their carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet and book an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations. During each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we conducted such analyses that resulted in no impairment. The net carrying value of goodwill totaled $0.8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the net carrying value of finite lived intangible assets totaled $0.1 and $0.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could reduce our growth opportunities, revenue and operating results.\nThe mission-critical information technology industry in which we operate is highly competitive and continues to become more competitive. We often compete against divisions of large information technology consulting and integration companies, including several that are large domestic companies that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. These larger competitors have an infrastructure and support greater than ours, and accordingly, we continue to experience some price pressure as some companies are willing to take on projects at lower margins. Our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Our size often prevents us from bidding on larger, more profitable projects, which significantly reduces our growth opportunities. Although our customers currently outsource a significant portion of these services to us and our competitors, we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services to us in the future.\nMost of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, so our revenue and potential profits are not guaranteed.\nMost of our contracts are cancelable on short notice by the customer either at its convenience or upon our default. If one of our customers terminates a contract at its convenience, then we typically are able to recover only costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination, which could prevent us from recognizing all of our potential revenue and profit from that contract. If one of our customers terminates the contract due to our default, we could be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer in re-procuring services from another source, as well as other costs. Many of our contracts, including our service agreements, are periodically open to bid. We may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are re-bid. We also provide a portion of our services on a non-recurring, project-by-project basis. We could experience a reduction in our revenue, profitability and liquidity if our customers cancel a significant number of contracts, we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re-bid or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects. In addition, we provide services under certain master service agreements. If these agreements are terminated, we would be unable to provide on-going services to those customers.\nWe submit change orders to our customers for work we perform beyond the scope of some of our contracts. If our customers do not approve these change orders, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe typically submit change orders under some of our contracts for payment of work performed beyond the initial contractual requirements. The applicable customers may not approve or may contest these change orders and we cannot assure you that these claims will be approved in whole, in part or at all. If these claims are not approved, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not accurately estimate the costs associated with services provided under fixed-price contracts, which could impair our financial performance.\nApproximately 85% of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of our services and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to estimate accurately the costs associated with our services. These costs may be affected by a variety of factors, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, and higher than expected costs of materials and labor. Certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated or losses if actual costs for contracts exceed our estimates, which could reduce our profitability and liquidity.\nWe warranty customer equipment against failure in some of our fixed price contracts, and a major equipment failure could have a material impact on our financial performance.\nUnder some of our maintenance contracts we provide limited warranties for the continued performance of equipment, including batteries and actuators used in modular data centers. We estimate the anticipated failure or replacement rate of this equipment, but if a customer location experienced a failure rate of equipment greater than we anticipated, we would incur higher equipment replacement costs and incur a loss on that maintenance contract, and potentially this could have a material negative impact on our profitability and liquidity.\nWe may choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay or delay paying us for the related services.\nWe use subcontractors to perform many portions of our services and to manage workflow. In some cases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail to pay, or delay paying us for the related work, we could experience a decrease in profitability and liquidity.\nThe industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological, structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues.\nThe mission-critical information technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer and data center needs. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the mission-critical information technology industry. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Improvements in existing technology may allow companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer or end-user could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel and the loss of any of our key executive officers may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled, knowledgeable, sophisticated and qualified managerial, professional and technical personnel. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of employees. Accordingly, our employees are one of our most valuable resources. Competition for skilled personnel is intense in our industry. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources particularly when seeking qualified staff in remote locations where a number of our customers operate their data centers. Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers\u2019 needs, limit our ability to win new business and constrain our future growth.\nIf we are unable to engage appropriate subcontractors or if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur contract performance may involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. Our inability to find and engage appropriate subcontractors or a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.\nIn extreme cases, a subcontractor\u2019s performance deficiency could result in the customer terminating the contract for default with us. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of procurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders.\nSecurity breaches and attacks on our computer systems could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business, financial results and reputation.\nWe are reliant upon a number of third party and internally-developed software programs to operate our business. We store and transmit our own as well as customer information and data, including individual data of and about their end-user customers. Maintaining the security and availability of our services, network and internal IT systems and the security of information we hold is a critical issue for us and our customers. Any software failure or corruption, including cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, could lead to the dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, customers and end-user customers, could threaten our ability to provide services to our customers, generate negative publicity about us, result in litigation and increased legal liability or costs or lead to government inquiry or oversight. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, lead to loss of customers, higher expenses and possibly impede our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers.\nA successful assault on our infrastructure would be damaging to our reputation and could adversely affect our financial condition. Similar security risks exist with respect to our business partners and the third-party vendors we rely on for aspects of our information technology infrastructure, support services and administrative functions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities of our business partners and third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly impact our systems.\nBecause we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use in the operations and expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on factors our board of directors deems relevant, including, among others, our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, business prospects, and the terms of our credit facility and other financing arrangements. Accordingly, realization of a gain on stockholders\u2019 investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchased their shares.\nOur insiders beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. Future sales of common stock by these insiders may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur officers, directors or their affiliates beneficially own approximately 7.1 million shares of common stock or approximately 31% of our outstanding common shares as of March 30, 2022. Stock sales by our directors and officers are subject to compliance with our Code of Conduct and preapproval process from the Chief Financial Officer. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market could decrease the market price of our common stock. In addition, the perception that such sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Future issuances or sales of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur shares are thinly traded and may not be readily marketable.\nOur shares are not widely traded, and daily trading volume is generally very low compared with most publicly traded companies. As a result, you may not be able to readily resell your shares in the company.\nOur common stock may be characterized as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC regulations.\nOur common stock may be characterized as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC regulations. As such, broker-dealers dealing in our common stock may be subject to the disclosure rules for transactions involving penny stocks, which generally require that, prior to a purchase, the broker-dealer determine if purchasing the common stock is suitable for the applicable purchaser. The broker-dealer must also obtain the written consent of the applicable purchasers to purchase the common stock and disclose the best bid and offer prices available for the common stock and the price at which the broker-dealer last purchased or sold the common stock. These additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage them from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could make it difficult for an investor to sell his, her or its shares at any given time", "PERMNO": 92218, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "TSSI"}
