{"cik": "84748", "company": "ROGERS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our stock. The risks discussed below are those that we believe are currently the most significant, although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nThe global credit and financial markets, despite recently demonstrating increased stability, could experience additional disruption, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nConditions in the global credit and financial markets continue to be uncertain and there can be no assurances that there will not be future deterioration in credit and financial markets and in confidence in overall economic conditions. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Adverse global economic conditions in our markets will likely negatively impact our business, which could result in the following conditions, among others:\n\u2022\nReduced demand for our products;\n\u2022\nIncreased price competition for our products;\n\u2022\nIncreased credit or other financial difficulties at our suppliers that could result in delays in their ability to supply us with necessary raw materials, components or finished products;\n\u2022\nIncreased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\n\u2022\nIncreased risk of the collectability of cash from our customers;\n\u2022\nIncreased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\nHigher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.\nContinued or additional volatility in the global credit and financial markets could also have a significant impact on our ability to generate returns on our investment portfolio, our ability to obtain financing, and consequently, our ability to further diversify our business through strategic acquisitions or other alliances (an important component of our long-term growth strategy), and our ability to obtain and hold insurance, among other things. Our investments and certain other assets are impacted by market conditions, including conditions that affect interest rates and the liquidity and creditworthiness of the banks and other intermediaries through which we hold investments, and any decrease in their or our ability to liquidate our investments could negatively affect our financial position.\nOur future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.\nOur future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe effects of adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our materials;\n\u2022\nloss of or significant declines in sales to key customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers, or our competitors;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of copper and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and testing capacity;\n\u2022\nsignificant declines in backlog;\n\u2022\nthe timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;\n\u2022\nchanges in geographic, product, or customer mix;\n\u2022\nthe effects of the expiration of issued patents;\n\u2022\nour ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;\n\u2022\npotential significant litigation-related costs;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;\n\u2022\nthe costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rates in the U.S., China or other jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.\nIn addition, the market segments on which we are currently focused require products that (i) enable the growth of the Internet and the increased performance of mobile communication devices; (ii) support the reliability and efficiency of clean energy technology;\nand (iii) improve the performance and comfort of mass transit systems. These markets have been characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, these industries have experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles, reductions in government spending, and declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production over-capacity and accelerated price erosion. Our business is also subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of this and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, improve our products, develop and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.\nOur future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to develop new products and improve our product and process technologies. Our success in these efforts will be determined by our ability to anticipate market requirements in our product development efforts, and the acceptance and continued commercial success of the end user's products. Additionally, our success depends upon our ability to adapt to technological changes and to support established and emerging industry standards.\nIn particular, some of the markets on which we focus are characterized by frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards, rapid changes in product and process technologies, price competition and many new potential applications. To continue to be successful in these areas, we must be able to consistently develop, produce and supply materials that meet the demanding expectations of customers for quality, performance and reliability at competitive prices. Our timely introduction of new products to meet these needs could be affected by engineering or other development program delays and problems in effectively and efficiently increasing production to meet customer needs. In addition, rapid technological change, significant pricing pressures and short lead times characterize the end-use markets for devices and equipment into which our products are often incorporated. Because we manufacture and sell our own materials to meet the needs of these markets, our results may be negatively affected by these factors.\nA significant amount of the Company\u2019s profits and cash flow are derived from a limited number of key products and any changes in technology or other events that adversely affect the market for these products could have a material and negative impact on our financial results.\nOur ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends upon the level of profitability of a limited number of key products. As a result, although these products are used in a diverse range of applications, any event that adversely affects the markets for these key products could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results. These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, unavailability of the raw materials needed to manufacture the products, increased competition from the introduction of new products, and technological evolution.\nAdditionally, emerging material technologies could replace our key products in certain applications, resulting in a decline in demand for the products. Disruptive technologies may reduce or eliminate the need for our key products. New process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage. Our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others, enabling them to compete with us. If any of these events had a material adverse effect on the sales of our key products, loss of revenue, reduced margins, material charges and a significant reduction in profitability could result.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is possible that competitors and other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products, and processes. Moreover, the laws and/or judicial systems of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.\nThere can be no assurances that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. If our patents do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents. We may also be negatively affected by, and subject to increased competition as a result of, the normal expiration of our issued patents.\nWe try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.\nWe are exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations.\nWe have significant foreign operations, particularly in Asia and Europe, which exposes us to business, political and economic changes that could negatively impact our future sales, expenses and financial condition. For fiscal 2014, sales of our products to foreign customers accounted for approximately 75.8% of our net sales. As of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 1,900 employees in Europe and Asia.\nIt is anticipated that with the passage of time, design decisions related to the products we make will be increasingly made by Asian, rather than European or North American-based, original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d). There can be no assurance that we will be as successful obtaining design wins with respect to these Asian OEMs as we historically have been with European and North American OEMs.\nAlthough we engage in hedging transactions to help reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\nAlso, potential interest rate increases, as well as high energy and other consumer costs, could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products and the products which contain our materials.\nWhile a substantial portion of our cash is generated outside the U.S., we require a significant amount of cash in the U.S. to address our operating requirements, the funding of acquisitions, debt and interest payments and other business expenditures. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through our U.S. operations cash flows, we could repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, increase our borrowings under our current credit facility, or raise capital from other sources. These alternatives would adversely affect our operating results as they would result in higher effective tax rates and increased interest expense.\nWe are also subject to the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies. Other business risks associated with international operations include, but are not limited to, increased managerial complexities; air transportation disruptions; expropriation; currency controls; additional costs related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate increases; exposure to different business practices and differing legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection and data privacy; intellectual property and environmental compliance; trade and travel restrictions; pandemics; import and export license requirements and restrictions; difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations; longer accounts receivable cycles and collections; and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added tax, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organization and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into the U.S., without incurring adverse tax consequences.\nWe expect our business to continue to have a strong presence in Asia, particularly in China, in the foreseeable future, as the Asian marketplace is a key factor to our current and future success. Our operations in these markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent, as there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, or U.S. and China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, potentially resulting in increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operational results.\nAvailability of and changes in the costs and quality of certain key raw materials could negatively impact our profit margins and our ability to produce products in a timely manner to required specifications.\nWe use certain key raw materials in our manufacturing processes, including, but not limited to, copper and certain types of resins, ceramic materials and chemicals, all of which could be subject to price volatility due to availability, demand and global monetary policies. In addition, these materials are often obtained from single or limited sources that expose us to price increases and material shortages and increase the potential for inconsistent incoming material quality. Any inability to obtain timely deliveries of materials\nof acceptable quantity or quality, or a significant increase in the prices of materials, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The loss of the services of one or more of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nImplementation of our acquisition and divestiture strategies may not be successful, which could affect our ability to increase our revenue or our profitability.\nA key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses, assets, products, or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. Accordingly, our future performance will be impacted by our ability to identify appropriate businesses and technologies to acquire, as well as effectively and efficiently integrating such acquisitions into Rogers. We may not succeed in such endeavors for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the inability to identify businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, the possibility that we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all and, if we do make an acquisition, the possibility that we may not be able to effectively integrate the acquisition into Rogers.\nAn acquisition can require a significant level of investment. This would potentially require borrowing funds through our credit facility, which would create long-term debt and make us subject to the various covenant requirements contained in the related credit agreement. Certain risks are inherent in any acquisition, such as the risk that the acquisition may not be accretive to our business or perform to our expectations going forward and that revenue opportunities, cost savings and other anticipated synergies will not be fully realized.\nWe also continually review our current business and product portfolio to attempt to maximize our business performance. We may in the future deem it appropriate to pursue the divestiture of product lines or businesses as conditions dictate. These strategic decisions could have a potential negative impact on our business. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products that we offer. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nWe are involved with certain litigation and disputes and may become involved in future litigation or other disputes all of which could give rise to potential contingencies, such as environmental, product liability and/or warranty claims, that could be costly to bring or defend and could result in a significant negative impact to our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits arising out of the conduct of our business that could ultimately have a material adverse impact on our business, including our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Such claims could result from environmental issues, product liability claims and general commercial litigation, among others.\nOur products are typically highly specialized, proprietary materials that must meet very stringent performance requirements. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products to meet our product specifications. However, if any of our materials or products contain or are alleged to contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs or defend product liability claims arising from the alleged defects.\nWe are also subject to a variety of environmental issues, particularly considering the age of our business and the range of geographic areas and manufacturing processes we have been involved in over the course of time. Our estimation of any environmental liability is based on an evaluation of currently available information with respect to the situation, including existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and our past experience in addressing environmental matters. However, there can be no assurances that our estimates will not be disputed or that any ultimate liability concerning this site will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are currently engaged in proceedings involving a superfund site, as a participant in a group of potentially responsible parties (PRPs). Although current regulations impose potential joint and several liability upon each named party at any superfund site, we expect our contribution for cleanup to be limited due to the number of other PRPs, and our share of the alleged contributions of waste to the site, which we believe is de minimis. We are also involved in the remediation of certain polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination at our Woodstock, Connecticut manufacturing facility. In addition, Rogers Corporate Headquarters located in Rogers, CT, has entered into the Voluntary Corrective Action program with the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) to meet the RCRA (Resource Conservation Recovery Act) Corrective Action program requirements related to potential contamination at its site in Rogers, CT.\nFurther, we are involved in certain asbestos-related product liability litigation. The level of such litigation has escalated in certain U.S. states in recent years and involves hundreds of companies that have been named as defendants. At December 31, 2014, there were 438 claims pending against us. We expect that additional claims will be brought against us in the future. Our ultimate liability with respect to such pending and unasserted claims is subject to various uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe number of claims that are brought in the future;\n\u2022\nthe costs of defending and settling these claims;\n\u2022\nthe risk of exhaustion of applicable insurance policies;\n\u2022\nthe risk of insolvencies among our insurance carriers;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require us to pay damages in amounts greater than the amounts for which we have historically settled claims; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of adverse changes in the Federal and State laws governing the compensation of asbestos claimants.\nWe believe we have sufficient insurance to cover the majority of costs related to these claims and that we have valid defenses to the majority of these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. However, there can be no assurances that the ultimate resolution of these matters will be consistent with our expectations and will not have a material adverse effect on us. For further information, see Item 3 Legal Proceedings and Note 14 of this Form 10-K.\nWe are subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations, which could increase our expense and affect our operating results.\nOur business is subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, gases and other substances used or produced in our various manufacturing processes. Public attention to environmental controls has continued to increase and changes in environmental regulations may require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment or alter the way our products are made. In addition, we use hazardous and regulated materials that subject us to risks for strict liability for damages caused by accidental releases, regardless of fault. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results.\nNew climate change regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes worldwide or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be harder to procure for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in additional costs for us. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our business plans and results of operations.\nOur current reserve levels may not be adequate to cover potential exposures.\nWe establish reserves to cover various exposures, including uncollectible accounts receivable, excess or obsolete inventory, fair market value write-downs of certain assets, and various other liabilities. However, these reserves may not be adequate to cover future impairments or losses. These reserves are subject to analysis and adjustment on a regular basis and are based on management's best estimates based on the facts and circumstances known at the time. Such reserves are subject to many uncertainties, including the assumptions used to value certain assets, forward looking forecasted financial information, and bankruptcy or financial problems at key customers, among others. In the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable or reasonably estimable, facts and circumstances could change related to such matters that could result in such matters being decided against us and require the payment of damages or other expenditures in amounts that are not presently accrued. The effects on our financial results of many of these factors depend in some cases on our ability to obtain insurance covering potential losses.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding line of credit.\nAt December 31, 2014, we have $60.0 million of outstanding debt remaining out of a total credit facility of approximately $265 million. In the first quarter of 2015, we borrowed $125.0 million against this line of credit to finance our strategic acquisition of Arlon, LLC. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon the cash flows generated from our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things, seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; sell selected assets; reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or reduce or delay planned operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing, or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms. In addition, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nRestrictions in our credit facility may limit our activities and materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows.\nOur current credit facility imposes, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, certain restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit the Company, including undertaking certain transactions, creating certain credit liens on our assets and incurring certain subsidiary indebtedness, among others. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on the cash flows generated from our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control, as further discussed in this Item 1A Risk Factors. In addition, our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our credit facility and we do not obtain appropriate waivers, our operations may be negatively impacted by the consequences of such breaches, including the declaration of any outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable.\nChanges in tax rates and exposure may lead to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, increases in tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or in tax laws, each of which could adversely affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a tax authority could adversely affect profitability.\nEvaluations of goodwill, non-amortizable assets and other investments for impairment may result in a write-off of all or a portion of our recorded amounts, which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe perform an impairment review of goodwill, non-amortizable intangible assets and other investments on an annual basis, or when facts and circumstances surrounding such assets indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred. In 2014, we did not have an impairment of our goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets. However, in the fourth quarter of 2014, management believed, based on a lack of positive business performance and a round of financing that we did not participate in, that our investment in Solicore had become impaired. As a result, this investment went through an evaluation process and we recognized an impairment of $0.2 million on our investment in Solicore in the fourth quarter of 2014. See Note 8 - Investment for further details on this impairment charge. Going forward, there can be no assurances that future impairments of goodwill, non-amortizable intangible assets or other investments will not occur. Any impairment may result in a write-off of all or a portion of our recorded amounts, which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely from the beginning of fiscal year 2014 through the end of fiscal year 2014, with our stock price reaching a high of $82.48 per share and a low of $51.40 per share during that time period. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors affecting our stock price may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in the long-term outlook for our Company in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nvariations in operating results from quarter to quarter;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts' expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market value of publicly traded customers or suppliers, which could decrease their demand for our products;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the industries and markets in which we participate;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical changes, hostilities or natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods; and\n\u2022\nlow trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the New York Stock Exchange can experience significant price and volume fluctuations and continued market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nEmployee benefit cost increases could reduce our profitability.\nOur profitability is affected by employee benefit costs, particularly medical, pension and other employee benefits. In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S. These factors will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance, as employee benefit costs continue to escalate. Although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe also sponsor a limited number of defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees. Our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans have risen dramatically in recent years, and are dependent upon a number of factors and assumptions that drive our projected liabilities and annual expenses, such as discount rates, the actual and projected rates of return on the plans' assets, governmental regulation, global equity prices, portfolio composition and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Changes in assumptions, the ability to grow our pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans' assets, and other factors relating to worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, could all have a negative impact on our pension plans, which could result in an increase in our pension liabilities, a reduction in the funded status of our plan, increases in annual expense recognized related to the plans, and requirements to increase funding for some or all of our defined benefit pension plans, among other factors, all of which could negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nTo mitigate some of these risks, we amended our U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2013 and participants no longer accrue benefits under such plans, effectively freezing the plans going forward. While the risks outlined above will remain in force, the freezing of the plans will reduce overall risk, as we no longer accrue new benefit obligations, thus reducing projected future liabilities and annual plan expenses.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business/operating revenues, margins, competitive position and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business/operating revenues, margins, competitive position and reputation.\nOur business could be negatively affected by collective labor arrangements and labor laws.\nWe have two U.S. collective bargaining units; one of which was acquired through the acquisition of Arlon, LLC in the first quarter of 2015, and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce our labor costs by streamlining existing manufacturing facilities and in restructuring our business because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers.\nOur business could be negatively affected by unanticipated events that are beyond our control.\nOur business and operating results may be affected by certain events that we cannot anticipate and that are beyond our control, such as natural disasters and national emergencies, which could disrupt production at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers and suppliers, and cause delayed deliveries, canceled orders and possibly loss of market share. From time to time, we purchase certain raw materials from single or limited sources, and, even if our facilities are not directly affected by such events, we could be affected by interruptions of production at our suppliers. In addition, our customers could be affected by certain events, which could decrease demand for our products.", "PERMNO": 35991, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "ROG"}
