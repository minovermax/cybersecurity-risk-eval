RISK FACTORS\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Additional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in \"Item 1. Business - Forward-Looking Information.\" However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks we may face.\nAny risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses and decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.\nGeneral Economic and Market Conditions Risk\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by current conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nThe global financial markets have undergone and may continue to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions, which have an adverse effect on our business. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. While economic conditions have improved since 2009, the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain as economic activity continues to face difficulties due to cautious business spending, the variable rate of U.S. economic growth, weak commodity prices, low oil prices, low wage growth offsetting the improved levels of unemployment, currency exchange rate volatility and its effect on export growth, and the slowing and negative economic growth and other continuing economic developments in Europe and Asia.\nA sustained weakness or further weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business:\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for loans and leases and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022\na decrease in deposit balances due to overall reductions in the accounts of customers;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of our loans or other assets secured by real estate;\n\u2022\na decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022\nan impairment of certain intangible assets; or\n\u2022\nan increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\nHigher crude oil production levels have led to increased global oil supplies resulting in significant declines in market oil prices. As of December 31, 2015, the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was approximately $37 compared to approximately $53 as of December 31, 2014, and has since declined to $29 as of February 16, 2016. Decreased market oil prices have compressed margins for many U.S.-based oil producers, particularly those that utilize higher-cost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. A prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the U.S. economy. As of December 31, 2015, oil and gas-related loans and leases totaled $137.3 million and comprised less than 1% of our loan and lease portfolio.\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions generally have an adverse effect on our business, and there can be no assurance that the economic recovery will be sustainable in the near term. If economic conditions worsen or remain volatile, we expect our business, financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected.\nPublic equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our Square 1 Bank Division clients or a slowdown in venture capital investment levels may reduce the market for venture capital investment and the borrowing needs of our current and potential clients, which could adversely affect our ability to grow and our financial performance.\nOur Square 1 Bank Division\u2019s strategy is focused on providing banking products and services to entrepreneurial businesses, including in particular early- and expansion-stage companies that receive financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capital or private equity firms, and corporate investors. We derive a meaningful share of deposits from these companies and provide them with loans as well as other banking products and services. In many cases, our credit decisions are based on our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital-backed client will receive additional rounds of equity capital from investors. If the amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the number of new clients and investor financial support to our existing borrowers would decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on the loan and deposit growth prospects of this division.\nCredit Risk\nCredit Risk is the Risk of Loss Arising from the Inability or Failure of a Borrower or Counterparty to Meet its Obligation.\nWe may not recover all amounts that are contractually owed to us by our borrowers.\nWe are dependent on loan and lease principal, interest, and fee collections to partially fund our operations. A shortfall in collections and proceeds may impair our ability to fund our operations or to repay our existing debt.\nWhen we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk. The credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We expect to experience charge-offs and delinquencies on our loans and leases in the future. Our clients' actual operating results may be worse than our underwriting indicated when we originated the loans and leases, and in these circumstances, if timely corrective actions are not taken, we could incur substantial impairment or loss of the value on these loans and leases. We may fail to identify problems because our client did not report them in a timely manner or, even if the client did report the problem, we may fail to address it quickly enough or at all. Even if clients provide us with full and accurate disclosure of all material information concerning their businesses, we may misinterpret or incorrectly analyze this information. Mistakes may cause us to make loans and leases that we otherwise would not have made, to fund advances that we otherwise would not have funded, result in losses on one or more of our loans and leases, or necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. As a result, we could suffer loan losses and have nonperforming loans and leases, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, net income and results of operations and financial condition, to the extent the losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses.\nOur concentration of loans and leases to privately owned small and medium-sized companies and to a limited number of clients within a particular industry or region could expose us to greater lending risk if the market sector, industry or region were to experience economic difficulties or changes in the regulatory environment.\nOur portfolio consists primarily of commercial loans and leases to small and medium-sized, privately owned businesses in a limited number of industries and regions throughout the United States.\nCommercial loans and leases comprised 55% of our total portfolio at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, our largest commercial loan type concentration was cash flow loans, which includes leveraged loans as defined by regulatory guidance, totaling 21% of our portfolio. Cash flow loans are provided to sophisticated buyers and private equity groups, financial investors, strategic companies and sponsors to finance the acquisition or recapitalization of a business. Other significant commercial concentrations by loan type include asset-based loans at 18% and equipment finance at 6% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2015. Venture capital loans were 10% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2015, and represent venture capital loans acquired in the Square 1 acquisition.\nAs of December 31, 2015, real estate mortgage loans and real estate construction and land loans (which are predominantly commercial real estate mortgage loans) comprised 44% of our total portfolio and our largest property type concentration was healthcare property, totaling 21% of real estate mortgage loans. Other significant real estate mortgage loan property type concentrations were multi-family properties at 14% and office properties at 12% at December 31, 2015. In addition, 49% of our loans secured by real estate were in California at December 31, 2015.\nIf any particular industry or geographic region were to experience economic difficulties, the overall timing and amount of collections on our loans to clients operating in those industries or geographic regions may differ from what we expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, compared to larger, publicly owned firms, privately owned small and medium-sized companies generally have limited access to capital and higher funding costs, may be in a weaker financial position and therefore more susceptible to economic downturns or volatility and may need more capital to expand or compete. These financial challenges may make it difficult for our clients to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on our loans and leases. Accordingly, loans and leases made to these types of clients entail higher risks than loans and leases made to companies that are able to access a broader array of credit sources. The concentration of our portfolio in loans and leases to these types of clients could amplify these risks.\nFurther, there is no publicly available information about the majority of the small and medium-sized privately owned companies to which we lend. Therefore, we underwrite our loans and leases based on detailed financial information and projections provided to us by our clients and we must rely on our clients and the due diligence efforts of our employees to obtain the information relevant to making our credit decisions. We rely upon the management of these companies to provide full and accurate disclosure of material information concerning their business, financial condition and prospects. We may not have access to all of the material information about a particular client's business, financial condition and prospects, or a client's accounting records may be poorly maintained or organized. The client's business, financial condition and prospects may also change rapidly in the current economic environment. In such instances, we may not make a fully informed credit decision which may lead, ultimately, to a failure or inability to recover our loan or lease in its entirety.\nThe collateral securing a loan or lease may not be sufficient to protect us if we have not properly obtained or perfected a lien on such collateral or if the collateral value does not cover the loan or lease.\nSome of our loans and leases are secured by a lien on specified collateral of the client and we may not obtain or properly perfect our liens or the value of the collateral securing any particular loan may not protect us from suffering a partial or complete loss if the loan becomes nonperforming and we proceed to foreclose on or repossess the collateral. In such event, we could suffer loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, net income, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, cash flow lending involves lending money to a client based primarily on the expected cash flow, profitability and enterprise value of a client rather than on the value of its assets. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 21% of our portfolio was comprised of cash flow loans, which includes leveraged loans as defined by regulatory guidance. Although the estimated value of the enterprise is significantly in excess of our loan balance at the time of origination, the value of the stand-alone assets which we hold as collateral for these loans is typically substantially less than the amount of money we advance to a client under these loans. When a cash flow loan becomes nonperforming, our primary recourse to recover some or all of the principal of our loan is to force the sale of the entire company as a going concern or restructure the company in a way we believe would enable it to generate sufficient cash flow over time to repay our loan. Neither of these alternatives may be an available or viable option or generate enough proceeds to repay the loan.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan and lease defaults and non-performance and a reserve for unfunded loan commitments, which, when combined, we refer to as the allowance for credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our allowance for credit losses is based on prior experience and an evaluation of the risks inherent in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Our federal and state regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and leases and allowance for credit losses. While we believe our allowance for credit losses is appropriate for the risk identified in our loan and lease portfolio, we cannot provide assurance that we will not further increase the allowance for credit losses, that it will be sufficient to address losses, or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for more information.\nMarket Risk\nMarket Risk is the Risk that Market Conditions May Adversely Impact the Value of Assets or Liabilities or Otherwise Negatively Impact Earnings. Market Risk is Inherent to the Financial Instruments Associated with our Operations, Including Loans, Deposits, Securities, Short-term Borrowings, Long-term Debt, Trading Account Assets and Liabilities, and Derivatives.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits. It is expected that we will continue to realize income from the differential or \"spread\" between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates generally affect loan volume, loan yields, funding sources and funding costs. Our net interest spread depends on many factors that are partly or completely out of our control, including competition, federal economic monetary and fiscal policies, and general economic conditions.\nWhile an increase in interest rates may increase our loan yield, it may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers with variable-rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. Following an increase in interest rates, our ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is dependent on our ability to increase our loan offering rates, replace loan maturities with new originations, minimize increases on our deposit rates, and maintain an acceptable level and mix of funding. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to increase our loan offering rates and continue to originate loans due to the competitive landscape in which we operate. Additionally, we cannot provide assurances that we can minimize the increases in our deposit rates while maintaining an acceptable level of deposits. Finally, we cannot provide any assurances that we can maintain our current levels of noninterest-bearing deposits as customers may seek higher-yielding products when rates increase.\nAccordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, liquidity, and overall profitability.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our periodic operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\ncyber security breaches;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; or\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility during the past several years and the future performance of the stock market is inherently uncertain. As a result, the stock market generally and the market price of our common stock specifically may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur. The trading price of our common stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, and future sales of our equity or equity-related securities. A significant decline in our stock price could result in the potential impairment of goodwill, substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation.\nThe value of our securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned $3.6 billion of investment securities available-for-sale, or 17% of our total assets. The fair value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio. We analyze our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity Risk is the Potential Inability to Meet our Contractual and Contingent Financial Obligations, On- or Off-balance Sheet, as they Become Due.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investment securities and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market disruption, a decrease in the borrowing capacity assigned to our pledged assets by our secured creditors, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally as a result of conditions faced by banking organizations in the domestic and worldwide credit markets.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments, regulatory requirements, and business needs. As a publicly traded company, a likely source of additional funds is the capital markets, accomplished generally through the issuance of equity, both common and preferred stock, and the issuance of subordinated debentures. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. Deterioration in economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of liquidity, including, but not limited to, inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (\"FRBSF\"), as well as to capital markets.\nWe cannot assure you that access to such capital and liquidity will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other financial institutions.\nFinancial institutions that deal with each other are interconnected as a result of trading, investment, liquidity management, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Within the financial services industry, loss of public confidence, including through default by any one institution, could lead to liquidity challenges or to defaults by other institutions. Concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, banks and exchanges we interact with on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the Federal Home Loan Banks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe primary source of the holding company's liquidity from which, among other things, we pay dividends is the receipt of dividends from the Bank.\nThe holding company, PacWest, is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the FRB, the FDIC and/or the DBO could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice, or that such regulatory authority may impose restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends as a condition to the Bank's participation in any stabilization program. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the holding company, it is likely that we, in turn, would have to stop paying dividends on our common stock and may have difficulty meeting our other financial obligations, including payments in respect of any outstanding indebtedness or trust preferred securities. Since the Bank had a retained deficit of $609 million at December 31, 2015, for the foreseeable future, any further cash dividends from the Bank to the Company will continue to require DBO and FDIC approval. The inability of the Bank to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends on common stock.\nOur stockholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the restrictions set forth in Delaware law, by our federal regulator, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures. Notification to the FRB is also required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our stockholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. We may not pay a dividend if the FRB objects or until such time as we receive approval from the FRB or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or regulation or actions taken by our regulators, or as a result of our participation in any future specific government stabilization programs, now or in the future, from paying dividends to our stockholders. We cannot assure you that we will continue paying dividends on our common stock at current levels or at all. A reduction or discontinuance of dividends on our common stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Legal Risk\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC, DBO and CFPB. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments we make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, consumer disclosures on the products and services we offer, the amount of reserves we must hold against our customers' deposits, the types of deposits we may accept and the rates we may pay on such deposits, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, restrictions on dividends and establishment of new offices by the Bank. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, including certain acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require will be obtained, or obtained without conditions, either in a timely manner or at all. Our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute unsafe or unsound banking practice. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of the extensive federal and state regulations we are subject to, our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in orders from our regulators, civil monetary penalties, or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly revised and expanded the rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority of federal bank regulators and created the CFPB, which is now one of our regulators. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, are undergoing continuous review and change frequently. The ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Because our business is highly regulated, compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Also, participation in any future specific government stabilization programs may subject us to additional restrictions. There can be no assurance that laws, rules and regulations will not be proposed or adopted in the future, which could (i) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (ii) restrict our ability to originate, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iii) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (iv) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has had and will continue to have material implications for us and the entire financial services industry. Among other things it has, had, or will or potentially could have the following effects:\n\u2022\ntogether with regulations implementing Basel III reforms, affect the levels of capital and liquidity with which we must operate and how we plan capital and liquidity levels;\n\u2022\nsubject us to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees to the FDIC;\n\u2022\nsubject us to annual stress tests;\n\u2022\nimpact our ability to invest in certain types of entities or engage in certain activities;\n\u2022\nrestrict the nature of our incentive compensation programs for executive officers;\n\u2022\nsubject us to the supervision of the CFPB, with its broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws; and\n\u2022\nsubject us to new and different litigation and regulatory enforcement risks.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on us, our business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time, and may not be known for a number of years. Some aspects of Dodd-Frank continue to be subject to rulemaking and many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years, or may be subject to interpretation or clarification, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us or across the industry. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them may adversely affect us and our financial performance. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary or desired changes, and could therefore also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn October 2012, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB and FDIC published final rules regarding company-run stress testing. As a result of these final rules we invest a significant amount of time and resources into conducting an annual company-run stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses under various stress scenarios provided by our regulators. Our stress test results are considered by the FRB and FDIC in evaluating our capital adequacy and could have a negative impact on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases.\nThe Volcker Rule prohibits us from, among other things, (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for our own accounts, and (ii) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also requires us to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which we engage in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include making regular reports about those activities to regulators. We established our internal compliance program prior to the initial conformance period. The conformance period for certain legacy investments and relationships ends July 21, 2016. The FRB has indicated that it intends to extend this conformance deadline to July 2017. In addition, the FRB may extend the conformance deadline for up to an additional five years (until July 2022) for investments that are considered illiquid. Under the Volcker Rule, we are required to wind-down, transfer, divest or otherwise ensure the termination or expiration of any prohibited interests prior to the end of our applicable conformance period. While we intend to seek the maximum extensions available to us, there is no assurance that we will be granted any of these extensions, and thus, we may be required to divest our prohibited interests within a short period of time and/or at possibly distressed prices. Our equity investments subject to the Volcker Rule had an aggregate carrying value of $1.9 million at December 31, 2015.\nBecause many of the effects of the Volcker Rule may become apparent only over the next several years as the federal financial regulatory agencies apply the rules in practice, the precise financial impact of the rule on us, our customers, or the financial industry more generally cannot currently be determined. The actual impact from the Volcker Rule will be dependent on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain regulatory extensions, our ability to sell the investments, our carrying value at the time of any sale, the actual sales price realized, the timing of such sales, and any additional regulatory guidance or interpretations of the Volcker Rule.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nWe are subject to Basel III that is being phased-in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019. As a result of Basel III, we will be required to satisfy additional and more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than we have in the past. Additionally, stress testing requirements may have the effect of requiring us to comply with certain aspects of the requirements of Basel III, or potentially even greater capital requirements, sooner than expected. While we expect to meet the requirements of Basel III, inclusive of the phased-in capital conservation buffer, these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases.\nThe change of control rules under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to use net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes to reduce future tax payments or our willingness to issue equity.\nPacWest acquired Square 1 on October 6, 2015. As merger consideration, we issued approximately 18.1 million shares of common stock to the Square 1 shareholders. The issuance of these shares caused us to experience an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Consequently, the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits and other tax attributes are subject to an annual limitation. We estimate that such annual limitation will not impose additional restrictions on our usage of Square 1's acquired existing tax attributes.\nGenerally, upon a change in ownership of more than 50% of our capital stock over a three-year period as measured under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes after the ownership change generally would be limited. The annual limit would generally equal the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the relevant taxable entity's capital stock immediately before the ownership change. These change of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly\n5% or more (the \"5-Percent Shareholders\") of a company's outstanding stock, including certain public groups of stockholders as set forth under Section 382, and those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions.\nIn May 2015, our stockholders ratified a tax benefit preservation plan (the \"Tax Plan\") which was designed to preserve our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes of the Company. The Tax Plan is intended to discourage persons from becoming 5-Percent Shareholders and existing 5-Percent Shareholders from increasing their beneficial ownership of shares.\nAlthough the Tax Plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us, there can be no assurance that such restrictions would prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change and thus no assurance can be given as to whether we could utilize the net operating losses to offset future taxable income. Additionally, because the Tax Plan may have the effect of restricting a stockholder's ability to dispose of or acquire the common stock of the Company, the liquidity and market value of our common stock might suffer.\nThe determination of whether an ownership change occurs is complex and not entirely within our control. No assurance can be given as to whether we will undergo another ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the future.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in federal and state tax laws, interpretation of existing laws and examinations and challenges by taxing authorities.\nOur financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws. Given the current economic and political environment, and ongoing budgetary pressures, the enactment of new federal or state tax legislation may occur. The enactment of such legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing law, including provisions impacting income tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expenses, and credits, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn the normal course of business, we are routinely subjected to examinations and audits from federal and state taxing authorities regarding tax positions taken by us and the determination of the amount of tax due. These examinations may relate to income, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property, sales and use, or other tax returns filed, or not filed, by us. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the amount of taxes due, and may result in the imposition of penalties and interest. If any such challenges are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation which could adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, or cause us significant reputational harm.\nWe and certain of our directors, officers and subsidiaries may be involved, from time to time, in litigation pertaining to our business activities. If such claims and legal actions, whether founded or unfounded, are not resolved in a favorable manner to us they may result in significant financial liability. Although we establish accruals for legal matters when and as required by generally accepted accounting principles and certain expenses and liabilities in connection with such matters may be covered by insurance, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued and/or insured. Substantial legal liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nRisk of the Competitive Environment in which We Operate\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct our banking operations through branches located throughout California. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced deposits or less favorable deposit terms. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the same banking services that we offer. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, non-bank specialty lenders, insurance companies, private investment funds, investment banks, and other financial intermediaries. While there are a limited number of direct competitors in the venture banking market, some of our competitors have long-standing relationships with venture firms and the companies that are funded by such firms. The market for our Square 1 Bank Division is extremely competitive and several of our competitors have significantly greater resources, established customer bases, more locations and longer operating histories.\nAdditionally, the financial services industry has become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued banking consolidation. Banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger or no lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain deposits, and the range and quality of products and services provided, including new technology driven products and services. Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. We also face competition from financial intermediaries that have opened production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas. Should competition in the financial services industry intensify, our ability to market our products and services may be adversely affected. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to grow or maintain the levels of our loans and deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result.\nCompetition from financial institutions seeking to maintain adequate liquidity places upward pressure on the rates paid on certain deposit accounts relative to the level of market interest rates during times of both decreasing and increasing market liquidity. To maintain adequate levels of liquidity, without exhausting secondary sources of liquidity, we may incur increased deposit costs.\nOur ability to maintain, attract and retain customer relationships is highly dependent on our reputation.\nOur customers expect us to deliver superior, personalized financial services with the highest standards of ethics, performance, professionalism and compliance. Damage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers in our ability to provide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described herein, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, customer and other third-party fraud, record-keeping, technology-related issues including but not limited to cyber fraud, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to successfully prevent third parties from infringing on our brands and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property. Defense of our reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, various rating services publish unsolicited ratings of the financial performance and relative financial health of many banks, including Pacific Western, based on publicly available data. As these ratings are publicly available, a decline in the Bank's ratings from these agencies may damage our reputation and result in deposit outflows or the inability of the Bank to raise deposits in the secondary market as broker-dealers and depositors may use such ratings in deciding where to deposit their funds.\nRisks Related to Risk Management\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business and we are in the process of converting to a new core processing system.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, we depend on internal and outsourced technology to support all aspects of our business operations. We expect to convert from the core processing system that is used to manage customer accounts to a processing system offered by another software vendor with the initial phase occurring during the second quarter of 2016. Interruption or failure of these systems creates a risk of business loss as a result of adverse customer experiences and possible diminishing of our reputation, damage claims or civil fines. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or to successfully convert to a new core processing system could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions may subject us to unknown risks.\nCertain events may arise after the date of an acquisition, or we may learn of certain facts, events or circumstances after the closing of an acquisition, that may affect our financial condition or performance or subject us to risk of loss. These events include, but are not limited to: litigation resulting from circumstances occurring at the acquired entity prior to the date of acquisition; loan downgrades and credit loss provisions resulting from underwriting of certain acquired loans determined not to meet our credit standards; personnel changes that cause instability within a department; delays in implementing new policies or procedures or the failure to apply new policies or procedures; and other events relating to the performance of our business. Acquisitions involve inherent uncertainty and we cannot determine all potential events, facts and circumstances that could result in loss or increased costs or give assurances that our due diligence or mitigation efforts will be sufficient to protect against any such loss or increased costs.\nOur ability to execute strategic activities successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may include our success in integrating the operations, services, products, personnel and systems of an acquired company into our business, operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business, retaining key employees, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting expectations and otherwise realizing the undertaking's anticipated benefits. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic initiatives may divert resources or management's attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. If we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, regulatory relationships and growth prospects. In addition, if we determined that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill was impaired, an impairment of goodwill charge to earnings would be recognized. To the extent we issue capital stock in connection with additional transactions, these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on book value, earnings per share and share ownership.\nOur information and customer systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nOur communications, information technology and customer systems supporting our operations are important to our efficiency and vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers, to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fires, other natural disasters and pandemics, power or telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or wars or other catastrophic events, or other physical failures. Risk management programs are expensive to maintain and will not protect us from all risks associated with maintaining the security of customer information, proprietary data, external and internal intrusions, disaster recovery and failures in the controls used by vendors. Any damage or failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches, could result in loss of or delay in access to customer information and/or failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information and customer systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our communications, information, technology and customer systems could result in liability to clients or loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, or results of operations. In addition, recovery from any of the mentioned areas of concern may be costly in terms of employee attention and out-of-pocket expenses.\nWe maintain insurance policies that we believe provide appropriate coverage at a reasonable cost for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot provide assurance that these policies will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing an attack.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on certain third parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, on-line banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we select and monitor the performance of third parties carefully, we do not control their actions. The failure of a third-party to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements as a result of changes in the third party\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Replacing these third parties could also create significant delays and expense.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance monitoring activities and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation and financial condition. In addition, if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and potentially subject us to litigation. Any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or restatement of our financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and financial condition.\nA natural disaster could harm the Company's business.\nThe nature and level of natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. These natural disasters could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling the flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. California, in which a substantial portion of our business is located and a substantial portion of our loan collateral is located, is susceptible to natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts and wild fires, and is currently in the midst of an ongoing drought. Such natural disasters could negatively impact our business operations, the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interrupt our borrowers' abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit losses. We have implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery program which is reviewed and updated no less often than annually. There is no assurance that our business continuity and disaster recovery program can adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.\nRisk from Accounting Estimates\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nTo comply with generally accepted accounting principles, management must exercise judgment in selecting, determining, and applying accounting methods, assumptions, and estimates. Management makes various estimates and judgments about the collectability of acquired loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. If the actual performance of the acquired loans and/or the value of the collateral differs materially from management's estimates, any resulting losses or increased credit loss provisions could have a negative effect on our operating results.", "PERMNO": 88343, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PACW"}
