RISK FACTORS\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors identified elsewhere in this Report, the most significant risk factors affecting our business include those set forth below. The below description of risk factors is not exhaustive, and readers should not consider the description of such risk factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect us.\nMarket, Interest Rate, Credit and Liquidity Risk\nEconomic and general market conditions may adversely affect our business.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic market, political uncertainty and social conditions, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, political risks and the sustainability of economic growth. Deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our business segments, the level of credit risk we have assumed, our capital levels and liquidity, and our results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are also affected by domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy. Central bank actions can affect the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as investment securities and MSRs, and their policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could have an adverse impact on our capital requirements and the costs of running our business.\nFurther, any deterioration in the mortgage market may also reduce the number of new mortgages that we originate, increase the costs of servicing mortgages without a corresponding increase in servicing fees or adversely affect our ability to sell mortgage loans originated by us. Any such event could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage origination business is subject to the cyclical and seasonal trends of the real estate market. Cyclicality in our industry could lead to periods of strong growth in the mortgage and real estate markets followed by periods of sharp declines and losses in such markets. One of the primary influences on our mortgage business is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans in our market areas, which is affected by prevailing interest rates. If we are unable to respond to the cyclicality of our industry by appropriately adjusting our operations, headcount and overhead, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, seasonal trends have historically reflected the general patterns of residential and commercial real estate sales, which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons. Furthermore, Basel III provides for a countercyclical capital buffer to induce banking organizations to hold capital in excess of regulatory minimums.\nIncreases in interest rates could lead to lower mortgage origination volume, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2016, approximately 55 percent of our revenue was derived from the origination of residential mortgages. The residential real estate mortgage lending business is sensitive to interest rates. Lower interest rates generally increase the volume of mortgage originations, while higher interest rates generally cause that volume to decrease. Therefore, our mortgage performance is typically correlated to fluctuations in interest rates. Historically, mortgage origination volumes and sales for the Bank and for other financial institutions have risen and fallen in response to these and other factors. An increase in interest rates would change these conditions and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. From January through October 2016, average 10 year treasury rates, on which we base our pricing of our 30 year mortgages, remained low at 1.74 percent, 40 basis points lower than average rates experienced throughout 2015 which drove favorable mortgage loan originations, particularly refinancing activity. From November through December 2016, average 10 year treasury rates increased 58 basis points to 2.32 percent which had a negative impact on our fallout adjusted mortgage origination rate lock volume in the fourth quarter.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations including our net interest margin, mortgage related assets, and investment portfolio.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. While we have modeled rising interest rate scenarios and such scenarios result in an increase in our net interest income, our deposits and interest-bearing liabilities may reprice more quickly than modeled, thus resulting in a decrease in our net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates may affect the average life of our mortgage loans and mortgage related securities. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in unscheduled prepayments of our mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their own borrowing costs. As prepayment speeds on mortgage-related securities increase, any premium amortization would increase on a prospective basis. Any immediate adjustments required under the application of the interest method of income recognition may also result in lower net interest income. On the other hand, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate mortgage loans.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the fair value of our LHFS, LHFI and investment securities. Generally, the value of our investment securities, which are predominantly fixed-rate, fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Decreases in the fair value of our investment securities, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity or our earnings if the decrease in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary.\nThe fair value of our MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility. Decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in actual repayments and the probability of repayments which have a negative impact on MSR fair value. An increase in market implied interest rate volatility has a negative impact on our MSR assets and also lowers their fair value.\nWe manage MSRs using certain derivative strategies which may be ineffective.\nWe invest in MSRs to support mortgage strategies and to deploy capital at acceptable returns. Our MSRs are sensitive to market implied interest rate volatility and are highly susceptible to prepayment risk, basis risk, and changes in the shape of the yield curve, among other factors. We utilize derivatives and other fair value assets as part of our overall hedging strategy to manage the impact of changes in the fair value of the MSRs, but these risk management strategies do not completely eliminate risk. In addition, our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding assets and general market factors, many of which are outside of our control. One or more of these assumptions or projections may prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, and as a result we may incur losses that would adversely impact earnings.\nAt December 31, 2016, our MSR was $335 million of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. We may be unable to effectively manage our MSR concentration risk which could impact our Common Equity Tier 1(CET1) under Basel III, which when fully phased-in will require any MSR balance exceeding 10 percent of our CET1 to be deducted from capital.\nAs of January 1, 2015, we are subject to new rules relating to capital standards requirements, including requirements contemplated by Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III. Basel III established a new qualifying criteria for regulatory capital, including new limitations on the amount of deferred tax assets and MSRs that may be held without significantly higher capital requirements. Basel III limits that amount of MSRs and deferred tax assets to 10 percent of CET1, individually, and 15 percent of CET1, in the aggregate. While we have established a plan to reduce these assets before the Basel III full implementation date of March 31, 2018 and are taking other actions to reduce our book balance by that date, no assurances can be given that we will be able to do so, or that we will be successful in selling these assets at their current fair value. If implemented today, we would experience another 201 basis points reduction in Tier 1 Capital (to risk weighted assets) and 105 basis points reduction in the leverage ratio (Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average assets) from those levels at December 31, 2016. For further information, see Note 20 - Regulatory Matters.\nAt December 31, 2016 our ALLL was $142 million, covering 2.4 percent of total loans held-for-investment. Our estimate of the inherent losses is imperfect, the portfolio is relatively new and we are using underwriting standards which have not been in place for a long period of time.\nOur estimate of the allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2016. If this level were insufficient, future provisions for credit losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Our ALLL is based on prior experience as well as an evaluation of the risks incurred in the current portfolio. The determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently subjective process that requires significant management judgment, including estimates of loss and the loss emergence period. We make various assumptions, estimates and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio including but not limited to the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of real estate or other collateral backing the repayment of loans. New information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, failure of borrowers and guarantors to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the ALLL. Moreover, our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our ALLL. Our regulators, who have access to broader industry data that we do not have, may recommend or require us to change our ALLL, based on their judgment, which may be different from that of our management or other regulators. Any increase in our loan losses would have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nConcentration of loans held-for-investment in certain geographic locations and portfolios may increase risk.\nOur mortgage loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in certain states, including California, Michigan, Florida, Washington and Texas, which is approximately 65 percent of the portfolio. In addition, approximately 75 percent of our commercial real estate loans are in Michigan or are repayable by borrowers who have significant operations in Michigan. This concentration has made, and will continue to make, our loan portfolio particularly susceptible to downturns in the general economy and the real estate and mortgage markets. Adverse conditions beyond our control, including unemployment, inflation, recession, natural disasters, declining property values, municipal bankruptcies and other factors in these markets could increase default rates in our loan portfolio and could reduce our ability to generate new loans and otherwise negatively affect our financial results.\nIn 2016, we continued to grow our portfolio of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, which generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate loans due to the more complex nature of underwriting associated with commercial loans. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans and collateral may not offset the principal balance at default. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one commercial loan outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential real estate loan.\nLiquidity is essential to our business and liquidity risk is inherent in our operations, which could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nWe require substantial liquidity to repay our customers' deposits, fulfill loan demands, meet debt obligations as they come due, and fund our operations under both normal operating environments and unforeseen circumstances causing liquidity\nstress. Our access to liquidity could be impaired by our inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of deposits. Our access to external sources of financing, including deposits, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent on various factors including regulatory restrictions. A number of factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive or unavailable on any terms, including, but not limited to, declining financial results and losses, material changes to operating margins, financial leverage on an absolute basis or relative to peers, changes within the organization, specific events that impact our financial condition or reputation, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting assets, the corporate and regulatory structure, balance sheet and capital structure, geographic and business diversification, interest rate fluctuations, market share and competitive position, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax environments governing funding transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. The material deterioration in any one or a combination of these factors could result in a downgrade of our credit or servicer standing with counterparties or a decline in our reputation within the marketplace, and could result in higher cash outflows requiring additional access to liquidity, having a limited ability to borrow funds, maintain or increase deposits (including custodial deposits for our agency servicing portfolio) or to raise capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur ability to make mortgage loans and fund our investments and operations depends largely on our ability to secure funds on terms acceptable to us. Our primary sources of funds to meet our financing needs include loan sales, deposits, which include custodial accounts from our servicing portfolio, public funds, and capital-raising activities. Our company controlled deposits are considered stable sources of funding in our stress testing model. If we are unable to maintain any of these financing arrangements, are restricted from accessing certain funding sources by our regulators, are unable to arrange for new financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, or if we default on any of the covenants imposed upon us by our borrowing facilities, then we may have to reduce the number of mortgage loans we are able to originate for sale in the secondary market or for our own investment or take other actions that could have other negative effects on our operations. A prolonged significant reduction in loan originations that occurs as a result could adversely impact our earnings, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. There is no guarantee that we will be able to renew or maintain our financing arrangements or deposits or that we will be able to adequately access capital markets when or if a need for additional capital arises.\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our financial assets and financial liabilities. Different assumptions and estimates could result in significant declines or increases in valuation.\nA total of $5.2 billion of assets and $118 million of liabilities are carried on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value, including our LHFS, AFS investment securities, MSRs, derivatives, certain LHFI, and the DOJ settlement liability. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices when available. In certain cases, observable market prices and data may not be readily available or their availability may be diminished due to market conditions. In such cases, we use internally developed financial models that utilize observable market data inputs as well as asset specific collateral data included in market observable data to estimate the fair value of certain of these assets and liabilities. These valuation models rely to some degree on management's assumptions, estimates and judgment, which are inherently uncertain. We cannot be certain that the models or the underlying assumptions will prove to be predictive and remain so over time, and therefore, actual results may differ from our models and assumptions. Different assumptions could result in significant differences in valuation, which in turn could result in significant changes in the dollar amount of assets or liabilities we report on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans or securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are inaccurate, we may experience material losses.\nWe are a holding company and are, therefore, dependent on the Bank for funding of obligations.\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of the Bank and a limited amount of cash, our ability to make payments for certain services we purchase from the Bank and to service our debt, including interest payments on our senior notes and junior subordinated debentures depends upon available cash on hand and the receipt of dividends from the Bank on such capital stock. The holding company had cash and cash equivalents of $70 million at December 31, 2016. The declaration and payment of dividends by the Bank on all classes of its capital stock is subject to the discretion of the Bank's board of directors and to applicable regulatory and legal limitations. If the Bank does not make dividend payments to us, we may not be able to service our debt which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory Risk\nThe Holding Company and the Bank remain subject to the restrictions and conditions of the Supervisory Agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Consent Order with the CFPB, respectively. Failure to comply with the Supervisory Agreement could result in further enforcement action against us.\nThere is no guarantee that the Bank will be able to fully comply with the Consent Order. In the event that we are in material non-compliance with the terms of the Consent Order, the CFPB has the authority to subject the Bank to additional corrective actions. Moreover, they could initiate further enforcement actions against the Bank, seek an injunction requiring the Bank and its officers and directors to comply with the Consent Order and seek civil money penalties against us and our officers and directors. Any failure by the Bank to comply with the terms of the Consent Order or additional actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Bank\u2019s competitors may not be subject to similar actions, which could limit our ability to compete effectively. These corrective actions could negatively impact the Bank's operations and financial performance. For further information on Consent Order see Item 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision.\nThe Supervisory Agreement, requires that we take certain actions to address issues identified by the OTS. The Supervisory Agreement is enforced by the Federal Reserve as the successor regulator to the OTS with respect to savings and loan holding companies. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to submit a capital plan; receive written non-objection before declaring or paying any dividend or other capital distribution from the Holding Company, incurring or renewing any debt at the Holding Company and engaging in affiliate transactions (with limited exceptions); comply with applicable regulatory requirements before making certain severance and indemnification payments; and provide notice prior to changes in directors and certain executive officers or entering into, renewing, extending or revising compensation or benefits agreements of such directors or executive officers, with such changes being subject to Federal Reserve approval. While we believe that we have taken all action necessary to comply with the requirements of the Supervisory Agreement, failure to comply with the Supervisory Agreement in the time frames provided, or at all, could result in additional enforcement orders or penalties, which could include further restrictions on us, assessment of civil money penalties on us, as well as our directors, officers and other affiliated parties and removal of one or more officers and/or directors. Any failure by us to comply with the terms of the Supervisory Agreement or additional actions by the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our competitors may not be subject to similar actions, which could limit our ability to compete effectively. For further information on Supervisory Agreement see Item 1. Business - Regulation and Supervision.\nExpanded regulatory oversight over our business could significantly increase our risks and costs associated with complying with current and future regulations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs noted in Item 1 - Business - Regulation and Supervision, we are subject to a wide variety of banking, consumer protection and securities laws, regulations and supervisory expectations and numerous regulatory and enforcement authorities. As a result of and in addition to new legislation aimed at regulatory reform, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, and the increased capital requirements introduced by the Basel III final rules, the regulatory agencies generally are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating financial institutions and financial products and services over which they exercise their respective supervisory authorities. We, the Bank, and our products and services all remain subject to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations. We may face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements in the foreseeable future.\nThe Collins Amendment to Dodd-Frank Act establishes minimum Tier 1 leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and non-bank financial companies that are supervised by the Federal Reserve. The minimum Tier 1 leverage and risk-based capital requirements are determined by the minimum ratios established by the federal banking agencies that apply to insured depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations. The amendment states that certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, may be included in Tier 1 capital for bank holding companies with total assets below $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. As we were below $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, the trust preferred securities will be included as Tier 1 capital while they are outstanding, subject to certain future limitations. If a depository institution holding company under $15 billion acquires a depository institution holding company and the resulting organization has total consolidated assets of $15 billion or more at the end of the quarter in which the transaction occurred, the resulting organization may no longer include such certain hybrid securities in Tier 1 capital.\nAs a result of increasing scrutiny and regulation of the banking industry and consumer practices, we may face a greater number or wider scope of examinations, investigations, enforcement actions and litigation, thereby increasing our costs associated with responding to or defending such actions, as well as potentially resulting in costs associated with fines, penalties, settlements or judgments. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our businesses, and any required changes resulting from these developments, could reduce our revenue, limit the products or services that we offer or increase the costs thereof, impose additional compliance costs, harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. Some of these laws may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may seek to pursue to enforce these laws and regulations.\nBoth the OCC and the FDIC may take regulatory enforcement actions against any of their regulated institutions that do not operate in accordance with applicable regulations, policies and directives. Proceedings may be instituted against any banking institution, or any \"institution-affiliated party,\" such as a director, officer, employee, agent or controlling person, who engages in unsafe and unsound practices, including violations of applicable laws and regulations. The OCC has authority under various circumstances to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured institution that it regulates, to issue cease and desist orders, to obtain injunctions restraining or prohibiting unsafe or unsound practices, to revalue assets and to require the establishment of reserves. The FDIC has additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts, after notice and hearing, upon a finding that the insured institution is or has engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice that has not been corrected, is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, or order of, or condition imposed by, the FDIC. In addition, the Federal Reserve may take regulatory enforcement actions against us, and the CFPB may also have the authority to take regulatory enforcement actions against us or the Bank.\nFinancial services reform legislation has resulted in, among other things, numerous restrictions and requirements which could negatively impact our business and increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act and its' implemented regulations have increased and may continue to increase our operating and compliance costs and our interest expense.\nThe CFPB has broad and unique rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers, including prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service including regulations related to the origination and servicing of residential mortgages. The CFPB has finalized significant rules and guidance that impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage and continues to revise these rules and propose new rules. The Bank is subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervisory, examination and enforcement authority with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. As a result, we could incur increased costs, potential litigation or be materially limited or restricted in our business, product offerings or services in the future.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending practices on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB, and other agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in class action litigation. A successful challenge to the Bank's performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact the Bank's rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions or penalties, which could negatively impact the Bank's reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nBank regulators have increased their focus on consumer compliance and, as a result, those portions of our lending operations which most directly deal with consumers, in particular our mortgage operations and consumer lending, pose particular challenges. While we are not aware of any material issues with our compliance, mortgage and consumer lending practices raise compliance risks. Despite the supervision and oversight we exercise in these areas, failure to comply with these regulations could result in the Bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers or other imposed penalties.\nCompliance obligations have exposed us and will continue to expose us to additional noncompliance risk and could divert management\u2019s focus from our business operations. Furthermore, the combined effect of numerous rulemakings by multiple governmental agencies and regulators, and the potential conflicts or inconsistencies among such rules, present challenges and risks to our business and operations.\nWe are highly dependent on the Agencies to sell mortgage loans and any changes in these entities or their current roles could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell approximately 70 percent of our mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship and a path forward to emerge from conservatorship is unclear. These roles could be reduced, modified or eliminated and the nature of their guarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements.\nThe elimination or modification of the traditional roles of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these agencies, any significant adverse change in the level of activity of these agencies in the primary or secondary mortgage markets or in the underwriting criteria of these agencies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the servicing or origination guidelines required by the Agencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to follow specific guidelines that impact the way that we service and originate Agency loans, including guidelines with respect to credit standards for mortgage loans, our staffing levels and other servicing practices, the servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge, our modification standards and procedures and the amount of non-reimbursable advances.\nWe cannot negotiate these terms with the Agencies and they are subject to change at any time. A significant change in these guidelines that has the effect of decreasing the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage services could decrease our revenues or increase our costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the insurance provided by the FHA could also have broad adverse market implications. The fees that we are required to pay to the Agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon having FDIC insurance to raise deposit funding at reasonable rates. Increases in deposit insurance premiums and special FDIC assessments will adversely affect our earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to substantially revise its regulations for determining the amount of an institution's deposit insurance premiums. The FDIC has defined the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as average consolidated total assets during the assessment period, minus average tangible equity. Our assessment rate is determined by use of a scorecard that combines a financial institution's CAMELS ratings with certain other financial information. The FDIC may determine that we present a higher risk to the DIF than other banks due to certain factors. These factors include significant risks relating to interest rates, loan portfolio and geographic concentration, concentration of high credit risk loans, increased loan losses, regulatory compliance (including under existing Supervisory Agreement), existing and future litigation and other factors. As a result, we could be subject to higher deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future that could adversely affect our earnings. The Bank\u2019s deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future also may be higher than competing banks may be required to pay. Our total exposure related to uninsured deposits over $250,000 was approximately $2 billion as of December 31, 2016. These balances could experience a higher propensity to reprice should rates rise or the Bank's financial condition deteriorate.\nOperational Risk\nA failure of our information technology systems, or those of our key third party vendors or service providers, could cause operational losses and damage our reputation.\nOur businesses are increasingly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions and data. If our internal financial, accounting, or other information technology systems fail, we may be unable to conduct business for a period of time, which may impact our financial results if that interruption is sustained. In addition, our reputation with our customers or counterparties may suffer, which could have a further, long-term impact on our financial results.\nAlso, because we conduct part of our business over the Internet and outsource a significant number of our critical functions to third parties, our operations depend on our third-party service providers to maintain and operate their own technology systems. To the extent these third parties\u2019 systems fail, we may be unable to conduct business or provide certain services, and we may face financial and reputational losses as a result.\nWe collect, store and transfer our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information, and any compromise to the security of that information may have meaningful consequences for us.\nData breaches are of a particular concern relative to the processing of consumer transactions, such as the servicing or subservicing of loans. Our businesses receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data. There are myriad federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data.\nWe have policies and processes in place that are intended to meet the requirements of those laws, including security systems in place to prevent unauthorized access to that information. Nevertheless, those processes and systems may be inadequate. Also, to the extent we rely upon third parties to handle personally identifiable data on our behalf, we may be responsible if such data is compromised while in the custody and control of those third parties.\nPrivacy laws are still evolving and many state and local jurisdictions have laws that differ from federal law. At times, we may also be governed by privacy laws outside of the U.S., with which we are less familiar. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state, local or international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data, those events could damage the reputation of our business, and discourage potential users from utilizing our products and services. In addition, we may have to bear the cost of mitigating identity theft concerns, and may be subject to fines or legal proceedings by governmental agencies or consumers. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions.\nWe act as servicer and subservicer for mortgage loans owned by third parties, which is approximately 10 percent of our revenue and results in approximately $1.6 billion of our average company controlled deposits. In such capacities for those loans, we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income.\nFor certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit or other losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims for which we did not satisfy our obligations, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to noninterest income or increase to noninterest expense. We may incur significant costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold by us, we make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the Agencies, about the mortgage loans, and the manner in which they were originated. We have made, and will continue to make, such representations and warranties in connection with the sale of loans. Whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower or we may be required to pay fees. We also are subject to litigation relating to these representations and warranties and the costs of such litigation may be significant. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies we have available against the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us. In addition, we also face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that\notherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims, the liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected.\nOur representation and warranty reserve for losses at December 31, 2016 is $27 million. This may not be adequate to cover losses for loans that we have sold or securitized into the secondary market which we may be subsequently required to repurchase, pay fines or fees, or indemnify purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties. The repurchase demand pipeline was $6 million at December 31, 2016. The original unpaid principal balance of 2009 and later vintage loans sold to the Agencies through December 31, 2016 was $183 million.\nIn addition, our regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our representation and warranty reserve for losses. Our regulators, based on their judgment, may recommend or require us to increase our reserve. Any increase in our loan losses could have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nWe utilize third party mortgage originators which subjects us to strategic, reputation, compliance and operational risk.\nApproximately 94 percent of our residential first mortgage volume depends upon the use of third party mortgage originators, i.e. mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders, who are not our employees. These third parties originate mortgages and provide services to many different banks and other entities. Accordingly, they may have relationships with or loyalties to such banks and other parties that are different from those they have with or to us. Failure to maintain good relations with such third party mortgage originators could have a negative impact on our market share which would negatively impact our net income.\nWe rely on third party mortgage originators to originate and document the mortgage loans we purchase. While we perform due diligence on the mortgage companies with whom we do business and review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance, we have less control over these originators than employees of the Bank.\nDue to increasing regulatory scrutiny, our third party mortgage originators could choose or be required to either reduce the scope of their business or exit the mortgage origination business altogether. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule issued by the CFPB establishes comprehensive mortgage disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The rule requires certain disclosures are provided to consumers in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan. The rule also mandates the use of specific disclosure forms, timing of communicating information to borrowers and certain record keeping requirements. The increased administrative burden and the system requirements associated with complying with these rules could lead to a decrease in our mortgage volume.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending practices on financial institutions. This regulation applies to lending operations which deal directly with consumer lending. Mortgage and consumer lending practices raise compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and consumer lending regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies, and the relatively independent and diverse operating channels in which loans are originated. We, and our brokers, are required to apply fair lending and ensure lending practices do not result in a disparate impact to borrowers across various locations. Failure to comply with these regulations, by us or our brokers, could result in the Bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers or other imposed penalties.\nOur ability to control the third party mortgage originators could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, these arrangements with third party mortgage originators and the fees payable by us to such third parties could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny and restrictions in the future.\nWe may be subject to corporate tax reform which could impact our net income and effective tax rate.\nCongress is evaluating Tax Reform and certain proposals, such as a reduction in the corporate tax rate, which could have a material impact on the Company. If a reduction in rate is enacted we would expect to record a significant charge to expense through our tax provision for the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset. Going forward the reduction in rate may have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nMP Thrift, an entity managed and controlled by MatlinPatterson, owns 62.6 percent of our common stock and has significant influence over us, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, whether or not such decisions are in the best interests of other stockholders.\nMP Thrift owns a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock and as a result, has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and also the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or the stockholders regardless of whether or not other members of our board of directors or stockholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. So long as MP Thrift continues to hold a majority of our outstanding common stock, it will have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors and other matters being voted on, and continue to exert significant influence over us. Furthermore, MP Thrift may have interests that could diverge from the interests of other stockholders, and may use its control to make decisions that adversely affect the interest of other common stockholders and other holders of our debt or other equity instruments.\nAdditionally, our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change\" as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An ownership change occurs if, immediately after any owner shift involving a 5 percent shareholder or any equity structure shift (1) the percentage of the stock of the loss corporation, owned by one or more 5 percent shareholders has increased by more than 50 percentage points, over (2) the lowest percentage of stock of the loss corporation owned by such shareholders. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation\u2019s net operating losses, certain recognized built-in losses, and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs. As we have a controlling stockholder, any stock offering in isolation or when combined with other ownership changes, could cause us to experience an ownership change and trigger these restrictions.\nWe are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings.\nAt any given time, we are defending ourselves against a number of legal and regulatory investigations and proceedings. Proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, business improvement orders, consent orders, supervisory agreements, restrictions on our business activities or other results adverse to us, which could materially and negatively affect our businesses. If such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations. We have been, and may continue to be in the future, subject to stockholder derivative actions, which could seek significant damages or other relief. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop, making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations relating to our business and operations.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question. As a result, our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies.\nFor further information regarding the unpredictability of legal proceedings and description regarding our pending legal proceedings see, Note 21 - Legal Proceedings, Contingencies and Commitments.\nOther Risk Factors\nThe above description of risk factors is not exhaustive. Other risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Other factors that could also cause results to differ from our expectations may not be described herein or in any such report or document. Each of these factors could by itself, or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 84734, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "FBC"}
