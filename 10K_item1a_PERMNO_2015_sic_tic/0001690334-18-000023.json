RISK FACTORS\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected by numerous risks. Carefully consider the risks described below, which represent some of the more material risk factors that affect the Company, as well as the other information that has been provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below include all known material risks faced by the Company. Additional risks not presently known may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations.\nRisk Factors Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Industry\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuating prices of oil and decreased demand for oil.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s offshore support services is impacted by the comparative price for exploring, developing, and producing oil and natural gas and by the corresponding supply and demand for oil and natural gas, both globally and regionally. Among other factors, the increased supply of oil and natural gas from the development of new oil and natural gas supply sources and technologies to improve recovery from current sources, particularly shale, have reduced the price of oil and natural gas as well as demand and prices charged for offshore support services globally. The advent of electric cars, development of alternative sources of energy to hydrocarbons, such as solar and wind power, could also diminish the demand for oil and natural gas. Such diminution of demand could place continued or additional pressure on the price of oil and therefore demand for the Company\u2019s services, as developing offshore oil fields, particularly in deep waters, is one of the most expensive sources of hydrocarbons. Other factors that influence the supply and demand and the relative price of oil include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, political instability, conflicts, civil unrest, the worldwide political and military environment, acts of terrorism, foreign exchange rates, economic conditions and actions by major oil-producing countries. The price of oil and the relative cost to extract, proximity to market and political imperatives of countries with offshore deposits affect the willingness to commit investment for contract drilling rigs and offshore support vessels used for offshore exploration, field development and production activities, which in turn affects the Company\u2019s results of operations. Prolonged periods of low oil and natural gas prices or rising costs result in lower demand for the Company\u2019s services and can give rise to impairments of the Company\u2019s assets.\nBeginning in the second half of 2014 and through the beginning of 2016, the price of oil dropped significantly, from a high of $107 per barrel during 2014 to a thirteen-year low of less than $27 per barrel in February 2016 (on the New York Mercantile Exchange). Prices remained low through 2016, and while prices have recovered recently, they still remain lower than prices from earlier in the decade. As of December 31, 2017, the price per barrel was approximately $60. When the Company\u2019s customers experience low commodity prices or come to believe that they will be low in the future, they generally reduce their capital spending for offshore drilling, exploration and field development. The significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices that began in the second half of 2014 caused a reduction in many of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 exploratory, drilling, completion and other production activities and, as a result, related spending on the Company\u2019s services. As such, the Company\u2019s overall fleet utilization for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was 54%, 54% and 69%, respectively. The prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, has materially and adversely affected the Company by negatively impacting its fleet utilization, which in turn has negatively affected its revenues, cash flows and profitability, the fair market value of the Company\u2019s vessels and its ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital to finance its business. During the two years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company took an aggregate of $27.5 million and $119.7 million, respectively, of impairment charges primarily as a result of the low utilization rate of its fleet, coupled with the low rates per day worked over such two years. It could also affect the collectability of the Company\u2019s receivables and its ability to retain skilled personnel. Periods of low activity intensify price competition in the industry and can lead to the Company\u2019s vessels being idle for long periods of time.\nIf difficult market conditions persist and an anticipated recovery is delayed beyond the Company\u2019s expectation, further deterioration in the fair value of vessels already impaired or revisions to its forecasts may result in the Company recording additional impairment charges related to its fleet in future periods.\nDemand for many of the Company\u2019s services is impacted by the level of activity in the offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production industry.\nThe level of offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity has historically been volatile. This volatility is likely to continue. The level of activity is subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in a variety of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including:\n\u2022\nthe worldwide economic environment, trends in international trade or other economic trends, including recessions and the level of activity in energy-consuming markets;\n\u2022\nprevailing oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices and price volatility;\n\u2022\nassessments of offshore drilling prospects compared with land-based opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas offshore and the relative cost of, and success in, doing so on land;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of oil and natural gas and oil service companies operating offshore;\n\u2022\nworldwide supply and demand for energy, petroleum products and chemical products;\n\u2022\navailability and rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u2022\nfederal, state, local and international political and economic conditions, and policies including cabotage and local content laws;\n\u2022\ntechnological advancements affecting exploration, development, energy production and consumption;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil and natural gas production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\ninternational sanctions on oil producing countries and the lifting of certain sanctions against Iran;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest and the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities involving the Middle East, Russia, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulation;\n\u2022\nregulation of drilling activities and the availability of drilling permits and concessions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate or otherwise obtain funds for capital projects; and\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuel or energy sources.\nThe prolonged material downturn in oil and natural gas prices has caused a substantial decline in expenditures for exploration, development and production activity, which has resulted in a decline in demand and lower rates for the Company\u2019s offshore energy support services and, in turn, lower utilization levels over the last two years. The continuation or worsening of such decrease in activity is likely to further reduce the Company\u2019s day rates and its utilization, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. In addition, an increase in commodity demand and prices will not necessarily result in an immediate increase in offshore or petroleum drilling activity since project development lead and planning times, reserve replacement needs, expectations of future commodity demand, prices and supply of available competing vessels all combine to affect demand for the Company\u2019s vessels.\nMoreover, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 13%, 15% and 32%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s operating revenues were earned in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Historically, the Company has been and continues to be dependent on levels of activity in that region, which may differ from levels of activity in other regions of the world due to more localized factors. Although the Company has some ability to shift the location of its assets, it is unlikely that the Company would be able to shift a sufficient number of assets from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to counter a significant localized downturn in activity.\nUnconventional crude oil and natural gas sources and improved economics of producing natural gas and oil from such sources has and will likely continue to exert downward pricing pressures on the price of crude oil and natural gas.\nThe rise in production of crude oil and natural gas from shale in North America and the commissioning of a number of new large Liquefied Natural Gas export facilities around the world are, at least to date, the primary contributors to an over-supplied\nnatural gas market and a similar environment for the crude oil market. While production of crude oil and natural gas from unconventional sources is still a relatively small portion of the worldwide crude oil and natural gas production, improved drilling efficiencies are lowering the costs of extraction from these sources. The rise in production of natural gas and oil from these sources not only affects the price of oil but can also result in a reduction of capital invested in offshore oil and natural gas exploration. Because the Company provides vessels servicing offshore oil and natural gas exploration, a significant reduction in investments in offshore exploration and development in favor of investments in these unconventional resources could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nDifficult economic conditions and volatility in the capital markets could materially adversely affect the Company.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world that are outside the Company\u2019s control and difficult to predict. Factors such as commodity prices, interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, currency exchange rates and controls, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations) can have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and investments, which could reduce its revenues and profitability. Uncertainty about global economic conditions may lead or require businesses to postpone capital spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values and to cancel or renegotiate existing contracts because their access to capital is impeded. This would in turn affect the Company\u2019s profitability or results of operations. These factors may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial conditions of its customers. Volatility in the conditions of the global economic markets can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital at attractive prices. The Company\u2019s ongoing exposure to credit risks on its accounts receivable balances are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company has procedures that are designed to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its receivables; however, there can be no assurance that such procedures will effectively limit the Company\u2019s credit risk and avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. Unstable economic conditions may also increase the volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe Company may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle vessels.\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized impairment charges of $27.5 million, $119.7 million and $7.1 million, respectively, related to tangible assets. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low day or charter rates, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of the Company\u2019s assets may cause the Company to experience further losses. If there are indications that the carrying value of any of the Company\u2019s vessels may not be recoverable or if the Company sells assets for less than their then carrying value, the Company may recognize additional impairment charges on its fleet.\nFailure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to retain customers.\nThe Company\u2019s customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider. The Company must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to its customers. Should this not be achieved, the ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThere is a high level of competition in the offshore marine service industry.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry, and the competitive nature of its industry and excess supply of equipment is currently depressing charter and utilization rates. A prolonged period of depressed rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance. The Company competes for business on the basis of price, reputation for excellent service, quality, suitability and technical capabilities of its vessels, availability of vessels, safety and efficiency, cost of mobilizing vessels from one market to a different market, and national flag preference. Further, competition has intensified as lower activity in the offshore oil and natural gas market has led to lower utilization and additional capacity. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by regulations requiring, among other things, local construction, flagging, ownership or control of vessels, the awarding of contracts to local contractors, the employment of local citizens and/or the purchase of supplies from local vendors. If the Company is unable to successfully compete, it may have a materially adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nAn increase in the supply of vessels or equipment that serve offshore oil and natural gas operations could have an adverse impact on the charter rates earned by the Company\u2019s vessels and equipment.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive, with oversupply of vessel capacity and intense price competition. Expansion of the supply of vessels and equipment that serve offshore oil and natural gas operations has increased competition in the markets in which the Company operates and affected prices charged by operators. Further, the refurbishment of disused or \u201cmothballed\u201d vessels, conversion of vessels from uses other than oil and natural gas exploration and production support and related activities or construction of new vessels and equipment have all added vessel and equipment capacity to current worldwide levels. The current oversupply of vessels and equipment capacity in the offshore marine market could lower charter rates and result in\nlower operating revenues, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company relies on several customers for a significant share of its revenues, the loss of any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies and government agencies. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company\u2019s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 59%, 58% and 55% of its operating revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer, Perenco UK Limited, was responsible for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s operating revenues. The portion of the Company\u2019s revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time, depending on the level of activity by any such customer, the Company\u2019s ability to meet the customer\u2019s needs and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. In addition, most of the Company\u2019s contracts with its oil and natural gas customers can be canceled on relatively short notice and do not commit its customers to acquire specific amounts of services or require the payment of significant liquidated damages upon cancellation. The loss of business from any of the Company\u2019s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Further, to the extent any of the Company\u2019s customers experience an extended period of operating difficulty, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, revenues, results of operation, cash flows and growth prospects.\nConsolidation of the Company\u2019s customer base could adversely affect demand for its services and reduce its revenues.\nIn recent years, oil and natural gas companies, energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible. Consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for the Company\u2019s services. Also, merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration, development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed. Such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation, which could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s vessels thereby reducing its revenues.\nThe Company may be unable to maintain or replace its offshore support vessels as they age.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the average age of the Company\u2019s owned vessels, excluding its standby safety and wind farm utility vessels, was approximately 11 years. The Company believes that after a vessel has been in service for approximately 20 years, the expense (which typically increases with age) necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable. In addition, the Company must maintain its vessels to remain attractive to its customers and comply with regulations; however, the Company may be unable to carry out drydockings of its vessels or may be limited by insufficient shipyard capacity, which could adversely affect its ability to maintain its vessels. In addition, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable the Company to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels, or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe failure to successfully complete construction or conversion of the Company\u2019s vessels, repairs, maintenance or routine drydockings on schedule and on budget could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nFrom time to time, the Company may have a number of vessels under conversion and may plan to construct or convert other vessels in response to current and future market conditions. The Company also routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance. Construction and conversion projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, lack of shipyard availability, unforeseen engineering problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor. A significant delay in either construction or drydockings could have a material adverse effect on contract commitments and revenues with respect to vessels under construction, conversion or undergoing drydockings. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction, conversion or retrofit could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe operations of the Company\u2019s fleet may be subject to seasonal factors.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s offshore support services is directly affected by the levels of offshore drilling and production activity. Budgets of many of the Company\u2019s customers are based upon a calendar year, and demand for the Company\u2019s services has historically been stronger in the second and third calendar quarters when allocated budgets are expended by its customers and weather conditions are more favorable for offshore activities. In particular, the demand for the Company\u2019s liftboat fleet in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore support vessels in the Middle East are seasonal with peak demand normally occurring during\nthe summer months. Adverse events relating to the Company\u2019s vessels or business operations during peak demand periods could have a more significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. Additionally, seasonal volatility can create unpredictability in activity and utilization rates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company has high levels of fixed costs that will be incurred regardless of its level of business activity.\nThe Company\u2019s business has high fixed costs. Downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand, as is currently being experienced, can have a significant negative effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition. Some of the Company\u2019s fixed costs will not decline during periods of reduced revenue or activity. During times of reduced utilization, the Company may not be able to reduce its costs immediately as it may incur additional costs associated with preparing vessels for cold stacking. Moreover, the Company may not be able to fully reduce the cost of its support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining vessels in that region. A decline in revenue due to lower day rates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in the Company\u2019s fixed costs and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nAs the markets recover or the Company changes its marketing strategies or for other reasons, the Company may be required to incur higher than expected costs to return previously cold-stacked vessels to class.\nIn response to the decrease in demand stemming from lower oil and natural gas prices, the Company has cold-stacked a number of offshore support vessels. As of December 31, 2017, 37 of its 141 owned and leased-in offshore support vessels were cold-stacked worldwide. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to quickly bring these cold-stacked offshore support vessels back into service or that the cost of doing so would not be significant. Cold-stacked vessels are not always maintained with the same diligence as the Company\u2019s marketed fleet. As a result, and depending on the length of time the vessels are cold-stacked, the Company could incur deferred drydocking costs for regulatory recertification to return these vessels to active service and may incur costs to hire and train mariners to operate such vessels. These costs are difficult to estimate and could be substantial. Delay in reactivating cold stacked offshore support vessels and the costs and other expenses related to the reactivation of cold-stacked offshore support vessels could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for its vessels.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of its customers. Given the highly competitive and historically cyclical nature of the industry, the Company may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or it may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at rates that are below, and potentially substantially below, existing day rates, or that have terms that are less favorable to the Company than its existing contracts, or it may be unable to secure contracts for these vessels. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe early termination of contracts on the Company\u2019s vessels could have a material adverse effect on its operations.\nMost of the long-term contracts for the Company\u2019s vessels contain early termination options in favor of the customer. Although some of such contracts have early termination remedies or other provisions designed to discourage the customer from exercising such options, the Company cannot assure investors that its customers would not choose to exercise their termination rights in spite of such remedies or the threat of litigation with the Company. Until replacement of such business with other customers, any termination could temporarily disrupt the Company\u2019s business or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The Company might not be able to replace such business on economically equivalent terms. In addition, during the current and prior downturns, the Company has experienced customers requesting contractual concessions even though such concessions were contrary to existing contractual terms. While the Company may not be legally required to give concessions, commercial considerations may dictate that it do so. If the Company is unable to collect amounts owed to it or long-term contracts for its vessels are terminated and its vessels are not sufficiently utilized, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nIncreased domestic and international laws and regulations may materially adversely impact the Company, and the Company may become subject to additional international laws and regulations in the event of high profile incidents, such as the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig incident and resulting oil spill.\nChanges in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development activities and technical and operational measures, whether or not in connection with specific incidents, may increase the Company\u2019s costs and the costs of its customers\u2019 operations. For instance, on April 22, 2010, an incident involving, the Deepwater Horizon, a semi-submersible deep water drilling rig operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,resulted in fatalities and a significant flow of hydrocarbons from the BP Macondo well (the \u201cDeepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident\u201d). In response to the Deepwater Horizon/BP Macondo Well Incident, the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and natural gas exploration, including the U.S. Department of the\nInterior and its relevant various sub-agencies, imposed temporary moratoria on drilling operations, by requiring operators to reapply for exploration plans and drilling permits that had previously been approved, and by adopting numerous new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations regarding offshore operations that are applicable to the Company\u2019s customers and with which their new applications for exploration plans and drilling permits must prove compliant. Compliance with these new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations have materially increased the cost of drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. New or additional government regulations or laws concerning drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other regions have in the past and could in the future materially increase the cost of drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and/or cause additional moratoria on drilling activities. These changes may influence decisions by customers or other industry participants that could reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s services, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and natural gas.\nThe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the release or continued use of offshore resources for oil and natural gas production. Because the Company\u2019s operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production, the government\u2019s exercise of authority under the provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to restrict the availability of offshore oil and natural gas leases (for example, due to a serious incident of pollution) could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company is subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nIncreasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing worker safety and health and the manning, construction and operation of vessels significantly affect the Company\u2019s operations. Many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation and oversight, including by the USCG, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the NTSB, the EPA, IMO, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Maritime Administration, the CBP, the BSEE, and state environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and to regulation by states and classification societies (such as the American Bureau of Shipping). The Company is also subject to regulation under international treaties, such as (i) MARPOL; (ii) SOL, and (iii) STCW. These agencies, organizations, regulations and treaties establish safety requirements and standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved safety standards. The CBP and USCG are authorized to inspect vessels at will. The Company has and will continue to spend significant funds to comply with these regulations and treaties. Failure to comply with these regulations and treaties may cause the Company to incur significant liabilities or restrictions on its operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health, including laws and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into waters regulated thereunder. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, or other sanctions, or the suspension or termination of the Company\u2019s operations. Compliance with such laws and regulations frequently require installation of costly equipment, increased manning, increased fuel costs, specific training, or operational changes. Some environmental laws impose strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous materials and damage to natural resources, which could subject the Company to liability without regard to whether it is negligent or at fault. Under OPA 90, owners, operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the removal costs and damages resulting from the discharge of oil within the navigable waters of the United States and the U.S. EEZ. In addition, an oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties, criminal liability and costs for natural resource and other damages under other federal and state laws and civil actions. Liability for a catastrophic spill could exceed the Company\u2019s available insurance coverage and result in it having to liquidate assets to pay claims. These laws and regulations may expose the Company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, including charterers. Because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations. Additionally, reduced enforcement of existing safety and other laws or regulations may result in a decline in the demand for the Company\u2019s offshore support services that are provided in connection with compliance with such laws or regulations. The Company cannot be certain that existing laws, regulations or standards (and the enforcement thereof), as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws and regulations and standards will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. Regulation of the offshore marine services industry will likely continue to become more stringent and more expensive for the Company. In addition, a serious marine incident that results in significant pollution or injury could result in additional regulation and lead to strict governmental enforcement or other legal challenges. The variability and uncertainty of current and future shipping regulations could hamper the ability of the Company and its customers to plan for the future or establish long-term strategies. Additional environmental and other requirements, as well as more stringent enforcement policies,\nmay be adopted that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate, require the Company to incur substantial additional costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. For more information, see \u201cBusiness-Environmental Compliance.\u201d\nThe Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain, maintain and periodically renew certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations or vessels. In certain instances, the failure to obtain, maintain or renew these authorizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThere are risks associated with climate change and environmental regulations.\nGovernments around the world have, in recent years, placed increasing attention on matters affecting the environment and this could lead to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that in turn could result in a reduction in demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel. In fact, a number of countries and the IMO have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures or international treaties may include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy and could include specific restrictions on shipping emissions.\nGovernments could also pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy. These requirements could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and therefore the services provided by the Company. Alternatively, changes in U.S. law permitting additional drilling on federal lands could divert capital from offshore exploration. In addition, new environmental or emissions control laws or regulations may require an increase in the Company\u2019s operating costs and/or in its capital spending for additional equipment or personnel to comply with such requirements and could also result in a reduction in revenues due to downtime required for the installation of such equipment. Such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nA violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) or similar worldwide anti-bribery laws may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nIn order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, the Company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners. As a U.S. corporation, the Company is subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business. The Company has stringent policies and procedures in place to enforce compliance with the FCPA. Nevertheless, the Company does business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may not be customary and the Company may be held liable for actions taken by its strategic or local partners even though these partners may not be subject to the FCPA. The Company\u2019s personnel and intermediaries, including its local operators and strategic partners, may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by government officials, political parties and officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities in the countries in which it operates or may operate in the future. As a result, the Company faces the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of its employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to the Company\u2019s control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or other similar laws to which the Company may be subject. Any allegation or determination that the Company has violated the FCPA (or any other applicable anti-bribery laws in countries in which the Company does business, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010) could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company has significant international operations, which subjects it to risks. Unstable political, military and economic conditions in foreign countries where a significant proportion of the Company\u2019s operations is conducted could materially adversely impact its business.\nThe Company operates vessels and transacts other business worldwide. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 87%, 85% and 68%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s operating revenues and $1.9 million, $(4.2) million, and $8.6 million. respectively, of its equity in earnings (losses) from 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, were derived from its foreign operations. These operations are subject to risks, including potential vessel seizure, terrorist acts, piracy, kidnapping, nationalization of assets, currency restrictions, import or export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Economic sanctions or an oil embargo, for example, could have significant impact on activity in the oil and natural gas industry and, correspondingly, on the Company should it operate vessels in a country subject to any sanctions or embargo, or in the surrounding region to the extent any sanctions or embargo disrupts its operations.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s ability to compete in international markets may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors, or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. Further, the Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company.\nActivity outside the United States involves additional risks, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nUnited States embargoes or restrictive actions by United States and foreign governments that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to provide services in foreign countries or cause retaliatory actions by such governments;\n\u2022\na change in, or the imposition of, withholding or other taxes on foreign income, tariffs or restrictions on foreign trade and investment;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of earnings or currency exchange controls and import/export quotas;\n\u2022\nunwaivable, burdensome local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements;\n\u2022\nnationalization, expropriation, asset seizure, blockades and blacklisting;\n\u2022\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nloss of contract rights and inability to enforce contracts;\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets, such as terrorist acts, piracy and kidnapping;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange that affect demand for the Company\u2019s services and its profitability;\n\u2022\npotential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010;\n\u2022\nlabor strikes;\n\u2022\nimport or export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations.\nThe United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum on June 23, 2016 regarding its membership in the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d) in which a majority of the U.K. electorate voted in favor of the British government taking the necessary action for the U.K. to withdraw from the E.U. (the \u201cBrexit\u201d). On March 29, 2017, the U.K. notified the E.U. that it intended to withdraw from the E.U. as provided in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (\u201cArticle 50\u201d). The terms of the withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the withdrawal notification date.\nThe Company faces risks associated with the uncertainty following the referendum, the Article 50 notification, and the consequences that may result from the U.K.\u2019s decision to exit the E.U. Among other things, the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the E.U., along with calls for the governments of other E.U. member states to also consider withdrawal, has caused, and is anticipated to continue to cause, significant new uncertainties and instability in European and global financial markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may affect the Company and the trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. In addition, the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. could lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty and potentially divergent treaties, laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. treaties, laws and regulations to replace or replicate, including those governing maritime, labor, environmental, competition and other matters applicable to the provision of support vessel services. The impact on the Company\u2019s business of any treaties, laws and regulations with and in the U.K. that replace the existing E.U. counterparts cannot be predicted. Any of these effects, and others the Company cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s results could be impacted by U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions as well as by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government.\nChanges in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade (including the North American Free Trade Agreement and U.S. tariff policies), travel to and from the United States, immigration, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries in which the Company operates, and any negative sentiments or retaliatory actions towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the global marine and support transportation services industry, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company is subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of its business. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. The Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that which\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects should it fail to prevail in certain matters.\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s debt structure.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company has $314.9 million of outstanding indebtedness, including the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and obligations under secured notes and credit facilities secured by mortgages on various vessels.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to meet its debt service obligations and refinance its current indebtedness, as well as any future debt that it may incur, will depend upon its ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales, which are subject to general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s results of operations, industry cycles, seasonality and financial, business, the general state of the capital markets at the time it seeks to refinance its debt and other factors, some of which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the Company cannot repay or refinance its debt as it becomes due, the Company may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including undertaking alternative financing plans, which may have onerous terms or may be unavailable, dedicating an unsustainable level of the Company\u2019s cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and/or reducing the amount of liquidity available for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Company\u2019s failure to pay or refinance its current or future debt under a credit facility when it becomes due could lead to the acceleration of all amounts due under such facility and potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the Company\u2019s other debt facilities. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s debt facilities contain, and its future debt facilities may contain, restrictive and/or financial maintenance covenants, including requirements to maintain a minimum level of liquidity which could also affect cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in the lenders accelerating all amounts due under the facility and potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the Company\u2019s other debt facilities. The Company\u2019s obligations to repay indebtedness and comply with restrictive and/or financial maintenance covenants could also impair its ability to rapidly respond to changes in its business or industry and withstand competitive pressures. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information. The Company\u2019s overall debt level and/or market conditions could limit its ability to issue additional debt in amounts and/or on terms that it considers reasonable.\nThe Company is subject to hazards customary for the operation of vessels that could disrupt operations and expose it to liability.\nThe operation of offshore support and related vessels is subject to various risks, including catastrophic disaster, adverse weather, mechanical failure and collision. For instance, the Company\u2019s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico may be adversely affected by weather. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November. Tropical storms and hurricanes may limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate vessels in the proximity of storms, reduce oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, and could result in the Company incurring additional expenses to secure equipment and facilities. They may also require the Company to evacuate its vessels, personnel and equipment out of the path of a storm. Additional risks to vessels include adverse sea conditions, capsizing, grounding, oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors. These risks could endanger the safety of the Company\u2019s personnel, equipment, cargo and other property, as well as the environment. If any of these events were to occur, the Company could be held liable for resulting damages, including loss of revenues from or termination of charter contracts, higher insurance rates, increased operating costs, increased governmental regulation and reporting and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and customer relationships. Any such events would likely result in negative publicity for the Company and adversely affect its safety record, which would affect demand for its services in a competitive industry. In addition, the affected vessels could be removed from service and would then not be available to generate revenues.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect it from the liabilities that could arise in its business.\nAlthough the Company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its business, risks may arise for which it may not be insured. Claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles, the aggregate amount of which could be material, and certain policies impose caps on coverage. Insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions, the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy. There also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims. If a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured, or the carrier is unable or unwilling to cover the claim, the Company could be exposed to substantial liability. Further, to the extent the proceeds from insurance are not sufficient to repair or replace a damaged asset, the Company would be required to expend funds to supplement the insurance and in certain circumstances may decide that such expenditures are not justified, which, in either case, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and ability to grow.\nThe Company may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect its financial condition and its results of operations, and may result in additional risks to its business.\nThe Company continuously evaluates the acquisition and disposition of assets relevant to participants in the offshore oil and natural gas industry and may in the future undertake significant transactions. Any such transaction could be material to the Company\u2019s business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, joint ventures, investments in new lines of business\nand the purchase of equity interests or assets. The form of consideration associated with such transactions may include, among other things, cash, Common Stock, securities convertible into Common Stock or other securities (privately or through a public offering), equity interests in the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, or other assets of the Company. The Company also evaluates the disposition of its assets, in whole or in part, which could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests in its subsidiaries (privately or through a public offering).\nThese types of significant transactions may present material risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant revenue and income streams, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, potential acceleration of taxes currently deferred, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain covenants in the Company\u2019s debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, the Company cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of the anticipated benefits of the transaction or that significant transactions will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or its results of operations. If the Company was to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, it may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in the amount of debt the Company has or the number of outstanding shares of its Common Stock.\nIf the Company does not restrict the amount of ownership of its Common Stock by non-U.S. citizens, it could be prohibited from operating offshore support vessels in the United States, which would adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe Company is subject to the Jones Act, which governs, among other things, the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry passengers and cargo between points in the United States. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S. flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews and be owned and operated by \u201cU.S. citizens\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act. Compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% in the entities that directly or indirectly own the vessels that the Company operates in U.S. coastwise trade. Although the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the Jones Act, a failure to maintain compliance could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could temporarily or permanently prohibit the Company from operating vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade. In addition, the Company could be subject to fines and its vessels could be subject to seizure and forfeiture for violations of the Jones Act and the related U. S. vessel documentation laws.\nRepeal, amendment, suspension or non-enforcement of the Jones Act would result in additional competition for the Company and could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nSubstantial portions of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and thus subject to the provisions of the Jones Act (discussed above). For years, there have been attempts to repeal or amend such provisions, and such attempts are expected to continue in the future.\nFor example, in a 2017 congressional review of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial situation following Hurricane Maria, several proponents of repealing the Jones Act offered bills to exempt the island from the Jones Act. Although the proposals were limited in scope and failed, there is a risk that such legislation could be reintroduced by the special committee tasked with overseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s financial reorganization or others, which could lead to broader legislation affecting other aspects of the Jones Act.\nUnder certain conditions, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security can grant waivers of the Jones Act to foreign vessel operators. Thus far, the Secretary has granted waivers only for relatively short periods in connection with natural disasters and the transportation of petroleum released from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Nonetheless, future waivers, particularly if for longer periods, could result in increased competition, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s Jones Act operations.\nRepeal, substantial amendment or waiver of provisions of the Jones Act could significantly adversely affect the Company by, among other things, resulting in additional competition from competitors with lower operating costs, because of their ability to use vessels built in lower-cost foreign shipyards, owned and manned by foreign nationals with promotional foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than U.S. citizens. In addition, the Company\u2019s advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of maritime cargo between covered U.S. points could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels. Because foreign vessels may have lower construction costs and operate at significantly lower costs than companies operating in the U.S. coastwise trade, such a change could significantly increase competition in the U.S. coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nRestrictions on non-U.S. citizen ownership of the Company\u2019s vessels could limit its ability to sell off any portion of its business or result in the forfeiture of its vessels.\nAs noted above, compliance with the Jones Act requires that non-U.S. citizens own no more than 25% in the entities that directly or indirectly own the vessels that the Company operates in the U.S. coastwise trade. If the Company was to seek to sell any portion of its business that owns any of these vessels, it would have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the U.S. citizenship restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of the Company\u2019s business may not attain the amount that could be obtained through unconstrained bidding. Furthermore, if at any point the Company or any of the entities that directly or indirectly own its vessels cease to satisfy the requirements to be a U.S. citizen within the meaning of the Jones Act, the Company would become ineligible to operate in the U.S. coastwise trade and may become subject to penalties and risk forfeiture of its vessels.\nThe Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its second amended and restated bylaws limit the ownership of Common Stock by individuals and entities that are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. These restrictions may affect the liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and may result in non-U.S. citizens being required to sell their shares at a loss or relinquish their voting, dividend and distribution rights.\nUnder the Jones Act, at least 75% of the outstanding shares of each class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its second amended and restated bylaws are intended to facilitate compliance with this requirement and may have an adverse effect on holders of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nUnder the provisions of the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the aggregate percentage of ownership by non-U.S. citizens of any class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock is limited to 22.5% of the outstanding shares of each such class or series to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%. The Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation also restricts ownership of shares of any class or series of its capital stock by a single non-U.S. citizen (and any other non-U.S. citizen whose ownership position would be aggregated with such non-U.S. citizen for purposes of the Jones Act) to not more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of each such class or series. The Company refers to such percentage limitations on ownership by persons who are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act as the \u201capplicable permitted percentage.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any transfer or purported transfer of any shares of any class or series of its capital stock that would otherwise result in ownership (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens of shares of such class or series in excess of the applicable permitted percentage will be void and ineffective, and neither the Company nor its transfer agent will register any such transfer or purported transfer in the Company records or recognize any such transferee or purported transferee as a stockholder of the Company for any purpose (including for purposes of voting and dividends) except to the extent necessary to effect the remedies available to the Company under its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nIn the event such transfer restriction would be ineffective for any reason, the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any transfer would otherwise result in ownership (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens of shares of such class or series in excess of the applicable permitted percentage, such transfer will cause such excess shares to be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries that are U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. The proposed transferee will have no rights in the shares transferred to the trust, and the trustee, who will be a U.S. citizen chosen by the Company and unaffiliated with the Company or the proposed transferee, will have all voting, dividend and distribution rights associated with the shares held in the trust. The trustee will sell such excess shares to a U.S. citizen within 20 days of receiving notice from the Company (or as soon thereafter as a sale may be effected in compliance with all applicable securities laws) and distribute to the proposed transferee the lesser of the price that the proposed transferee paid for such shares and the amount received from the sale, and any gain from the sale will be paid to the charitable beneficiary of the trust.\nThese trust transfer provisions also apply to situations where ownership of a class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock by non-U.S. citizens in excess of the applicable permitted percentage would result from a change in the status of a record or beneficial owner thereof from a U.S. citizen to a non-U.S. citizen or from a repurchase or redemption by the Company of shares of its capital stock, in which case such person will receive the lesser of the market price of the shares on the date of such status change or such share repurchase or redemption and the amount received from the sale. As part of the foregoing trust transfer provisions, the trustee will be deemed to have offered the excess shares in the trust to the Company at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the market price on the date the Company accepts the offer and (ii) the price per share in the purported transfer or original issuance of shares, as described in the preceding paragraph, or the market price per share on the date of the status change or share repurchase or redemption, that resulted in the transfer to the trust.\nAs a result of the above trust transfer provisions, a proposed transferee that is a non-U.S. citizen, or a record or beneficial owner whose citizenship status change results in excess shares, or whose shares become excess shares as a result of a repurchase\nor redemption by the Company of its capital stock may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss.\nTo the extent that the above trust transfer provisions would be ineffective for any reason to prevent ownership (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens of the shares of any class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock in excess of the applicable permitted percentage, the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Company, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to redeem all or any portion of such excess shares most recently acquired (as determined by the Company in accordance with guidelines that are set forth in its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation), by non-U.S. citizens, or owned (of record or beneficially) by non-U.S. citizens as a result of a change in citizenship status or a repurchase or redemption by the Company of shares of its capital stock, at a redemption price based on a fair market value formula that is set forth in the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The per share redemption price may be paid, as determined by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, by cash, promissory notes, warrants or a combination thereof. Such excess shares shall not be accorded any voting, dividend or distribution rights until they have ceased to be excess shares, provided that they have not been already redeemed by the Company. As a result of the above provisions, a proposed transferee or owner of the Company\u2019s Common Stock that is a non-U.S. citizen may not receive any return on its investment in shares it purportedly purchases or owns, as the case may be, and it may sustain a loss. Further, the Company may have to incur additional indebtedness, or use available cash (if any), to fund all or a portion of such redemption, in which case its financial condition may be materially weakened.\nSo that the Company may ensure its compliance with the Jones Act, its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits the Company to require that any record or beneficial owner of any shares of its capital stock provide the Company with certain documentation concerning such owner\u2019s citizenship. These provisions include a requirement that every person acquiring, directly or indirectly, five percent (5%) or more of the shares of any class or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock must provide the Company with specified citizenship documentation. In the event that any person does not submit such requested or required documentation to the Company, the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides it with certain remedies, including the suspension of the voting rights of such person\u2019s shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock and the payment of dividends and distributions with respect to those shares into an escrow account. As a result of non-compliance with these provisions, a record or beneficial owner of the shares of Common Stock may lose significant rights associated with those shares.\nIn addition to the risks described above, the foregoing restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. citizens could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the Company\u2019s Common Stock or otherwise be in the best interest of its stockholders.\nIf non-U.S. citizens own more than 22.5% of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, the Company may not have the funds or the ability to redeem any excess shares and it could be forced to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade.\nThe Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions prohibiting ownership of its Common Stock by persons who are not U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, in the aggregate, in excess of 22.5% of such shares, in order to ensure that such ownership by non-U.S. citizens will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by the Jones Act, which is presently 25%. The Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its second amended and restated bylaws permit the Company to redeem such excess shares in the event that the transfer of such excess shares to a trust for sale would be ineffective. The per share redemption price may be paid, as determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors, by cash, promissory notes or warrants. However, the Company may not be able to redeem such excess shares for cash because its operations may not have generated sufficient excess cash flow to fund such redemption. If, for any reason, the Company is unable to effect such a redemption when such ownership of shares by non-U.S. citizens is in excess of 25% of the Common Stock, or otherwise prevent non-U.S. citizens in the aggregate from owning shares in excess of 25% of any such class or series of its capital stock, or fail to exercise its redemption rights because it is unaware that such ownership exceeds such percentage, the Company will likely be unable to comply with the Jones Act and will likely be required by the applicable governmental authorities to suspend its operations in the U.S. coastwise trade. Any such actions by governmental authorities would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S.-flag vessels are subject to requisition for ownership or use by the United States in case of national emergency or national defense need.\nThe Merchant Marine Act of 1936 provides that, during a national emergency declared by presidential proclamation or a period for which the President has proclaimed that the security of the national defense makes it advisable, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition the ownership or use of any vessel owned by U.S. citizens (which includes the Company) and any vessel under construction in the United States. If any of the Company\u2019s vessels were purchased or chartered by the federal government under this law, the Company would be entitled to just compensation, which is generally the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a charter, the fair market value of charter hire, but the Company would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages it may suffer. The purchase or charter for an extended period of time by\nthe federal government of one or more of the Company\u2019s vessels under this law could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company may not be fully indemnified by its customers for damage to their property or the property of their other contractors.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated. Additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in the Company\u2019s contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and the Company could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. The indemnification provisions of the Company\u2019s contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or courts may find them to be unenforceable, void or limited by public policy considerations, including when the cause of the underlying loss or damage is the Company\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct, when punitive damages are attributable to the Company or when fines or penalties are imposed directly against the Company. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Current or future litigation in particular jurisdictions, whether or not the Company is a party, may impact the interpretation and enforceability of indemnification provisions in the Company\u2019s contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s contracts with its customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect the Company against all hazards and risks inherent in its operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify the Company will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.\nThe Company may not be able to sell vessels to improve its cash flow and liquidity because it may be unable to locate buyers with access to financing or to complete any sales on acceptable terms or within a reasonable time frame.\nThe Company may seek to sell some of its vessels to provide liquidity and cash flow. However, given the current downturn in the oil and natural gas industry, there may not be sufficient activity in the market to sell the Company\u2019s vessels and it may not be able to identify buyers with access to financing or to complete any such sales. Even if the Company is able to locate appropriate buyers for its vessels, any sales may occur on less favorable terms than the terms that might be available in a more liquid market or at other times in the business cycle. In addition, the terms of the Company\u2019s current and future indebtedness may limit its ability to sell assets, including vessels, or require that it use the proceeds from any such sale in specified manner.\nThe Company may be unable to collect amounts owed to it by its customers.\nThe Company typically grants its customers credit on a short-term basis. Related credit risks are inherent as the Company does not typically collateralize receivables due from customers. In addition, many of its international customers are state controlled and, as a result, the Company\u2019s receivables may be subject to local political priorities, which are out of the Company\u2019s control. The Company provides estimates for uncollectible accounts based primarily on its judgment using historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer as evidence supporting the receivables valuations stated on the Company\u2019s financial statements. However, the Company\u2019s receivables valuation estimates may not be accurate and receivables due from customers reflected in its financial statements may not be collectible. The Company\u2019s inability to perform under its contractual obligations, or its customers\u2019 inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments to the Company, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company participates in joint ventures, and its investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by its lack of sole decision-making authority and disputes between its partners and itself.\nThe Company participates in domestic and international joint ventures to further expand its capabilities, share risks and gain access to local markets. Due to the nature of joint venture arrangements, the Company does not unilaterally control the operating, strategic and financial policies of these business ventures. Decisions are often made on a collective basis, including the purchase and sale of assets, charter arrangements with customers and cash distributions to partners. In addition, joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions, which means that each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions, which could lead to deadlock in the operations of the joint venture or partnership. Decisions made by the managers or the boards of these entities may not always be the decision that is most beneficial to the Company as one of the equity holders of the entity and may be contrary to the Company\u2019s objectives and may limit the Company\u2019s ability to transfer its interests. Investments in joint ventures involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that the Company\u2019s co-ventures might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to the Company or to third parties, or any disputes with respect to the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s participation in industry-wide, multi-employer, defined benefit pension plans expose it to potential future losses.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are participating employers in two industry-wide, multi-employer defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., the U.K. Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (\u201cMNOPF\u201d) and the U.K. Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (\u201cMNRPF\u201d). Among other risks associated with multi-employer plans, contributions and unfunded obligations of the multi-employer plan are shared by the plan participants. As a result, the Company may inherit unfunded obligations if other plan participants withdraw from the plan or cease to participate, and in the event that the Company withdraws from participation in one or both of these plans, it may be required to pay the plan an amount based on its allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan. Depending on the results of future actuarial valuations, it is possible that the plans could experience further deficits that will require funding from the Company, which would negatively impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact the Company.\nMedia coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by the Company, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and the morale of its employees, which could materially adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks.\nThe Company is exposed to certain foreign currency, interest rate, fixed-income, equity and commodity price risks and, although some of these risks may be hedged, fluctuations could impact its financial position and its results of operations. The Company has, and anticipates that it will continue to have, contracts denominated in foreign currencies. It is often not practicable for the Company to effectively hedge the entire risk of significant changes in currency rates during a contract period. The Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been negatively impacted for certain periods and positively impacted for other periods, and may continue to be affected to a material extent by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For example, strengthening of the U.S. dollar could give rise to reduced prices from shipyards and incentivize additional investment in new equipment notwithstanding the current state of such market. The Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows may also be affected by the cost of hedging activities that it undertakes. Volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty also increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on the Company\u2019s debt and equity instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. In addition, changes in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. Specifically, rising interest rates, including a potential rapid rise in interest rates, could increase the Company\u2019s cost of capital.\nThe Company engages in hedging activities which exposes it to risks.\nFor corporate purposes and also as part of its trading activities, the Company has in the past and may in the future use futures and swaps to hedge risks, such as escalation in fuel costs and movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Such activities can themselves result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. The Company may also purchase inventory in larger than usual levels to lock in costs when it believes there may be large increases in the price of raw materials or other material used in its business. Such purchases expose the Company to risks of meeting margin calls and drawing on its capital, counter-party risk due to failure of an exchange or institution with which it has entered into a swap, incurring higher costs than competitors or similar businesses that do not engage in such strategies, and losses on its investment portfolio. Such strategies can also cause earnings to be volatile. If the Company fails to offset such volatility, this may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe final impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be materially different from the Company\u2019s current estimates.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act introduced significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Company continues to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on its business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of Tax Act, the estimated impact of the new law is based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based upon the Company\u2019s further analysis of the new law.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel and crew its vessels could have an adverse effect on its business.\nAttracting and retaining skilled personnel is an important factor in the Company\u2019s future success. In addition, the success of the Company is dependent upon its ability to adequately crew its vessels. The market for qualified personnel is highly competitive and the Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel and crewing its vessels in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on key members of its management, the loss of whom could disrupt its business operations.\nThe Company depends to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of its executive officers and key management personnel. It does not maintain key-man insurance. The loss of services of one or more of its executive officers or key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s employees are covered by federal laws that may subject it to job-related claims in addition to those provided by state laws.\nSome of the Company\u2019s employees are covered by provisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act and general maritime law. These laws preempt state workers\u2019 compensation laws and permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job-related incidents in federal courts based on tort theories. Because the Company is not generally protected by the damage limits imposed by state workers\u2019 compensation statutes for these types of claims, it may have greater exposure for any claims made by these employees.\nThe Company relies on information technology, and if it is unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted and its business could be negatively affected.\nThe Company relies on its own and third-party service providers\u2019 information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information; to capture knowledge of its business including its vessel operation systems containing information about vessel positioning and scheduling; to monitor its vessel maintenance and engine systems; to coordinate its business across its bases of operation including cargo delivery and equipment tracking; and to communicate within its organization and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third-parties. The Company\u2019s ability to service customers and operate vessels is dependent on the continued operation of these systems. These information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, hardware or software failures, power outages, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. The Company\u2019s technology systems are also subject to cybersecurity attacks including malware, other malicious software, phishing email attacks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to its data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of its data, loss or damage to its data delivery systems and other electronic security breaches.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems are in some cases integrated, so damage, disruption or shutdown to the system could result in a more widespread impact. If the Company\u2019s information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and its business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s operations could be disrupted and its business could be negatively affected. In addition, cyber-attacks could lead to potential unauthorized access and disclosure of confidential information, data loss and corruption. There is no assurance that the Company will not experience these service interruptions or cyber-attacks in the future. Recent action by the IMO\u2019s Maritime Safety Committee and United States agencies indicate that cybersecurity regulations for the maritime industry are likely to be further developed in the near future in an attempt to combat cybersecurity threats. The Company is unable to predict the impact of such regulations at this time. Further, as the methods of cyber-attacks continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks.\nRisk Factors Related to the Company\u2019s Spin-off\nThe Company relies on SEACOR Holdings\u2019 performance under various agreements and the Company will continue to be dependent on SEACOR Holdings to provide it with support services for its business. In addition, SEACOR Holdings will rely on the Company\u2019s performance under various agreements.\nThe Company has entered into various agreements with SEACOR Holdings in connection with the Spin-off, including two Transition Services Agreements, a Distribution Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. These agreements govern the Company\u2019s relationship with SEACOR Holdings subsequent to the Spin-off including administrative and similar services that each company will provide to the other under the Transition Services Agreements. It is possible that if SEACOR Holdings were to fail to fulfill its obligations under these agreements the Company could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.\nIf the Company is required to indemnify SEACOR Holdings for certain liabilities and related losses arising in connection with any of these agreements, the Company may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially adversely affect its financial position. Specifically, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company and SEACOR Holdings are required to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause SEACOR Holdings to be released from any guarantees it has given to third-parties on the Company\u2019s behalf or on behalf of the Company\u2019s 50% or less owned companies. If SEACOR Holdings is not released under any of these guarantees, the Company is required to indemnify SEACOR Holdings for any liabilities incurred as a guarantor. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate amount of obligations that SEACOR Holdings has guaranteed on the Company\u2019s behalf was $69.1 million. Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company must pay SEACOR Holdings a fee of 0.5% per annum of the aggregate amount of guaranteed by SEACOR Holdings.\nUnder the terms of the Transition Services Agreements, the Company and SEACOR Holdings provide each other with certain support services on an interim basis following the Spin-off. The Company expects these services to be provided for varying durations but no greater than two years following the Spin-off.\nAlthough SEACOR Holdings is contractually obligated to provide the Company with services during the term of the agreement, the Company cannot assure investors that the services will be performed as efficiently or proficiently after the expiration of the agreement, or that the Company will be able to replace these services in a timely manner or on comparable terms. They also contain provisions that may be more favorable than terms and provisions the Company might have obtained in arms-length negotiations with unaffiliated third parties. When SEACOR Holdings ceases to provide services pursuant to the agreement, the Company\u2019s costs of procuring those services from third parties may increase. In addition, the Company may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those under the SEACOR Holdings Transition Services Agreement. Although the Company intends to replace some of the services provided by SEACOR Holdings under the SEACOR Holdings Transition Services Agreement, the Company may encounter difficulties replacing certain services or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those it currently has in effect. To the extent that the Company may require additional support from SEACOR Holdings not addressed in the SEACOR Holdings Transition Services Agreement, the Company would need to negotiate the terms of receiving such support in future agreements. Further, if the Company fails to perform under the SEACOR Marine Transition Services Agreement, depending upon the circumstance surrounding the failure, it may become liable to SEACOR Holdings for damages.\nThe Company may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Spin-off, and the Spin-off could harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Spin-off, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Spin-off and distribution was expected to provide various benefits, including, among others, enhanced strategic and management focus, improved management incentive tools and a distinct investment identity.\nThe Company may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe Spin-off will require significant amounts of management\u2019s time and effort and the complexity of the transaction may distract management from executing on its business goals;\n\u2022\nincreased operating and overhead costs in the aggregate;\n\u2022\nfollowing the Spin-off, the Company\u2019s business will be less diversified than the SEACOR Holdings business prior to the Spin-off;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of synergies from the Spin-off; and\n\u2022\nthe other actions required to separate the respective businesses could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations.\nIf the Company fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Spin-off, or if such benefits are delayed, its business could be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to meet its capital needs may be harmed by the loss of financial support from SEACOR Holdings, and the lack of availability of capital in the future may affect the Company\u2019s ability to grow its business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is capital intensive, and to the extent it does not generate sufficient cash from operations, it will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to execute its growth strategy. The loss of financial support from SEACOR Holdings could harm the Company\u2019s ability to meet its capital needs and significantly increase its cost of capital. Adequate sources of capital funding may not be available when needed, or may not be available on favorable terms.\nFollowing the Spin-off, SEACOR Holdings no longer funds the Company\u2019s operations or capital expenditures. In view of the Company\u2019s small relative size as compared with SEACOR Holdings, the Company may not have access to debt financing and, even if the Company does have access, it may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as SEACOR Holdings has been able to achieve in its debt financings. As a result, the Company cannot guarantee investors that it will be able to obtain capital market financing or credit on favorable terms, or at all, in the future. The Company cannot assure investors that its ability to meet its capital needs will not be harmed by the loss of financial support from SEACOR Holdings.\nIf the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity or certain types of convertible debt securities, dilution to the holdings of its existing stockholders may result. If the Company raises additional debt financing, it will incur additional interest expense and the terms of such debt may be at less favorable rates than existing debt and could require the pledge of assets as security or subject the Company to financial and/or operating covenants that affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its business. Any capital raising activities would be subject to the restrictions in the Tax Matters Agreement. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, or the Company is unable to conduct capital raising activities as a result of restrictions in the Tax Matters Agreement, the Company may be unable to acquire additional vessels, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to\ncompetitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nIf there is a determination that the Spin-off was taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the tax opinion were incorrect or for any other reason, then SEACOR Holdings, its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and SEACOR Marine could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, SEACOR Holdings received an opinion of its counsel, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, substantially to the effect that the Spin-off qualifies as a transaction that is described in Section 355 of the Code. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from SEACOR Holdings and the Company regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect, SEACOR Holdings and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-off was taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were not correct or had been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of SEACOR Holdings or SEACOR Marine after the Spin-off. If the Spin-off is determined to be taxable, SEACOR Holdings, its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the Company could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nPrior to the Spin-off, the Company and SEACOR Holdings entered into the Tax Matters Agreement that governs the parties\u2019 respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters. Taxes relating to or arising out of the failure of the Spin-off to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes are the responsibility of SEACOR Holdings, except, in general, if such failure is attributable to the Company\u2019s action or inaction or SEACOR Holdings\u2019 action or inaction.\nThe Company\u2019s obligations under a Tax Matters Agreement are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. Further, even if the Company is not responsible for tax liabilities of SEACOR Holdings and its subsidiaries under the Tax Matters Agreement, the Company nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if SEACOR Holdings were to fail to pay them. If the Company is required to pay any liabilities under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law, the amounts may be significant.\nThe Company may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions for a period of time after the Spin-off.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to SEACOR Holdings of the Spin-off, under the Tax Matters Agreement with SEACOR Holdings, the Company may not take any action that would jeopardize the favorable tax treatment of the distribution. These restrictions may limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions that might increase the value of its business for the two-year period following the Spin-off.\nA number of the Company\u2019s directors and officers own common stock and other equity instruments of SEACOR Holdings, which could cause conflicts of interests.\nA number of the directors and officers own a substantial amount of SEACOR Holdings common stock (including restricted share awards that vested upon consummation of the Spin-off) along with other equity instruments, the value of which is related to the value of SEACOR Holdings common stock. The direct and indirect interests of the Company\u2019s directors and officers in SEACOR Holdings common stock and the presence of certain of SEACOR Holdings principal executives on the Company\u2019s board of directors could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both the Company and SEACOR Holdings that could have different implications for SEACOR Holdings than they do for the Company. As a result, the Company may be precluded from pursuing certain opportunities on which it would otherwise act, including growth opportunities.\nThe Company does not intend to adopt specific policies or procedures to address conflicts of interests that may arise as a result of certain of its directors and officers owning SEACOR Holdings common stock. The Company has adopted a Related Person Transactions Policy to provide guidance in identifying, reviewing and, where appropriate, approving or ratifying transactions with related persons. In addition, prior to consummation of the Spin-off, the Company adopted separate Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and a Supplemental Code of Ethics that will provide guidelines to its directors and officers in addressing conflicts of interest.\nThe Spin-off may expose the Company to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe Spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (i) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (ii) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer\nor is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including without limitation a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by the Company or SEACOR Holdings or any of the Company\u2019s respective subsidiaries) may bring an action alleging that the distribution or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including without limitation, voiding the Company\u2019s claims against SEACOR Holdings, requiring the Company\u2019s shareholders to return to SEACOR Holdings some or all of the shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock issued in the distribution, or providing SEACOR Holdings with a claim for money damages against the Company in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by SEACOR Holdings and the fair market value of the Company at the time of the distribution.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (i) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (ii) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (iii) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (iv) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. The Company cannot assure investors what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that the Company, SEACOR Holdings or any of the Company\u2019s respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the distribution.\nThe distribution of SEACOR Marine Common Stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), a corporation may only pay dividends to its shareholders either (i) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Although SEACOR Holdings intended to make the distribution of SEACOR Marine Common Stock entirely from surplus, the Company cannot assure investors that a court will not later determine that some or all of the distribution to SEACOR Holdings shareholders was unlawful.\nAs a condition to the distribution, the SEACOR Holdings board of directors obtained, prior to the distribution, an opinion from a nationally recognized provider of such opinions that SEACOR Holdings and the Company would each be solvent and adequately capitalized immediately after the Spin-off. The Company cannot assure investors, however, that a court would reach the same conclusions set forth in the opinion in determining whether SEACOR Holdings or the Company were insolvent at the time of, or whether lawful funds were available for the Spin-off and the distribution to SEACOR Holdings shareholders.\nRisk Factors Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly, and investors may not be able to sell their shares at an attractive price.\nThe trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock may be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors including:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s capital structure and liquidity;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices and in particular prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s quarterly financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new equipment or services by the Company or its competitors;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nsales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of the Company\u2019s Common Stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\noil and natural gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nregulatory or political developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022\nchanging economic conditions.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for the Company\u2019s Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a\nstock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of the Company\u2019s stockholders were to bring a lawsuit against it, the Company could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of the Company\u2019s management from its business.\nAn investor\u2019s percentage of ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any publicly traded company, an investor\u2019s percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that the Company has and will continue to grant to its directors, officers and employees. In addition, an investor\u2019s percentage ownership in the Company will be diluted if any of the holders of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes exercise their right to convert the principal amount of their outstanding notes, in whole or in part, into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Holders of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes are entitled to convert the principal amount of their outstanding notes into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of 23.26 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes through November 29, 2022. The Company has granted the holders of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes certain registration rights to assist them with the sale of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such notes. Any substantial issuance of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, including Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, could significantly affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about the Company\u2019s business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the Company\u2019s stock or if the Company\u2019s results of operations do not meet their expectations, the Company\u2019s stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s Common Stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about the Company or its business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to publish reports on the Company regularly, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover the Company downgrade recommendations regarding the Company\u2019s stock, or if the Company\u2019s results of operations do not meet their expectations, the Company\u2019s stock price could decline and such decline could be material.\nFor as long as the Company is \u201cEmerging Growth Company,\u201d it will be exempt from certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about its executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nIn April 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for \u201cEmerging Growth Companies,\u201d including certain requirements relating to accounting standards and compensation disclosure. The Company is classified as an \u201cEmerging Growth Company,\u201d which is defined as a company with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion, that has been a public reporting company for a period of less than five years, and that does not have a public float of $700 million or more in securities held by non-affiliated holders. For as long as the Company is an \u201cEmerging Growth Company,\u201d which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, unless the Company elects not to take advantage of applicable JOBS Act provisions, it will not be required to (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, (iii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), such as requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (iv) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, (v) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or (vi) hold stockholder advisory and other votes on executive compensation. The Company cannot predict if investors will find its Common Stock less attractive if it chooses to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Company\u2019s Common Stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for the Company\u2019s Common Stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nAs noted above, under the JOBS Act, \u201cEmerging Growth Companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company elected not to take advantage of such extended transition period, which election is irrevocable pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act.\nThe Company is obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and is subject to other requirements that will be burdensome and costly.\nThe Company has historically operated its business as a segment of a public company. As a separate company, it is required to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 of the Exchange Act. The Company is also required to ensure that it has the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, the Company is subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including the requirements of the NYSE, and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon the Company. As a public company, the Company is required to:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports and other stockholder communications in compliance with its obligations under the federal securities laws and NYSE rules;\n\u2022\ncreate or expand the roles and duties of its board of directors and committees of the board of directors;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance functions;\n\u2022\nsupplement its internal accounting and auditing function, including hiring additional staff with expertise in accounting and financial reporting for a public company;\n\u2022\nenhance and formalize closing procedures at the end of the Company\u2019s accounting periods;\n\u2022\nenhance the Company\u2019s internal audit function;\n\u2022\nenhance the Company\u2019s investor relations function;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, including those relating to disclosure controls and procedures; and\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above.\nThese changes require a significant commitment of additional resources, including increased auditing and legal fees and costs associated with hiring additional accounting and administrative staff. The Company may not be successful in fully and efficiently implementing these requirements and implementing them could materially adversely affect its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s internal controls were initially developed when it was a subsidiary of SEACOR Holdings; however, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d) requires the Company to establish effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Section 404 and to assess the effectiveness of such controls beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn connection with the preparation of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, SEACOR Holdings identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to (i) the review and approval of manual journal entries made to the general ledger and (ii) the review and documentation of assumptions, data and calculations used in the assessment of impairments of vessels and other-than-temporary impairment of equity method investments. Because the Company was previously a consolidated subsidiary of SEACOR Holdings and the Company\u2019s system of internal controls over financial reporting was part of the SEACOR Holdings control environment, the Company was deemed to have material weaknesses as well.\nWhile these previous material weaknesses were remediated, if the Company is unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, it may be unable to report its financial information on a timely basis, may violate applicable stock exchange listing rules or suffer other adverse regulatory consequences and may breach the covenants under its credit facilities. There could also be a negative reaction in the price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock due to a loss of investor confidence in the Company and the reliability of its financial statements. It cannot be assumed that the Company will not have another material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting in the future.\nMoreover, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in the Company\u2019s financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, second amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in the Company\u2019s management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of its Common Stock.\nThe Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws include certain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or changes in its management, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the ability of the Company\u2019s stockholders to fill a vacancy on the board of directors;\n\u2022\nrestrictions related to the ability of non-U.S. citizens owning the Company\u2019s Common Stock;\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the board of directors may determine, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors which may limit the ability of minority stockholders to elect directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from soliciting proxies to elect a particular slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions in the Company\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company that is in the best interest of its stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nThe Company\u2019s second amended and restated by-laws provide that, unless the Company otherwise consents in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or employee of the Company to itself or to its stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThe Company\u2019s second amended and restated by-laws provide that, unless the Company otherwise consents in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or employee of the Company to itself or to its stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, employees or other stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers, employees or other stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision in the Company\u2019s second amended and restated by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition.\nThe Company does not expect to pay dividends to holders of its Common Stock.\nThe Company currently intends to retain its future earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future, to repay indebtedness and to fund the development and growth of its business. The Company does not intend to pay any dividends to holders of its Common Stock. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, if any, will be investor\u2019s only source of gain or income on an investment in the Company\u2019s Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 16737, "SIC": 4412, "TIC": "SMHI"}
