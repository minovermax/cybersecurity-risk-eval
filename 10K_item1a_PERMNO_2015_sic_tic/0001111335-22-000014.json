{"cik": "1111335", "company": "VISTEON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Risks attributable to all registrants are not included below. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those not presently known or that the Company believes to be immaterial, also may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Should any such risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nOperations Related Risk Factors\nThe Company could be negatively impacted by the supplier shortages, other supplier distress, or suppliers pricing increases\nIn an effort to manage and reduce the costs of purchased goods and services, the Company, like many suppliers and automakers, has been consolidating its supply base. As a result, the Company is dependent on single or limited sources of supply for certain components used in the manufacture of its products including semiconductor chips which are integral components of new vehicles and are embedded in multiple vehicle systems including automotive and cockpit electronics. In 2021, the Company experienced semiconductor shortages and expects such shortages to continue in 2022. If such shortages of semiconductors or other critical components from other suppliers continue longer than anticipated, or worsen, it will impact the Company's ability to meet its production schedules for some of its key products or to ship such products to its customers in a timely fashion. Furthermore, unfavorable economic or industry conditions could result in financial distress within the Company's supply base, thereby increasing the risk of supply disruption.\nSuch disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems, such as closures of one of the Company\u2019s or its suppliers\u2019 plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, or political upheaval, as well as logistical complications due to weather, global climate change, volcanic eruptions, or other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, delayed customs processing, the spread of an infectious disease, virus or other widespread illness and more. Additionally, as the Company grows in best cost countries, the risk for such disruptions is heightened. The lack of even a single small subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of the Company\u2019s products, for whatever reason, could force the Company to cease production, even for a prolonged period. Similarly, a potential quality issue could force the Company to halt deliveries while it validates the products. Even where products are ready to be shipped, or have been shipped, delays may arise before they reach the customer. The Company\u2019s customers may halt or delay production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components. This may cause the Company\u2019s customers, in turn to suspend their orders, or instruct us to suspend delivery, of our products, which may adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf the Company were to fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with contractual obligations, the Company generally must absorb its own costs for identifying and solving the \u201croot cause\u201d problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products. Generally, the Company must also carry the costs associated with \u201ccatching up,\u201d such as overtime and premium freight. Additionally, if the Company is the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from the Company. These losses and expenses could be significant, and may include consequential losses such as lost profits. Any supply-chain disruption, however small, could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of the Company\u2019s customers, and any such shutdown could lead to material claims of compensation.\nThe Company continues to work closely with suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of the semiconductor supply shortage and monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials, customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise, due to this or any\nother issue. However, if the Company is not able to mitigate the semiconductor shortage impact, any direct or indirect supply chain disruptions may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company has experienced and may in the future experience supplier price increases that could negatively affect our operations and profitability. The price increases are often driven by raw material pricing and availability, component or part availability, manufacturing capacity, industry allocations, logistics capacity, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change, and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that the Company or its affiliates and joint ventures, employees, suppliers, customers, and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions, and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. In addition, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions or delays in our supply chain as a result of such actions, which is likely to result in higher supply chain costs to us in order to maintain the supply of materials and components for our products. While the Company has implemented measures to mitigate the impact on its results of operations, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. The Company cannot predict the degree to which, or the period over which, its financials and operations will be affected by this outbreak and preventative measures, and the effects could be material.\nThe Company may also experience impacts from market downturns and changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears and impacts on its workforce as a result of COVID-19. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak continues to impact the Company\u2019s financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19, mutation of COVID-19 variants, and the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the Company may continue to experience adverse impacts on its business and financial performance as a result of its global economic impact. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affects the Company\u2019s business and financial results, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with the Company\u2019s business, liquidity, and indebtedness.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial international operations make it vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries\nThe Company has manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign locations. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022changes to international trade agreements;\n\u2022local economic conditions, expropriation and nationalization, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and currency controls;\n\u2022withholding, border, and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022investment restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022export and import restrictions, including increases in border tariffs;\n\u2022the ability to effectively enforce intellectual property rights;\n\u2022new or additional governmental sanctions on doing business with or in certain countries or with certain persons; and\n\u2022increases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s global operations may also be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events, and hostilities or complications due to natural or other disasters. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in Mexico, China, or other countries in which the Company operates or where its suppliers are located could result in social, economic, and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDespite recent trade negotiations between the U.S. and Chinese governments and between the U.S. and European governments, given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the imposed tariffs, as well as the potential for additional tariffs or\ntrade barriers by the U.S., China or other countries, the Company can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful.\nThe Company has invested significantly and is expected to continue to invest significantly in joint ventures with other parties to conduct business in China and elsewhere in Asia. These investments may include manufacturing operations, and technical centers as well as research and development activities, to support anticipated growth in the region. If the Company is not able to strengthen existing relationships, secure additional customers, and develop market-relevant electrification, advanced driver assistance and autonomous vehicle technologies, it may fail to realize expected rates of return on these investments. The Company\u2019s ability to repatriate funds from these joint ventures depends not only upon their uncertain cash flows and profits but also upon the terms of particular agreements with the Company\u2019s joint venture partners and maintenance of the legal and political status quo. As a result, the Company\u2019s exposure to the risks described above is substantial. The likelihood of such occurrences and its potential effect on the Company vary from country to country and are unpredictable. However, any such occurrences could be harmful to the Company\u2019s business, profitability, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to effectively operate could be hindered if it fails to attract and retain key personnel\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate its business and implement its strategies effectively depends, in part, on the efforts of its executive officers and other key employees. In addition, the Company\u2019s future success will depend on, among other factors, the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly engineers and other employees with critical expertise and skills that support key customers and products or in emerging regions. The loss of the services of any key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may incur significant restructuring charges\nThe Company has taken, and expects to take, restructuring actions to realign its engineering organization and to realign and resize its production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements. The extent to which these strategies will achieve the desired efficiencies and goals in 2022 and beyond is uncertain because their success depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Charges related to these actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. Moreover, there can be no assurances that any future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results.\nWork stoppages and similar events could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s business\nBecause the automotive industry relies heavily on just-in-time delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, a work stoppage at one or more of the Company\u2019s manufacturing and assembly facilities could have material adverse effects on the business. Similarly, if one or more of the Company\u2019s customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of the Company\u2019s products, which could result in the shutdown of the related manufacturing facilities. A significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage at one of the Company\u2019s suppliers or any other supplier could have the same consequences, and accordingly, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nIndustry and Competition Related Risk Factors\nThe Company may not realize sales represented by awarded business\nThe Company estimates awarded business using certain assumptions, including projected future sales volumes. The OEM customers generally do not guarantee production volumes. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that OEM customers have the right to terminate without penalty. Therefore, the Company\u2019s actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that it derives from such sales, are not committed. If actual production orders from its customers are not consistent with the projections used by the Company in calculating the amount of its awarded business, the Company could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the projected estimate.\nThe Company must continue to develop, introduce, and achieve market acceptance of new and enhanced products in order to grow its sales in the future\nThe growth of the Company's business will be dependent on the demand for innovative automotive electronics products, including but not limited to electrification, advanced driver assistance and autonomous vehicle technologies. In order to increase sales in current markets and gain entry into new markets, the Company must innovate to maintain and improve existing products, including software, while successfully developing and introducing distinctive new and enhanced products that anticipate changing customer and consumer preferences and capitalize upon emerging software technologies. However, the Company may experience difficulties that delay or prevent the development, introduction, or market acceptance of its new or enhanced products, or undiscovered software errors, bugs, and defects in its products may injure the Company's reputation. Furthermore, these new technologies have also attracted increased competition from outside the traditional automotive industry, and any of these competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance, which could adversely affect the future growth of the Company.\nThe automotive industry is cyclical and significant declines in the production levels of the Company\u2019s major customers could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm its profitability\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products is directly related to the automotive vehicle production of the Company\u2019s major customers. Automotive sales and production are cyclical and can be affected by general economic or industry conditions, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the cost and availability of credit, and other factors. Due to overall global economic conditions, including semiconductor shortages, in 2021, the automotive industry experienced constrained production schedules.\nThe discontinuation or loss of business, or lack of commercial success, with respect to a particular product for which the Company is a significant supplier could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm its profitability\nAlthough the Company has purchase orders from many of its customers, these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer\u2019s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, or in some cases, for the supply of a customer\u2019s requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. In addition, certain customers have communicated an intent to manufacture components internally that are currently produced by outside suppliers, such as the Company. If the Company's OEM customers successfully insource products currently manufactured by the Company the discontinuation or loss of business for products which the Company is a significant supplier could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and harm the Company\u2019s profitability.\nEscalating price pressures from customers may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business\nDownward pricing pressures by automotive manufacturers, while characteristic of the automotive industry, are increasing. Virtually all automakers have implemented aggressive price-reduction initiatives and objectives each year with their suppliers, and such actions are expected to continue in the future. In addition, estimating such amounts is subject to risk and uncertainties because any price reductions are a result of negotiations and other factors. Accordingly, suppliers must be able to reduce their operating costs in order to maintain profitability. The Company has taken steps to reduce its operating costs and other actions to offset customer price reductions; however, price reductions have impacted the Company\u2019s sales and profit margins and are expected to continue to do so in the future. If the Company is unable to offset customer price reductions in the future through improved operating efficiencies, new manufacturing processes, sourcing alternatives, and other cost-reduction initiatives, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition will likely be adversely affected.\nThe Company is highly dependent on Ford Motor Company and decreases in this customer\u2019s vehicle production volumes would adversely affect the Company\nFord is one of the Company\u2019s largest ultimate customers and accounted for 22% of sales for each of the years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, any change in Ford's vehicle production volumes may have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s sales volume and profitability.\nProduct Related Risk Factors\nThe Company's inability to effectively manage the timing, quality, and costs of new program launches could adversely affect its financial performance\nIn connection with the award of new business, the Company often obligates itself to deliver new products and services that are subject to its customers\u2019 timing, performance, and quality standards. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, the Company must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order to launch programs successfully. Given the complexity of new program launches, especially involving new and innovative technologies, the Company may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness, and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, the sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of the introduction of new vehicles by the Company's customers. The Company's inability to effectively manage the timing, quality, and costs of these new program launches could adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows from operations.\nWarranty claims, product liability claims, and product recalls could harm the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition\nThe Company faces the inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that its products fail to perform as expected or such failure results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). In addition, if any of the Company\u2019s designed products are defective or are alleged to be defective, the Company may be required to participate in a recall campaign. The Company\u2019s products contain increasingly significant amounts of software and a successful cyberattack on such products could cause materially adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and reputation. In addition, as the Company expands its electrification product offering such products may present a different risk profile. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, automakers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to suppliers for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. A successful warranty or product liability claim against the Company, or a requirement that the Company participate in a product recall campaign, could have materially adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDevelopments or assertions by or against the Company relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact its business\nThe Company owns significant intellectual property, including a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements. The Company\u2019s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position in a number of the markets served. The Company may utilize intellectual property in its products that requires a license from a third-party. While the Company believes that such licenses generally can be obtained, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property could preclude the Company from selling certain products and have materially adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Developments or assertions by or against the Company relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company also derives significant revenue from countries outside the U.S. (including China) and significant intellectual property assets are licensed to joint ventures and customers in foreign jurisdictions. While the Company is not aware of any material intellectual property theft or forced transfer and believes it has appropriate protections in place, if such action were to occur it could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the Company has continued to see an increase in patent claims related to connectivity-enabled products where other patent-holding companies are seeking royalties and often enter into litigation based on patent infringement allegations. Significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nPrivacy and security concerns relating to the Company's current or future products and services could damage its reputation and deter current and potential users from using them\nThe Company may gain access to sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Concerns about the Company's practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage its reputation and adversely affect its operating results.\nFurthermore, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning cybersecurity and data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. Complying with these various laws could cause the Company to incur substantial costs.\nTax Related Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and could materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and tax audits.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions. Changes in tax rates or tax laws by U.S. and international jurisdictions and tax audits could adversely impact Visteon\u2019s financial results. The Company is in a position whereby losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions generally provide no current financial statement benefit. In addition, certain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the United States statutory rate. As such, changes in the mix and source of earnings between jurisdictions, including changes in tax rates in those jurisdictions, could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate in future periods. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions could also open new examinations and expand existing examinations for which the outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty. Furthermore, changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, could also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective rate in future periods.\nThe Company may not be able to fully utilize its U.S. net operating losses and other tax attributes\nThe Company has net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and other tax attributes which could be limited if there is a subsequent change of ownership. If the Company were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of IRC Sections 382 and 383, its NOLs and other tax attributes could be limited to an amount equal to its market capitalization at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long-term tax exempt rate. The Company cannot provide any assurance that such an ownership change will not occur, in which case the availability of the Company's NOLs and other tax attributes could be significantly limited or possibly eliminated. Certain tax benefit preservation provisions of its corporate documents could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to stockholders.\nThe Company may not be able to fully utilize its U.S. net operating losses and other tax attributes\nThe Company has net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and other tax attributes which could be limited if there is a subsequent change of ownership. If the Company were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of IRC Sections 382 and 383, its NOLs and other tax attributes could be limited to an amount equal to its market capitalization at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the federal long-term tax exempt rate. The Company cannot provide any assurance that such an ownership change will not occur, in which case the availability of the Company's NOLs and other tax attributes could be significantly limited or possibly eliminated. Certain tax benefit preservation provisions of its corporate documents could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that change would be beneficial to stockholders.\nMarket Related Risk Factors\nThe Company is subject to significant foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure\nAs a result of Visteon's global presence, a significant portion of the Company's revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure. The Company's primary exposures are to the euro, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, Indian rupee, and Bulgarian lev. While the Company employs financial instruments to mitigate transactional foreign exchange exposure, including multi-year contracts, exchange rates are difficult to predict, and such actions may not completely insulate the Company from those exposures. As a result, volatility in certain exchange rates could adversely impact Visteon financial results and comparability of results from period to period.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA disruption in the Company's information technology systems could adversely affect its business and financial performance\nThe Company relies on the accuracy, capacity, and security of its information technology systems as well as those of its customers, suppliers, partners, and service providers to conduct its business. Despite the security and risk-prevention measures the Company has implemented, the Company's systems could be breached, damaged, or otherwise interrupted by a system failure, cyber-attack, malicious computer software (malware), unauthorized physical or electronic access, or other natural or\nman-made incidents or disasters. The Company is also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected. Such a breach or interruption could result in business disruption, theft of the Company intellectual property or trade secrets, and unauthorized access to personal information. To the extent that business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed, or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitive position, relationships with customers, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nThe Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes, which could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial position\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes (including disputes with suppliers), intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, and employment matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial position.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and markets\nIncreased attention to climate change and its association with greenhouse gas emissions, expectations for companies to establish short and long-term emissions reduction targets, and changes in consumer preferences may result in increased costs, reduced profits, risks associated with new regulatory requirements and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigations. The U.S. federal government, certain U.S. states, and certain other countries and regions have adopted or are considering legislation or regulation imposing overall caps or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions from certain sectors including automotive. Failure to comply with any legislation or regulation could potentially result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, or operational changes. Moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, increased awareness of, or any adverse publicity regarding, the effects of greenhouse gases could harm the Company\u2019s reputation or reduce customer demand for our products and services.\nAdditionally, as severe weather events become increasingly common, operations of the Company, its customers, and/or suppliers may be disrupted, which could result in increased operational costs or reduced demand for products and services. While the Company has invested in administration of programs and physical loss prevention improvements to mitigate the risk of natural disasters causing disruption to its ability to serve its customers and communities in times of need, extended periods of disruptions could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s pension expense and funding levels of pension plans could materially deteriorate, or the Company may be unable to generate sufficient excess cash flow to meet increased pension benefit obligations\nThe Company\u2019s assumptions used to calculate pension obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. While the Company\u2019s management believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Company\u2019s pension obligations and future expense. For more information on sensitivities to changing assumptions, please see \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Item 7 and Note 12, \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.", "PERMNO": 88319, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "VC"}
