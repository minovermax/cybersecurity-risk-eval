{"cik": "861459", "company": "GRANITE CONSTRUCTION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business. Volatility in the global financial system, deterioration in general economic activity, and fiscal, monetary and other policies that the federal, state and local government(s) may enact, including infrastructure spending or deficit reduction measures, may have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In particular, low tax revenues, budget deficits, financing constraints, including timing of long-term federal, state and local funding releases, and competing priorities could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new infrastructure projects in the public sector. In addition, these factors could have a material adverse effect on the financial market and economic conditions in the United States as well as throughout the world, which may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to obtain financing and/or could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy. In addition, levels of new commercial and residential construction projects could be adversely affected by oversupply of existing inventories of commercial and residential properties, low property values and a restrictive financing environment.\n\u2022\nWe work in a highly competitive marketplace. We have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work, and some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater resources than we do. Government funding for public works projects is limited, thus contributing to competition for the limited number of public projects available. This increased competition may result in a decrease in new awards at acceptable profit margins. In addition, should downturns in residential and commercial construction activity occur, the competition for available public sector work would intensify, which could impact our revenue, contract backlog and profit margins.\n\u2022\nGovernment contracts generally have strict regulatory requirements. Approximately 80.3% of our construction related revenue in 2018 was derived from contracts funded by federal, state and local government agencies and authorities. Government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting and often include express or implied certifications of compliance. Claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought for violations of regulations, requirements or statutes. We may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of the regulations, requirements or statutes or if we have a substantial number of accumulated Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Mine Safety and Health Administration or other workplace safety violations, our existing government contracts could be terminated and we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. Should one or more of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nGovernment contractors are subject to suspension or debarment from government contracting. Our substantial dependence on government contracts exposes us to a variety of risks that differ from those associated with private sector contracts. Various statutes to which our operations are subject, including the Davis-Bacon Act (which regulates wages and benefits), the Walsh-Healy Act (which prescribes a minimum wage and regulates overtime and working conditions), Executive Order 11246 (which establishes equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements) and the Drug-Free Workplace Act, provide for mandatory suspension and/or debarment of contractors in certain circumstances involving statutory violations. In addition, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and various state statutes provide for discretionary suspension and/or debarment in certain circumstances that might call into question a contractor\u2019s willingness or ability to act responsibly, including as a result of being convicted of, or being found civilly liable for, fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain or performing a public contract or subcontract. The scope and duration of any suspension or debarment may vary depending upon the facts and the statutory or regulatory grounds for debarment and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel, joint venture partners and subcontractors in a competitive environment. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel, joint venture partners, advisors and subcontractors. Changes in general or local economic conditions and the resulting impact on the labor market and on our joint venture partners may make it difficult to attract or retain qualified individuals in the geographic areas where we perform our work. If we are unable to provide competitive compensation packages, high-quality training programs and attractive work environments or to establish and maintain successful partnerships, our reputation, relationships and/or ability to profitably execute our work could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses. Construction and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces and often put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. On many sites, we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. If we fail to implement these procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, we may suffer the loss of or injury to our employees, as well as expose ourselves to possible litigation. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards through our safety programs could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nIn connection with acquisitions or divestitures, we may become subject to liabilities. In connection with any acquisitions, we may acquire liabilities or defects such as legal claims, including but not limited to third party liability and other tort claims; claims for breach of contract; employment-related claims; environmental liabilities, conditions or damage; permitting, regulatory or other compliance with law issues; or tax liabilities. If we acquire any of these liabilities, and they are not adequately covered by insurance or an enforceable indemnity or similar agreement from a creditworthy counterparty, we may be responsible for significant out-of-pocket expenditures. In connection with any divestitures, we may incur liabilities for breaches of representations and warranties or failure to comply with operating covenants under any agreement for a divestiture. In addition, we may indemnify a counterparty in a divestiture for certain liabilities of the subsidiary or operation s subject to the divestiture transaction. These liabilities, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nAs a part of our growth strategy we have made and may make future acquisitions, and acquisitions involve many risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing operations;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties and increased costs associated with completion of any assumed construction projects;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated;\n\u2022\ndifficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities;\n\u2022\nincreased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business;\n\u2022\nif we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders\u2019 individual ownership percentages in the Company;\n\u2022\nthe recording of goodwill or other non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to subsequent impairment testing and potential impairment charges, as well as amortization expenses related to certain other intangible assets; and\n\u2022\nwhile we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity.\nFailure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nAn inability to obtain bonding could have a negative impact on our operations and results. As more fully described in \u201cInsurance and Bonding\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d we generally are required to provide surety bonds securing our performance under the majority of our public and private sector contracts. Our inability to obtain reasonably priced surety bonds in the future and, while we monitor the financial health of our insurers and the insurance market, catastrophic events could reduce available limits or the breadth of coverage both of which could significantly affect our ability to be awarded new contracts and could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (\u201cDBE\u201d) contractors to perform as subcontractors. Certain of our government agency projects contain minimum DBE participation clauses. If we subsequently fail to complete these projects with the minimum DBE participation, we may be held responsible for breach of contract, which may include restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects as well as monetary damages. To the extent we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nFixed price and fixed unit price contracts subject us to the risk of increased project cost. As more fully described in \u201cContract Provisions and Subcontracting\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d the profitability of our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid. This could result in reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nDesign-build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions. Design-build is increasingly being used as a method of project delivery as it provides the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. We generally subcontract design responsibility to architectural and engineering firms. However, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the subcontractor or their errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the liability. In this case we may be responsible, resulting in a potentially material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nMany of our contracts have penalties for late completion. In some instances, including many of our fixed price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. To the extent these events occur, the total cost of the project could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profits or a loss on that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nStrikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results. We are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of our craft workforce. Although strikes or work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our operations or results in the past, such labor actions could have a significant impact on our operations and results if they occur in the future.\n\u2022\nFailure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results. As further described in \u201cContract Provisions and Subcontracting\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d we subcontract portions of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors, but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work. Although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees, we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our higher-risk subcontractors. In this case we may be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated, resulting in a potentially adverse impact on our cash flows and liquidity. In addition, the total costs of a project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur joint venture contracts subject us to risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside of our control. As further described in Note 1 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d and under \u201cItem 1. Business; Joint Ventures,\u201d we perform certain construction contracts as a limited member of joint ventures. Participating in these arrangements exposes us to risks and uncertainties, including the risk that if our partners fail to perform under joint and several liability contracts, we could be liable for completion of the entire contract. In addition, if our partners are not able or willing to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture, there could be unanticipated costs to complete the projects, financial penalties or liquidated damages. These situations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nTo the extent we are not the controlling partner, we have limited control over many of the decisions made with respect to the related construction projects. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same compliance requirements, including those related to internal control over financial reporting. While we have controls to sufficiently mitigate the risks associated with reliance on their control environment and financial information, to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur failure to adequately recover on affirmative claims brought by us against project owners or other project participants (e.g., back charges against subcontractors) for additional contract costs could have a negative impact on our liquidity and future operations. In certain circumstances, we assert affirmative claims against project owners, engineers, consultants, subcontractors or others involved in a project for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of affirmative claims occur due to matters such as delays or changes from the initial project scope, both of which may result in additional costs. Often, these affirmative claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when and on what terms they will be fully resolved. The potential gross profit impact of recoveries for affirmative claims may be material in future periods when they, or a portion of them, become probable and estimable or are settled. When these types of events occur, we use working capital to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant affirmative claims and may incur additional costs when pursuing such potential recoveries. A failure to recover on these types of affirmative claims promptly and fully could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In addition, while clients and subcontractors may be obligated to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us.\n\u2022\nFailure to remain in compliance with covenants under our debt and credit agreements, service our indebtedness, or fund our other liquidity needs could adversely impact our business. Our debt and credit agreements and related restrictive and financial covenants are more fully described in Note 15 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d Our failure to comply with any of these covenants, or to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due thereunder, would constitute an event of default under the applicable agreements. Under certain circumstances, the occurrence of an event of default under one of our debt or credit agreements (or the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness under one of our agreements) may constitute an event of default under one or more of our other debt or credit agreements. Default under our debt and credit agreements could result in (i) us no longer being entitled to borrow under the agreements; (ii) termination of the agreements; (iii) the requirement that any letters of credit under the agreements be cash collateralized; (iv) acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreements; and/or (v) foreclosure on any lien securing the obligations under the agreements. If we are unable to service our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we could be forced to curtail our operations, reorganize our capital structure (including through bankruptcy proceedings) or liquidate some or all of our assets in a manner that could cause holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investment in us.\n\u2022\nUnavailability of insurance coverage could have a negative effect on our operations and results. We maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements to maintain specific coverage that are contained in our financing agreements and in most of our construction contracts. Although we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future, and our inability to obtain such coverage could have an adverse impact on our ability to procure new work, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nAccounting for our revenues and costs involves significant estimates. As further described in \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d accounting for our contract-related revenues and costs, as well as other expenses, requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. Although we believe we have sufficient experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profit. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\n\u2022\nWe use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations. Petroleum based products, such as fuels, lubricants, and liquid asphalt, are used to power or lubricate our equipment, operate our plants, and a significant ingredient in the asphaltic concrete we manufacture for sale to third parties and use in our asphalt paving construction projects. Although we are partially protected by asphalt or fuel price escalation clauses in some of our contracts, many contracts provide no such protection. We also use steel and other commodities in our construction projects that can be subject to significant price fluctuations. To mitigate these risks, we pre-purchase commodities, enter into supply agreements or enter into financial contracts to secure pricing. Although we have not been significantly adversely affected by price fluctuations in the past, there is no guarantee that we will not be in the future.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to environmental and other regulation. As more fully described in \u201cEnvironmental Regulations\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d we are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, workplace safety and a variety of socioeconomic requirements. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties, or termination or suspension of government contracts as well as civil and criminal liability. In addition, some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites, without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. We occasionally evaluate various alternatives with respect to our facilities, including possible dispositions or closures. Investigations undertaken in connection with these activities may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated, and closures of facilities may trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities. While compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that existing or future circumstances or developments with respect to contamination will not require us to make significant remediation or restoration expenditures.\n\u2022\nWeather can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. Our ability to perform work is significantly affected by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Changes in weather conditions can cause delays and otherwise significantly affect our project costs. The impact of weather conditions can result in variability in our quarterly revenues and profitability, particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year.\n\u2022\nIncreasing restrictions on securing aggregate reserves could negatively affect our future operations and results. Tighter regulations and the finite nature of property containing suitable aggregate reserves are making it increasingly challenging and costly to secure aggregate reserves. Although we have thus far been able to secure reserves to support our business, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by an increasingly difficult permitting process.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to contribute cash to meet our unfunded pension obligations in certain multi-employer plans. Five of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Granite Construction Company, Granite Construction Northeast, Inc., Granite Industrial, Inc., Kenny Construction Company and Layne Christensen Company participate in various domestic multi-employer pension plans on behalf of union employees. Union employee benefits generally are based on a fixed amount for each year of service. We are required to make contributions to the plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense is recognized as contributions are made. The domestic pension plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). Under ERISA, a contributor to a multi-employer plan may be liable, upon termination or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of a plan\u2019s unfunded vested liability. While we currently have no intention of withdrawing from a plan and unfunded pension obligations have not significantly affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to make material cash contributions to one or more of these plans to satisfy certain underfunded benefit obligations in the future.\n\u2022\nForce majeure events, including natural disasters and terrorists\u2019 actions, could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Force majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters, as well as terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate. We typically negotiate contract language where we are allowed certain relief from force majeure events in private client contracts and review and attempt to mitigate force majeure events in both public and private client contracts. We remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events subject to relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure events, our operations may be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nChanges to our outsourced software or infrastructure vendors as well as any sudden loss, breach of security, disruption or unexpected data or vendor loss associated with our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on third-party software and infrastructure to run critical accounting, project management and financial information systems. If software or infrastructure vendors decide to discontinue further development, integration or long-term maintenance support for our information systems, or there is any system interruption, delay, breach of security, loss of data or loss of a vendor, we may need to migrate some or all of our accounting, project management and financial information to other systems. Despite business continuity plans, these disruptions could increase our operational expense as well as impact the management of our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nCybersecurity attacks on or breaches of our information technology environment could result in business interruptions, remediation costs and/or legal claims. To protect confidential customer, vendor, financial and employee information, we employ information security measures that secure our information systems from cybersecurity attacks or breaches. Even with these measures, we may be subject to unauthorized access of digital data with the intent to misappropriate information, corrupt data or cause operational disruptions. If a failure of our safeguarding measures were to occur, it could have a negative impact to our business and result in business interruptions, remediation costs and/or legal claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nA change in tax laws or regulations of any federal, state or international jurisdiction in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal, state, local and international legislative proposals that could result in a material increase to our U.S. federal, state, local and/or international taxes. We cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing regulations, the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing our cost of tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in our contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may adversely affect the revenue and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.\n\u2022\nOur business strategy includes growing our international operations, which are subject to a number of special risks. As part of our strategic diversification efforts, we may enter into more construction contracts in international locations, which may subject us to a number of special risks unique to foreign countries and/or operations. Due to the special risks associated with non-U.S. operations, our exposure to such risks may not be proportionate to the percentage of our revenues attributable to such operations.\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and any determination that we or any of our subsidiaries has violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their affiliates from making improper payment to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies, procedures and code of conduct mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. However, with the acquisition of Layne we now operate in some countries known to experience corruption. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot provide assurance that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violation of such anti-corruption laws committed by our affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of certain of our assets. Our customers in those jurisdictions could also seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interest. In addition, we could face other third-party claims by among others, our stockholders, debt holders or other interest holders or constituents. Violations of FCPA laws, allegations of such violations and/or disclosure related to any relevant investigation could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity for reasons including, but not limited to, an adverse effect our reputation, our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business, to attract and retain employees, to access the capital markets and/or could give rise to an event of default under the agreements governing our debt instruments.\n\u2022\nRising inflation and/or interest rates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates, could have a negative impact on our business. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe foregoing list is not all-inclusive. There can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. These developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 76135, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "GVA"}
