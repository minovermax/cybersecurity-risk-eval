You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes thereto. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us and impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the events or developments discussed in the risk factors below could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and in such case, our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. If any of such events or developments were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nSummary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described below, that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our common stock risky include, among others:\n\u2022the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022our ability to sustain profitability, and raise capital;\n\u2022our ability to accurately forecast our operating results and growth rate or manage our growth effectively;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our brand image, engage new and existing customers and gain market share;\n\u2022our ability to compete successfully;\n\u2022our ability to effectively market and launch our products and increase customer traffic;\n\u2022our ability to attract, develop, motivate and maintain well-qualified associates;\n\u2022systems interruptions that impair customer access to our sites or other performance failures in our technology infrastructure, including significant disruptions of or breach in security of information technology systems and violation of data privacy laws;\n\u2022any decline in consumer spending including due to negative impact from economic conditions;\n\u2022our dependence on a small number of suppliers, including international suppliers and those in developing countries, foreign manufacturing and imports;\n\u2022the impact of increases in demand for, or the price of, raw materials used to manufacture our products;\n\u2022our inability to manage our inventory levels and products, including the complexities created by our omni-channel operations, and sustain our Internet sales levels;\n\u2022our ability to successfully open and operate new showrooms and continue to achieve showroom growth rates that we have achieved in the past;\n\u2022our ability to successfully adapt to consumer shopping preferences;\n\u2022unfavorable changes to government regulation of the Internet and ecommerce; and\n\u2022our ability to protect our trademarks, brand image, or other intellectual property rights.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe impact of COVID-19 continues to create uncertainty for our business and may have a significant negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, particularly retail operations, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments take increasingly broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis. We have experienced significant disruption to our business, both in terms of disruption of our operations and the adverse effect on overall economic conditions. On March 18, 2020, the Company closed all showroom locations. All of our showrooms have since fully reopened to the walk-in phase; however, there is no guarantee that there will not be additional closures. We have seen and may continue to see changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, including the inability of consumers to purchase our products due to factors such as quarantine or other restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship. To help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on showroom and in-person sales, we have increased marketing of our website and ecommerce platform as we believe that the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce to online sales. However, it is possible that this increased ecommerce demand may not continue in future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside, which could adversely affect our revenue growth. Our business is also dependent on the continued health and productivity of our associates, including store, region and corporate management teams, throughout this crisis. Although we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates, our employees may be exposed to COVID-19, and we may face claims by such employees or regulatory authorities that we have not provided adequate protection to our employees with respect to the spread of COVID-19 at our physical locations, which may affect our business, results of operations, and reputation. Our global supply chain and manufacturing operations may also be impacted by COVID-19 related constraints, such as lock-down orders and business limitations imposed on our third-party suppliers. Individually and collectively, the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, and meet our financial obligations. The capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the crisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors. Depending on the continued impact of the crisis, further actions may be required.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 ultimately impacts our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the virus and any variants, its severity, the vaccination rates among the population and its\neffectiveness, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. For example, significant shifts in consumer spending behavior resulting from the outbreak, especially around key purchase triggers like moving into new dwellings, remodeling spaces, or replacing or upgrading home furnishings, which we believe increased our sales during the pandemic, may decline after the pandemic has abated and cause a significant impact on our business and operations.\nThe various United States federal government orders and regulations directing employers to require their employees to be vaccinated could lead to labor disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOn November 4, 2021, the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) issued an emergency temporary standard (\u201cETS\u201d) requiring private employers with 100 or more employees to enforce vaccination mandates for its employees or, alternatively, require weekly testing. On January 13, 2022, the United States Supreme Court issued an opinion staying enforcement of the ETS. Then, effective January 26, 2022, OSHA withdrew the ETS as an enforceable ETS, but did not withdraw the ETS as a proposed rule. The ultimate outcome of this proposed rule and related litigation cannot be determined at this time. We are continuing to closely monitor and update our practices in response to developments or changes in the COVID-19 vaccination policies established by various federal agencies as well as the several state-specific COVID-19 vaccine mandates that provide expanded exemptions, modifications, or restrictions regarding employee vaccinations. Given current information, it is not possible to assess with certainty the impact such vaccine mandates would have on us. These mandates may result in increased costs, labor disruptions or employee attrition. If we lose employees, it will be difficult in the current competitive labor market to find qualified replacement employees, and this could have an adverse effect on future revenues and costs, which could be material. Additional uncertainty could also be caused by competing and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, such as the recent executive orders issued by certain states prohibiting vaccine mandates. Accordingly, such mandates could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBusiness Risks\nOur inability to maintain our brand image, engage new and existing customers and gain market share could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur ability to maintain our brand image and reputation is integral to our business and implementation of our growth strategy. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brand will depend largely on the success of our design, merchandising and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality product and customer experience. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for product quality and integrity and any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our products. There is also increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, and other stakeholders, on corporate social responsibility and sustainability matters. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to any social or sustainability matters, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. While we believe our brand enjoys a loyal customer base, the success of our growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to keep existing customers engaged and attract new customers to our brand. If we experience damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence, we may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf we fail to acquire new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, we may not be able to achieve revenue growth or profitability.\nTo acquire new customers, we must appeal to prospects who have historically used other means of commerce to purchase furniture, such as traditional furniture retailers. To date, we have reached new customers primarily through our showroom presence in various markets, and through social media, digital content, third-party advocates for our brand and products and by word of mouth, and now through national television advertisements. Until now, these efforts have allowed us to acquire new customers at what we believe is a reasonable cost and rate. However, there is no guarantee that these methods will continue to be successful, will not be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, or will drive customer acquisition rates necessary for us to achieve revenue growth or profitability.\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nOur business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries. We compete with furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores, specialty retailers and online furniture retailers and marketplaces.\nWe expect competition in both retail stores and ecommerce to continue to increase. Our ability to compete successfully depends on many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the size and composition of our customer base;\n\u2022our selling and marketing efforts;\n\u2022the quality, price, reliability and uniqueness of products we offer;\n\u2022the convenience of the shopping experience that we provide;\n\u2022our ability to distribute our products and manage our operations; and\n\u2022our reputation and brand strength.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technological capabilities, faster and less costly shipping, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to, among other things, derive greater sales from their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs and respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer habits. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on the performance of members of management and highly skilled personnel. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate and retain well-qualified associates, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of Shawn Nelson, our founder, member of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Mary Fox, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Jack Krause, our Chief Strategy Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, Donna Dellomo, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary and other members of our management team. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled associates. The market for such associates in the cities in which we operate is competitive. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. The loss of any of our key associates, including members of our senior management team, could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. Our inability to recruit and develop mid-level managers could have similar adverse effects on our ability to execute our business plan.\nSome of our officers and other key associates are employed at-will, meaning that they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. While others have employment agreements with stated terms, they could still leave our employ. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating existing associates or attracting well-qualified associates, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nSystem interruptions that impair customer access to our sites or other performance failures in our technology infrastructure could damage our business, reputation and brand, and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our website, transaction processing systems and technology infrastructure are critical to our reputation, and our ability to acquire and retain customers and maintain adequate customer service levels. We currently rely on a variety of third party service providers to support mission critical systems and the efficient flow of merchandise from and between warehouses and showrooms to customers. For example, we rely on common carriers for the delivery of merchandise purchased by customers through our website and in our showrooms, and the systems we employ to communicate delivery schedules and update customers about order tracking interface with the information systems of these common carriers. Our own systems, which are customized versions of ecommerce, customer\nrelationship management, payment processing, and inventory management software technologies deployed by numerous retailers and wholesalers in a variety of industries, must work seamlessly in order for information to flow correctly and update accurately across these systems. Any failure in this regard could result in negative customer experiences, putting our brand and growth at risk.\nThrough third parties that underwrite customer risk, we offer financing options in order to increase the market demand for our products among customers who may not be able to buy them using cash. The systems of these third parties must work efficiently in order to give customers real-time credit availability. Changes in the risk underwriting or technologies of these third parties may result in lower credit availability to our potential customers and therefore reduced sales. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether through a breach of our computer system or otherwise, could severely hurt our business.\nCertain aspects of our business involve the receipt, storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information and consumer preferences, as well as confidential information about our associates, our suppliers and our Company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of third parties with which we do business, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism and theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.\nAn electronic security breach in our systems (or in the systems of third parties with which we do business) that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable information about customers or other sensitive data could occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, lead to substantial financial losses from remedial actions, and lead to a substantial loss of business and other liabilities, including possible punitive damages. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies\u2019 obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs, and a material failure on our part to comply could subject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions and lawsuits.\nOur business is sensitive to economic conditions and consumer spending.\nWe face numerous business risks relating to macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during recessionary periods and other times when disposable income is lower. Factors impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, inflation, wages and employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth based on severe market declines, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, volatility of fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, political and economic uncertainty and other macroeconomic factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine. Deterioration in economic conditions, increasing inflation or increasing unemployment levels may reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers\u2019 use of credit, which may adversely affect our sales. In recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected, we may have to increase the number of promotional sales or otherwise dispose of inventory for which we have previously paid to manufacture, which could further adversely affect our financial performance. It is difficult to predict when or for how long any of these conditions could affect our business and a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nA substantial portion of our business is dependent on a small number of suppliers. A material disruption or labor shortage at any of our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities could impede our ability to meet customer demand, reduce our sales, and/or negatively affect our financial results.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend on third-party suppliers for the manufacturing of all of our products. Moreover, a substantial portion of our business is dependent on a small number of suppliers. Sacs, which represented approximately 10.5% of our revenues in fiscal 2022, 14.0% of our revenues in fiscal 2021, and 17.0% of our revenues in fiscal 2020, are currently manufactured by a single manufacturer in Texas, which has previously experienced, and may experience in the future, disruptions to its manufacturing operations. Sactionals, which represented approximately 87.6% of our revenues in fiscal 2022, 84.5% of our revenues in fiscal 2021, and 80.7% of our revenues in fiscal 2020, are manufactured by suppliers in the United States, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, and India.\nSome of our third-party suppliers are currently experiencing a shortage of qualified labor at their manufacturing facilities in certain geographies, particularly within the United States, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government relief programs and general macroeconomic factors. A prolonged shortage of qualified labor could decrease our third-party\nsuppliers' ability to effectively produce and meet our demands and efficiently operate their facilities. A prolonged labor shortage could also lead to increased labor costs from higher overtime, the need to hire temporary help to meet demand and higher wages rates in order to attract and retain employees. Any of these developments or manufacturing disruptions could materially increase our sourcing costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain of our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities, and machines within an otherwise operational facility, have previously ceased temporarily, and could in the future cease, operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, which could materially and adversely impact our business, operations and financial condition. These events include but are not limited to:\n\u2022equipment failure;\n\u2022public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other catastrophes;\n\u2022unscheduled maintenance outages;\n\u2022utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions;\n\u2022labor difficulties;\n\u2022other operational problems;\n\u2022war or terrorism;\n\u2022political, social or economic instability; or\n\u2022financial instability or bankruptcy of any such supplier.\nOur reliance on international suppliers increases our risk of supply chain disruption, which could materially increase the cost and reduce or delay the supply of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur current suppliers are located in China, Vietnam, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States. Our reliance on international suppliers increases our risk of supply chain disruption. Events that could cause disruptions to our supply chain include but are not limited to:\n\u2022the imposition of additional trade laws or regulations;\n\u2022public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022theft; and\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could materially increase the cost and reduce or delay the supply of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our dependence on foreign manufacturing and imports for our products.\nOur business highly depends on global trade, as well as trade and other factors that impact the specific countries where our vendors\u2019 production facilities are located. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain our existing foreign vendor relationships and to develop new ones based on the requirements of our business and any changes in trade dynamics that might dictate changes in the locations for sourcing of products. While we rely on long-term relationships with many of our vendors, we have no long-term contracts with them and generally transact business with them on an order-by-order basis.\nMany of our imported products are subject to existing duties, tariffs, anti-dumping duties and quotas that may limit the quantity or affect the price of some types of goods that we import into the United States. In addition, substantial regulatory uncertainty exists regarding international trade and trade policy, both in the United States and abroad.\nAll of our goods imported from China are subject to additional tariffs. In September 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative began imposing a 10 percent ad valorem duty on a subset of products imported from China, inclusive of various furniture product categories. In addition, effective May 10, 2019, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative began imposing an additional 15 percent ad valorem duty on a subset of products imported from China, inclusive of various furniture product categories. We believe that nearly all of our products sourced from China are, and will continue to be, affected by the tariffs. While we are continuing to assess these proposed tariffs on Chinese imports and are evaluating strategies to mitigate the effects of the tariffs, there can be no assurance that we will not experience disruption in our business.\nFurther, these changes to tariffs or other rules related to cross border trade, could materially increase our cost of goods sold with respect to products that we purchase from vendors who manufacture products in China, which could in turn require us to increase our prices and, in the event consumer demand declines as a result, negatively impact our financial performance. Certain of our competitors may be better positioned than us to withstand or react to these kinds of changes including border taxes, tariffs or other restrictions on global trade and as a result we may lose market share to such competitors. In addition, while we may be able to continue to expand and shift our sourcing options, such expansion is time consuming and would be difficult or impracticable for many products and may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs. Due to broad uncertainty regarding the timing, content and extent of any regulatory changes in the United States or abroad, we cannot predict the impact, if any, that these changes could have to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on suppliers in developing countries increases our risk with respect to available manufacturing infrastructure, labor and employee relations, political and economic stability, corruption, and regulatory, environmental, health and safety compliance.\nOur reliance on suppliers in developing countries increases our risk with respect to infrastructure available to support manufacturing, labor and employee relations, political and economic stability, corruption, and regulatory, environmental, health and safety compliance. Any failure of our suppliers to comply with ethical sourcing standards or labor or other local laws in the country of manufacture, or the divergence of a supplier\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could disrupt the shipment of products, force us to locate alternative manufacturing sources, reduce demand for our products, damage our reputation and/or expose us to potential liability for their wrongdoings. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nMost of our products are shipped from our suppliers by ocean vessel. If a disruption occurs in the operation of ports through which our products are imported, we may incur increased costs and suffer delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nMost of our products are shipped from our suppliers by ocean vessel. If a disruption occurs in the operation of ports through which our products are imported, for instance, as a result of port congestion, adverse weather, natural disasters or climate change, we may incur increased costs related to air freight or use of alternative ports. Shipping by air is significantly more expensive than shipping by ocean and our margins could be reduced. Shipping to alternative ports could also lead to delays in receipt of our products. We rely on third-party shipping companies to deliver our products to us; as a result, we are subject to various risks that are beyond our control, including labor disputes, union organizing activity, the closure of such shipping companies\u2019 offices or a reduction in operational capacity due to an economic slowdown or the inability to sufficiently ramp up operational capacity during an economic recovery or upturn, outbreaks of diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), increased fuel costs and costs associated with any regulations to address climate change, and other factors affecting the shipping industry\u2019s capacity or ability to deliver our products to us.\nIn addition, due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, ocean freight capacity issues continue to persist worldwide as there is much greater demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment, which has resulted in recent price increases per shipping container. Streamline ships are charging priority booking fees to allocate space as they have less ships and workers operating. While we continue to manage and evaluate our freight carriers, there is no indication that shipping container rates will return to historical levels in the near-term and these increases could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Our third-party shipping companies have experienced transportation disruptions and restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and delays stemming from delayed shipments from Asian ports, congestion at west coast ports, more extensive travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of businesses and facilities and a shortage of shipping containers needed to ship our products, which has adversely impacted our inventory levels and\nresulted in elevated, and sometimes lengthy, customer backorders. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIncreases in the demand for, or the price of, raw materials used to manufacture our products or other fluctuations in sourcing or distribution costs could increase our costs and negatively impact our gross margin.\nWe believe that we have strong supplier relationships, and we work with our suppliers to manage cost increases. Our gross margin depends, in part, on our ability to mitigate rising costs or shortages of raw materials used to manufacture our products. Raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to availability constraints and price volatility impacted by a number of factors, including supply and demand for fabrics, weather, government regulations, economic conditions, economic and political instability, and other unpredictable factors. In addition, our sourcing costs may fluctuate due to labor conditions, transportation or freight costs, energy prices, currency fluctuations, public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other unpredictable factors. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could increase our costs, delay or reduce the availability of our products and negatively impact our gross margin.\nAlthough we have instituted measures to ensure our supply chain remains open to us, we experienced raw material supply chain challenges related to suppliers negatively impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns and shipping delays. These global supply chain challenges could continue and in turn materially adversely impact our manufacturing production and fulfillment of backlog. While we strive to maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, the impact of COVID-19 on raw materials and increased demand on our supply chain, has created additional pricing and availability pressures. During fiscal 2021, certain raw material prices, such as foam, springs and fabrics, significantly increased and in some instances, limited our production due to sourcing delays. Continued higher raw material prices and costs of sourced products could have an adverse effect on our future margins. We expect raw material prices to remain at historically high levels in many categories during fiscal 2022 due to price inflation in certain raw materials and global supply chain complexities. COVID-19 related issues will continue to introduce uncertainty into many markets, especially with respect to freight and labor availability. To the extent that we experience incremental costs in any of these areas, we may increase our selling prices or assess material surcharges to offset the impact. However, increases in selling prices, or surcharges, may not fully mitigate the impact of raw material cost increases which would adversely impact operating income.\nOur inability to manage our inventory levels and products, including with respect to our omni-channel operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in lower than planned financial performance. Alternatively, if we underestimate demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages resulting in delays in fulfilling customer demands and replenishing to appropriate inventory levels, missed sales and lost revenues. Continued or lengthy delays in fulfilling customer demand could cause our customers to shop with our competitors instead of us, which could harm our business. Either of these events could significantly affect our operating results and brand image and loyalty. Our financial performance may also be impacted by changes in our products and pricing. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur business depends on effective marketing and increased customer traffic.\nWe rely on a variety of marketing strategies to compete for customers and increase sales. If our competitors increase their spending on marketing, if our marketing is less effective than that of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage the technology and data analytics needed to generate concise competitive insight, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur increased use of social media poses reputational risks.\nAs use of social media becomes more prevalent, our susceptibility to risks related to social media increases. The immediacy of social media precludes us from having real-time control over postings made regarding us via social media, whether matters of fact or opinion. Information distributed via social media could result in immediate unfavorable publicity we may not be able to reverse. This unfavorable publicity could result in damage to our reputation and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur efforts to launch new products may not be successful.\nWe plan to expand our product line in the future. We may not be able to develop products which are attractive to our customers, and our costs to develop new products may be significant. It may take longer than we might expect for a product, even if ultimately successful, to achieve attractive sales results. Failure to successfully develop or market new\nproducts or delays in the development of new products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nOur inability to manage the complexities created by our omni-channel operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur omni-channel operations create additional complexities in our ability to manage inventory levels, as well as certain operational issues, including timely shipping and returns. Accordingly, our success depends to a large degree on continually evolving the processes and technology that enable us to plan and manage inventory levels and fulfill orders, address any related operational issues and further align channels to optimize our omni-channel operations. If we are unable to successfully manage these complexities, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur ability to attract customers to our showrooms depends heavily on successfully locating our showrooms in suitable locations. Any impairment of a showroom location, including any decrease in customer traffic, could cause our sales to be lower than expected.\nWe plan to open new showrooms in high traffic street and urban locations and historically we have favored top tier mall locations near luxury and contemporary retailers that we believe are consistent with our key customers\u2019 demographics and shopping preferences. Sales at these showrooms are derived, in part, from the volume of foot traffic in these locations. Showroom locations may become unsuitable due to, and our sales volume and customer traffic generally may be harmed by, among other things:\n\u2022economic downturns in a particular area;\n\u2022competition from nearby retailers selling similar products;\n\u2022changing consumer demographics in a particular market;\n\u2022changing preferences of consumers in a particular market;\n\u2022the closing or decline in popularity of other businesses located near our store;\n\u2022reduced customer foot traffic outside a showroom location; and\n\u2022store impairments due to acts of God, pandemic, terrorism, protest or periods or civil unrest.\nEven if a showroom location becomes unsuitable, we will generally be unable to cancel the long-term lease associated with such showroom.\nWe may be unable to successfully open and operate new showrooms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had 146 showrooms, including 8 kiosks and 2 mobile concierges, but our growth strategy requires us to increase our showroom base. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in opening additional showrooms. If we are unable to successfully open and operate new showrooms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur ability to successfully open and operate new showrooms depends on many factors, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our showrooms will be successful;\n\u2022find available and suitable showroom locations that align with our consumer location strategy;\n\u2022obtain desired locations, including showroom size and adjacencies, in targeted high traffic street and urban locations and top tier malls;\n\u2022adapt our showrooms to address public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired rent and tenant improvement allowances;\n\u2022achieve brand awareness, affinity and purchaser intent in new markets;\n\u2022hire, train and retain showroom associates and field management;\n\u2022assimilate new showroom associates and field management into our corporate culture;\n\u2022source and supply sufficient inventory levels;\n\u2022employ the technologies needed to service a customer and complete a transaction;\n\u2022successfully integrate new showrooms into our existing operations and information technology systems; and\n\u2022have the capital necessary to fund new showrooms.\nIn addition, our new showrooms may not be immediately profitable, and we may incur significant losses until these showrooms become profitable. Unavailability of desired showroom locations, delays in the acquisition or opening of new showrooms, delays or costs resulting from a decrease in commercial development due to capital restraints, difficulties in staffing and operating new showroom locations or a lack of customer acceptance of showrooms in new market areas may negatively impact our new showroom growth and the costs or the profitability associated with new showrooms. While we are seeking to mitigate some of the risks related to our mall-based showrooms by opening high traffic street and lifestyle center-based showrooms and continuing to build our online sales, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful or lead to greater sales.\nAs we expand our showroom base, we may not be able to achieve the showroom sales growth rates that we have achieved in the past, which could cause our share price to decline.\nAs we expand our showroom base, we may not be able to achieve the showroom sales growth rates that we have achieved historically. If our showroom sales growth rates decline or fail to meet market expectations, the value of our common stock could decline. While our focus is to continue the expansion of our showrooms, this may result in the closure of underperforming showroom locations or locations with declining profitability in order to pursue more productive opportunities that are in line with our real estate strategy. The closure of these showrooms and transition to new showroom locations as part of our strategy may impact our sales and productivity.\nIn addition, the results of operations of our showroom locations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect showroom sales, including, among others, consumer spending patterns, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our product assortment, the success of marketing programs, weather conditions and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may have excess inventory of some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. These factors may cause our showroom sales results in the future to be materially lower than recent periods or our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe have and will continue to expend capital remodeling our existing showrooms, and there is no guarantee that this will result in incremental showroom traffic or sales.\nWe intend to continue remodeling our existing showroom base to reflect our new showroom design, and we intend to expend capital doing so. While preliminary results appear promising, there is no guarantee that the capital spent on these remodeled showrooms will result in increased showroom traffic or increased sales.\nOur lease obligations are substantial and expose us to increased risks.\nWe do not own any of our showrooms. Instead, we rent all of our showroom spaces pursuant to leases. Nearly all of our leases require a fixed annual rent, and many of them require the payment of additional rent if showroom sales exceed a negotiated amount. Most of our leases are \u201cnet\u201d leases that require us to pay all costs of insurance, maintenance and utilities, as well as applicable taxes.\nOur required payments under these leases are substantial and account for a significant portion of our selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect that any new showrooms we open will also be leased, which will further increase our\nlease expenses and require significant capital expenditures. Our substantial lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including, among others:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations, reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors who sell their products exclusively online.\nWe are required to make substantial lease payments under our leases, and any failure to make these lease payments when due would likely harm our business. In addition, many of our leases contain relocation clauses that allow the landlord to move the location of our showrooms. As our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate acceptable renewals.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from other sources, we may not be able to service our substantial lease expenses, which would harm our business.\nMoreover, our showroom leases are generally long term and non-cancelable, and we generally expect future showrooms to be subject to similar long term, non-cancelable leases. If an existing or future showroom is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be required to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term if we cannot negotiate a mutually acceptable termination payment.\nMany of our leases include relocation clauses that allow the landlord to move the location of our showrooms. If any of our showrooms are relocated, there can be no assurance that the new location will experience the same levels of customer traffic or success that the prior location experienced. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close showrooms in desirable locations. We may also be unable to enter into new leases on terms acceptable to us or in desirable locations. If any of the foregoing occur, our business, sales and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur inability to successfully optimize our omni-channel operations and maintain a relevant and reliable omni-channel experience for our customers could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nGrowing our business through our omni-channel operations is key to our growth strategy. Our goal is to offer our customers seamless access to our products across our channels, and our success depends on our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in sales and marketing strategies to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels, such as ecommerce, to meet their shopping needs. While we interact with many of our customers through our showrooms, our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets and smartphones to make purchases online and to help them make purchasing decisions when in our showrooms. Our customers also engage with us online through our social media channels, including Facebook and Instagram, by providing feedback and public commentary about aspects of our business. Failure to enhance our technology and marketing efforts to align with our customers\u2019 developing shopping preferences could significantly impair our ability to meet our strategic business and financial goals. Moreoever, if we do not successfully optimize our omni-channel operations, or if they do not achieve their intended objectives, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nPurchasers of furniture may choose not to shop online, which could affect the growth of our business.\nThe online market for furniture is less developed than the online market for apparel, consumer electronics and other consumer products in the United States. While we believe this market is growing, it still accounts for a small percentage of the market as a whole. We are relying on online sales for our continued success and growth. If the online market for furniture does not gain wider acceptance, our growth and business may suffer.\nIn addition, our success in the online market will depend, in part, on our ability to attract consumers who have historically purchased furniture through traditional retailers. We may have to incur significantly higher and more sustained advertising and promotional expenditures in order to attract additional online consumers to our website and convert them into purchasing customers. Specific factors that could impact consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase furniture from us online include:\n\u2022concerns about buying products, and in particular larger products, with a limited physical storefront, face-to-face interaction with sales personnel and the ability to physically examine products;\n\u2022actual or perceived lack of security of online transactions and concerns regarding the privacy of personal information;\n\u2022inconvenience associated with returning or exchanging items purchased online; and\n\u2022usability, functionality and features of our website.\nIf the online shopping experience we provide does not appeal to consumers or meet the expectations of existing customers, we may not acquire new customers at rates consistent with historical periods, and existing customers\u2019 buying patterns may not be consistent with historical buying patterns. If either of these events occur, our business, sales and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe depend on our ecommerce business and failure to successfully manage this business and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience to our customers could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy, business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nSales through our ecommerce channel account for a significant portion of our revenues. Our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects are dependent on maintaining our ecommerce business. Dependence on our ecommerce business and the continued growth of our direct and retail channels subjects us to certain risks, including:\n\u2022the failure to successfully implement new systems, system enhancements and Internet platforms;\n\u2022the failure of our technology infrastructure or the computer systems that operate our website and their related support systems, causing, among other things, website downtimes, telecommunications issues or other technical failures;\n\u2022the reliance on third-party computer hardware/software providers;\n\u2022rapid technological change;\n\u2022liability for online content;\n\u2022violations of federal, state, foreign or other applicable laws, including those relating to data protection;\n\u2022credit card fraud;\n\u2022cyber security and vulnerability to electronic break-ins and other similar disruptions; and\n\u2022diversion of traffic and sales from our stores.\nOur failure to successfully address and respond to these risks and uncertainties could negatively impact sales, increase costs, diminish our growth prospects and damage the reputation of our brand, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nSignificant merchandise returns could harm our business.\nWe allow our customers to return products, subject to our return policy. If customer returns are significant, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed. Further, we modify our policies relating to returns from time to time, which may result in customer dissatisfaction or an increase in the number of product returns.\nWe are subject to risks related to online payment methods.\nWe accept payment using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, Affirm and gift cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may become subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and increase our operating costs. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.\nAs our business changes, we may also be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or have restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card and debit card payments from consumers or our ability to facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. We may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions. If we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud, our liability for these transactions could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nFinance Risks\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited. Our inability to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf we experience insufficient cash flow from operations to support our operating and capital needs, we will be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We may sell common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in such a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such equity securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. Concerns over the economic impact of inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have caused extreme volatility in financial and capital markets, which has adversely impacted our stock price and may materially adversely affect our ability to access capital markets. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce, among other things, our operational flexibility. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, debt financings may be blocked by our senior lender that provides an asset-backed revolving credit facility to fund our inventory purchases in advance of customer sales. Our lender has, and any subsequent senior lender likely will have, the right to consent to any new debt financing. There can be no assurance that our lender will provide such consent. Our inability to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, and if we are unable to remediate such material weakness and maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may fail to timely and accurately report our financial results, experience a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our consolidated financial statements, incur material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d) requires that we furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment requires disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also needs to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We designed, implemented, and tested internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation. The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation required under Section 404 is costly and challenging, and, in the future, we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, related to ineffective information technology internal controls in the areas of user access and segregation of duties related to certain information technology systems that could impact our financial reporting process. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Although these control weaknesses did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented and there were no changes to previously released financial result, our management concluded that these control weaknesses constitute a material weakness and that our internal control was not effective as of January 30, 2022. Our management, under the oversight of our Audit Committee and in consultation with outside advisors, has begun evaluating and implementing measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated.\nWe believe our remediation efforts will be effective in remediating the material weakness described above, and we will continue to devote time and attention to these remedial efforts. However, as we continue to evaluate and take actions to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional actions to address control deficiencies or modify certain of the remediation measures described above. Our remediation efforts will not be considered complete until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and our management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nIf we are unable to remediate the material weakness timely and sufficiently or if we identify future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion or expresses a qualified or adverse opinion about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we may experience a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our consolidated financial statements, incur material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, incur difficulty accessing capital on favorable terms, or at all, be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, incur reputational harm, and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe rely on financial reporting and data analytics that must be accurate in order to make real-time management decisions, accurately manage our cash position, and maintain adequate inventory levels while conserving adequate cash to fund operations. In the event of a systems failure, a process breakdown, the departure of key management, or fraud, we would be unable to efficiently manage these items and may experience liquidity shortfalls that our cash position or revolving credit facility may not be able to accommodate. In such a situation, we also may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast our operating results and growth rate, which may adversely affect our reported results and stock price.\nWe may not be able to accurately forecast our operating results and growth rate. We use a variety of factors in our forecasting and planning processes, including historical results, recent history and assessments of economic and market conditions. Our growth rates may not be sustainable, and our growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products we offer. Lower demand caused by changes in customer preferences, a weakening of the economy or other factors may result in decreased revenues or growth. Furthermore, many of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in our operating results. Failure to accurately forecast our operating results and growth rate could cause our actual results to be materially lower than anticipated. If our growth rate declines as a result, investors\u2019 perceptions of our business may be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nTo manage our anticipated growth effectively, we must continue to implement our operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our corporate infrastructure, information systems, and executive management and expand, train and manage our associate base. As we grow, we will need to find, train, and monitor additional associates and continue to invest in information systems that support key functions such as accounting, human resources, sales analytics, and marketing, all of which strain the time of our executive management team and our resources. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nChanges in lease accounting standards may materially and adversely affect us.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). We adopted this standard beginning in fiscal 2022. We are required to capitalize all leases with a life greater than one year on our balance sheet and account for our showroom leases as assets and liabilities, where we previously accounted for such leases on an \u201coff balance sheet\u201d basis. As a result, a significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities were recorded on our balance sheet. These changes have not directly impacted our overall financial condition. However, they could cause investors or others to believe that we are highly leveraged and could change the calculations of financial metrics and covenants under our debt facilities and third-party financial models regarding our financial condition.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nIncreasing regulations and expectations on environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nMany investors, customers and other key stakeholders have increased their focus on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors and corporate responsibility. As a result, there is a strong emphasis on ESG ratings and several third parties have created numerous standards by which they measure a company's corporate responsibility performance. In addition, these ESG standards may continue to change causing us to make substantial investments to satisfy them in order to meet the expectations of our investors, customers and other stakeholders. If we are unable to satisfy these ESG standards, our investors, customer and stakeholders may conclude that our policies and performance with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. Our inability to meet these standards may harm our brand and reputation, and our investments in ESG may impact our results of operations. Furthermore, if our competitors\u2019 corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, we may lose current or future investors who may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, we have and will continue to communicate our ESG goals and priorities. If we do not achieve these goals and priorities, or fail to meet the expectations of investors and other key stakeholders, our reputation and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell.\nWe have not had any significant product liability claims to date. We place a high priority on designing our products to be safe for consumers and safety test our products in third-party laboratories. Still, the products we sell or have manufactured may expose us to product liability claims, litigation and regulatory action relating to personal injury, death and environmental or property damage. Some of our agreements with our suppliers and international manufacturers may not indemnify us from product liability for a particular supplier\u2019s or international manufacturer\u2019s products, or our suppliers or international manufacturers may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any product liability claims asserted against us could, among other things, harm our reputation, damage our brand, cause us to incur significant costs, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProduct warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe provide a lifetime warranty on the hard insert pieces of our Sactionals and the soft insert pieces of our Sacs, which, if deficient, could lead to warranty claims. The Company maintains a reserve for warranty claims. However, there can be no assurance that our reserve for warranty claims will be adequate and additional or reduced warranty reserves may be required. Material warranty claims could, among other things, harm our reputation and damage our brand, cause us to incur significant repair and/or replacement costs, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violations of data protection laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store confidential information, including proprietary business information belonging to us, our customers, suppliers, business partners and other third parties and personally identifiable information of our associates. We rely on information technology systems to protect this information and to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures and user errors. If we experience a disruption in our information technology systems, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have been and may in the future be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing attempts, social engineering, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by disgruntled associates or third parties, and other means of unauthorized access. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our information technology network and systems have been and, we believe, continue to be under constant attack. Accordingly, despite our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, a security breach may occur, including breaches that we may not be able to detect. A breach of our or our third party service providers' information technology systems that results in the unauthorized release of confidential information could adversely affect our reputation, leading to a loss of our existing customers and potential future customers, cause financial losses due to remedial actions or potential liability, including punitive damages and regulatory fines or penalties, and materially increase the costs we incur to protect against these risks, including costs associated with insurance coverage and potential remediation measures. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented work-from-home policies for certain employees. Although we continue to implement strong physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our business operations remain functional and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers, our systems and our operations remain vulnerable to cyberattacks and other disruptions due to the fact that a significant portion of our employees work remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot be certain that our mitigation efforts will be effective.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and ecommerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and ecommerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, ecommerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, consumer protection, Internet neutrality and gift cards. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or ecommerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet or ecommerce, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices.\nThough we seek at all times to be in full compliance with all such laws, we cannot be sure that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could damage our reputation and brand, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our website by consumers and result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks or brand image, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on trademark registrations and common law trademark rights to protect the distinctiveness of our brand. We regard our customer and prospect lists, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, patents and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, agreements and other methods with our associates and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have 26 issued U.S. utility patents and 38 issued foreign utility patents, that are scheduled to expire between 2022 and 2039. We also have 15 pending U.S. utility patent applications, 35 pending foreign utility patent applications and 2 pending international patent applications. Our inability to\nenforce or the expiration of our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and our business. If we are unable to protect our technology and to adequately maintain and protect our intellectual property rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to create the innovative solutions that have enabled us to be successful to date. The loss or expiration of our intellectual property rights and exclusivity agreements can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or infringement of our trademarks by others. We may not be able to claim or assert trademark or unfair competition claims against third parties for any number of reasons, and our trademarks may be found invalid or unenforceable. A judge, jury or other adjudicative body may find that the conduct of competitors does not infringe or violate our trademark rights. Third parties may claim that the use of our trademarks and branding infringe, dilute or otherwise violate the common law or registered marks of that party, or that our sales and marketing efforts constitute unfair competition. Such claims could result in injunctive relief prohibiting the use of our marks, branding and marketing activities, and significant damages, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs could be awarded as a result of such claims. Moreover, United States and foreign trademark offices may refuse to grant existing and future trademark applications and may cancel or partially cancel trademark registrations.\nThe laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the use of unregistered trademarks to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. As a result, international protection of our brand image may be limited, and our right to use our trademarks outside the United States could be impaired. Other persons or entities may have rights to trademarks that contain portions of our marks or may have registered similar or competing marks for furniture and/or accessories in foreign countries where our products are manufactured. There may also be other prior registrations of trademarks identical or similar to our trademarks in other foreign countries of which we are not aware. Accordingly, it may be possible for others to prevent the manufacture of our branded merchandise in certain foreign countries or the sale or exportation of our branded merchandise from certain foreign countries to the United States. If we were unable to reach a licensing arrangement with these parties, we might be unable to manufacture our products in those countries. Our inability to register our trademarks or purchase or license the right to use the relevant trademarks or logos in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to manufacture our products in less costly markets or penetrate new markets in jurisdictions outside the United States. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our customer and prospect lists, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, patents and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, agreements and other methods with our associates and others to protect our proprietary rights. We might not be able to obtain protection in the United States or internationally for our intellectual property, and we might not be able to obtain effective intellectual property protection in countries in which we may in the future sell products. If we are unable to obtain such protection, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects may be harmed. Additionally, associates, contractors or consultants may misappropriate or disclose our confidential information or intellectual property and agreements with those persons may not exist, may not cover the information or intellectual property in question, or may not be enforceable, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects for the future.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights may require the expenditure of significant financial, managerial and operational resources. Notwithstanding such expenditures, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or disclosing confidential information or intellectual property. The validity, enforceability and infringement of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others in litigation or through administrative process, and we may not prevail in such disputes. Additionally, because the process of obtaining patent and trademark protection is expensive and time-consuming, we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent and trademark applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner, and such applications may never be granted. Even if such applications issue as patents and trademarks, there can be no assurance that these patents and trademarks will adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects may be harmed.\nWe also might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any infringement, misappropriation, disclosure or other violation of our intellectual property rights, confidential information or other proprietary rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property rights, confidential information or other\nproprietary rights or to establish the validity of such rights. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties, former associates, consultants or independent contractors from infringing upon, misappropriating, disclosing or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights, confidential information and other proprietary rights. In addition, initiating claims or litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation, disclosure or violation of our intellectual property rights, confidential information or proprietary rights will be expensive, and may be prohibitively expensive. Any litigation or other dispute resolution mechanism, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur products or marketing activities may be found to infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.\nThird parties may assert claims or initiate litigation asserting that our products or our marketing activities infringe or violate such third parties\u2019 patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights. The asserted claims and/or litigation could include claims against us or our suppliers alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our products or components of such products.\nRegardless of the merit of the claims, if our products are alleged to infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to, among other things:\n\u2022obtain licenses to use such intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022redesign our products or change our marketing activities to avoid infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022stop using the subject matter protected by the intellectual property held by others;\n\u2022pay significant compensatory and/or enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs; and/or\n\u2022defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our time, financial and management resources.\nIf any of the foregoing occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.\nThe stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our customer growth, sales, or other operating results;\n\u2022variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors, and the financial community;\n\u2022any forward-looking financial or operating information we may provide to the public or securities analysts, any changes in this information, or our failure to meet expectations based on this information;\n\u2022actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022additional shares of our common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales, including if existing stockholders sell shares into the market when applicable \u201clock-up\u201d periods end;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022developments in new legislation or rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies;\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events; and\n\u2022the societal and economic impact of public health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these securities or industry analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock, publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell shares or other securities in the future that could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the current price per share of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our Company more difficult, and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors or stockholders holding at least 25% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022provide that directors may only be removed by the majority of the shares of voting stock then outstanding entitled to vote generally in election of directors;\n\u2022require a majority of all directors who constitute the board of directors or holders at least 25% of the issued and outstanding shares our common stock to adopt, amend or repeal provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws;\n\u2022require 50% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in election of directors to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with certain sections of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation;\n\u2022except as otherwise provided by the terms of any series of preferred stock, special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, the chairperson of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer) or at least 25% of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe continued operation and growth of our business will require substantial cash. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, indebtedness, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Consequently, the only way our shareholders may be able to realize future gain on their investment is to sell their shares of common stock after the price of such shares has appreciated. However, there is no guarantee that our shares of common stock will appreciate in value.", "PERMNO": 17891, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "LOVE"}
