RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our future business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally. We operate primarily in the Wisconsin and Minnesota markets. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in the economic conditions in those areas. In addition, our business is susceptible to broader economic trends within the United States economy. Economic conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services, as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, tariffs, unemployment, changes in securities markets, changes in housing market prices, geopolitical uncertainties, natural disasters, pandemics and election outcomes or other factors could impact economic conditions and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions intended to prevent and mitigate its spread, challenges related to vaccination rollout and new variants of the virus has and is expected to continue to (and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases likely would) significantly and negatively impact financial markets and economic conditions in our markets, the United States and globally. As a result, consumer confidence and consumer credit factors have been, and may be further, negatively impacted. Consequently, our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and could be further significantly and adversely affected. See also \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to cause adverse economic conditions and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our results of operations and other aspects of our business.\u201d\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to cause adverse economic conditions and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our results of operations and other aspects of our business. We are closely monitoring developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impact on our business. While still evolving, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic and financial turmoil both in the U.S. and around the world, and has fueled concerns that it may lead to a global recession. These conditions may continue and worsen in the near term. At this time, it is not possible to estimate how long it will take to halt the spread of the virus or the long term effects that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or prospects will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain or address its impact.\nWhile we have implemented risk management and contingency plans and taken preventive measures and other precautions, no predictions of specific scenarios can be made with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic and such measures may not adequately predict the impact on our business from such events. Currently, many of our employees have been working remotely for an extended period of time. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business.\nIncreased economic uncertainty and increased unemployment resulting from the economic impacts of the spread of COVID-19 may also adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, or could substantially weaken the value of collateral securing those loans. In addition, any resulting downward pressure on real estate values could increase the potential for problem loans and thus have a direct impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nWe participate as an approved lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program, which was established under the congressionally-approved Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). The Paycheck Protection Program gives small businesses and self-employed individuals guaranteed loans and loan forgiveness to stay in business during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to certain requirements. As an SBA-approved lender, we secured more than $194 million in authorized funding for our customers under the Paycheck Protection Program. As a result of factors including the fact that the Paycheck Protection Program is a new program that was created urgently in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, lenders and customers have experienced, and may experience further, challenges in the administration and debt forgiveness process.\nWhile governmental and non-governmental organizations are engaging in efforts to combat the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues, these measures may not be effective. We also cannot predict how legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health issues will impact our business. Such events or conditions could result in regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future.\nActs or threats of terrorism and political or military actions by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic industry conditions. Geopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general or industry conditions and, as a result, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nDeterioration in the markets for residential real estate, including secondary residential mortgage loan markets, could reduce our net income and profitability. During the severe recession that lasted from 2007 to 2009, softened residential housing markets, increased delinquency and default rates, and volatile and constrained secondary credit markets negatively impacted the mortgage industry. Our financial results were adversely affected by these effects including changes in real estate values, primarily in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and our net income declined as a result. Decreases in real estate values adversely affected the value of property used as collateral for loans as well as investments in our portfolio. Continued slow growth in the economy since 2009 resulted in increased competition and lower rates, which has negatively impacted our net income and profits.\nThe foregoing changes could affect our ability to originate loans and deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and the average maturity of our securities portfolio. An increase in the level of interest rates may also adversely affect the ability of certain of our borrowers to repay their obligations. If interest rates paid on deposits or other borrowings were to increase at a faster rate than the interest rates earned on loans and investments, our net income would be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nWe are subject to interest rate risk. Through our banking subsidiary, the Bank, our profitability depends in large part on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from interest earning assets, such as loans and mortgage-backed securities, and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change such that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increase faster than the interest earned on loans and investments. As a result of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rates in the United States have been reduced, and may be even further reduced. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over\ntime due to many factors that are beyond our control, including but not limited to: general economic conditions and government policy decisions, especially policies of the Federal Reserve Bank. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk. In particular, reduced interest rates negatively impact our results of operations. See also \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to cause adverse economic conditions and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our results of operations and other aspects of our business.\u201d\nWe are subject to lending risk. There are inherent risks associated with our lending activities. These risks include the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets we serve, as well as those across the United States. Our exposure to lending risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards, and we avoid highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations, but there can be no assurance that our risk mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk. An increase in interest rates or weakening economic conditions (such as high levels of unemployment), including weakening economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has and could further adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, or could substantially weaken the value of collateral securing those loans. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank had $6.6 million of COVID-19 related modifications under Section 4013 of the CARES Act remaining. See \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d for discussion of COVID-19 qualitative factors, and related provision for loan losses. Downward pressure on real estate values could increase the potential for problem loans and thus have a direct impact on our consolidated results of operations. In addition, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. Although we exercise prudent due diligence when making loans, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. See also \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to cause adverse economic conditions and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our results of operations and other aspects of our business.\u201d\nWe are subject to higher lending risks with respect to our commercial and agricultural banking activities which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our loans include commercial and agricultural loans, which include loans secured by real estate as well as loans secured by personal property. Commercial real estate lending, including agricultural loans, typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. Agricultural operating loans carry significant risks as they may involve larger balances concentrated with a single borrower or group of related borrowers. In addition, repayment of such loans depends on the successful operation or management of the farm property securing the loan for which an operating loan is utilized. Farming operations may be affected by factors outside of the borrower\u2019s control, including adverse weather conditions, such as drought, hail or floods that can severely limit crop yields and declines in market prices for agricultural products. Although the Bank manages lending risks through its underwriting and credit administration policies, no assurance can be given that such risks will not materialize, in which event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and business prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient. To address risks inherent in our loan portfolio, we maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that exist within our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of various factors, including specific credit risks, historical loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. Determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make estimates of significant credit risks, which may undergo material changes. In evaluating our impaired loans, we assess repayment expectations and determine collateral values based on all information that is available to us. However, we must often make subjective decisions based on our assumption about the creditworthiness of the borrowers and the values of collateral securing these loans.\nDeterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically examine our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of our management.\nIf charge-offs in future periods exceed our allowance for loan losses, we will need to take additional loan loss provisions to increase our allowance for loan losses. Any additional loan loss provision will reduce our net income or increase our net loss, which could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the fair value or ratings downgrades of our securities may reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity, net earnings, or regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2021, $203.1 million of our securities, were classified as available for sale and $71.1 million were classified as held to maturity. The estimated fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on market conditions. Our available for sale securities portfolio is comprised of fixed-rate, and\nto a lesser extent, floating rate securities. We increase or decrease stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of the change in unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and amortized cost) of our available for sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax benefit or provision, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in our reported stockholders\u2019 equity, as well as our book value per common share and tangible book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold, the decrease may be recovered over the life of the securities.\nWe conduct a periodic review and evaluation of our securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. Factors which we consider in our analysis include, but are not limited to, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the security, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions, our intent and ability to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and the likelihood of any near-term fair value recovery. We generally view changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with our experience. If we deem such decline to be other-than-temporary related to credit losses, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of non-interest income in the period in which the decline in value occurs.\nWe have, in the past, recorded other than temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) charges, principally arising from investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities. We do not currently hold any non-agency mortgage-backed securities. We continue to monitor our securities portfolio as part of our ongoing OTTI evaluation process. No assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize OTTI charges related to securities in the future. Future OTTI charges would cause decreases to both Tier 1 and Risk-based capital levels which may expose the Company and/or the Bank to additional regulatory restrictions.\nThe capital that we are required to maintain for regulatory purposes is impacted by, among other factors, the securities ratings on our portfolio. Therefore, ratings downgrades on our securities may also have a material adverse effect on our risk-based regulatory capital levels.\nCompetition may affect our results. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete in our primary market area. We face strong competition in originating loans, in seeking deposits and in offering other banking services. We compete with commercial banks, trust companies, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. Our market area is also served by commercial banks and savings associations that are substantially larger than us in terms of deposits and loans, have greater human and financial resources, and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. This competitive climate can make it difficult to establish, maintain and retain relationships with new and existing customers and can lower the rate we are able to charge on loans, increase the rates we must offer on deposits, and affect our charges for other services. Those factors can, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nCustomers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could result in a loss of income to us. Technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction. For example, customers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. We are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nMaintaining or increasing our market share may depend on lowering prices and market acceptance of new products and services. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and customer demands. We face increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices, which can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet and mobile banking services, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. We may not be successful in introducing new products and\nservices, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers, which in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe may not have sufficient pre-tax net income in future periods to fully realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets. Assessing the need for, or the sufficiency of, a valuation allowance requires management to evaluate all available evidence. Based on future pre-tax net income projections and the planned execution of existing tax planning strategies, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the benefits of our net deferred tax assets. However, our current assessment is based on assumptions and judgments that may or may not reflect actual future results. If a valuation allowance becomes necessary, it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could experience an unexpected inability to obtain needed liquidity. Liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits, and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. We seek to ensure our funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity through asset/liability management. If we become unable to obtain funds when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, it could limit our ability to take advantage of what we believe to be good market opportunities for expanding our loan portfolio.\nFuture growth, operating results or regulatory requirements may require us to raise additional capital but that capital may not be available. We are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. To the extent our future operating results erode capital or we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisition, we may be required to raise additional capital.\nOur ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or if we are subject to material unfavorable terms for such capital, we may be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These actions could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain key people. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. We depend on the talents and leadership of our executive team, including Stephen M. Bianchi, our Chief Executive Officer, and James S. Broucek, our Chief Financial Officer. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our local markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nWe continually encounter technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven by new or modified products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes. As a bank, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our customers which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customers' information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity in recent periods. Given such increase in electronic fraudulent activity and the growing level of use of electronic, internet-based and networked systems to conduct business directly or indirectly with our clients, certain fraud losses may not be avoidable regardless of the preventative and detection systems in place. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technologies, and, as a result, we are subject to various Cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes and procedures established to protect\ninformation technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack, or damage. Our business involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 personal information. While we have internal policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, as well as contracts and service agreements with applicable outside vendors, we cannot be assured that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do, that they will be addressed adequately. Any failure or interruption of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our loan, deposit, general ledger and other systems. We rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm our business. Although we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches, cyber incidents and other security threats, our facilities and systems, and those of third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human error, or other similar events that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough, to date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of some of our business operations and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the storage and transmission of such data is regulated at the federal and state level. Privacy information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance therewith, may result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or experience a data security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subject to fines, penalties, administrative orders and other legal risks as a result of a breach or non-compliance.\nOur internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any (a) failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, (b) failure to adequately address any internal control deficiencies, or (c) failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See Item 9A \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d for further discussion of our internal controls.\nOur growth strategy includes selectively acquiring businesses through acquisitions of other banks, and our ability to consummate these acquisitions on economically advantageous terms acceptable to us in the future is unknown. Our growth strategy includes acquisitions of other banks that serve customers or markets we find desirable, including our recent acquisitions of Community Bank of Northern Wisconsin (\u201cCBN\u201d), WFC, United Bank and F&M. The market for acquisitions remains highly competitive, and we may be unable to find satisfactory acquisition candidates in the future that fit our acquisition and growth strategy. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Any such acquisitions could be funded through cash from operations, the issuance of equity and/or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which amount may be material, or a combination thereof. Any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity per share of our common stock. Also, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of our growth strategy may be lost.\nAcquisition and expansion activities may disrupt our business, dilute existing stockholders and adversely affect our operating results. We acquired F&M in July 2019, United Bank in October 2018, WFC in August 2017 and CBN in May 2016. We intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities in the normal course of our business. Although the integration of F&M, United Bank, WFC and CBN have been successfully completed, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage the ongoing integration of any such future acquisitions. Acquiring other banks or financial service companies, as well as other geographic and product expansion activities, involve various risks including:\n\u2022risks of unknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022unanticipated costs and delays;\n\u2022risks that acquired new businesses do not perform consistent with our growth and profitability expectations;\n\u2022risks of entering new markets or product areas where we have limited experience;\n\u2022risks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions;\n\u2022difficulties, expenses and delays of integrating the operations and personnel of acquired institutions, and start-up delays and costs of other expansion activities;\n\u2022potential disruptions to our business;\n\u2022possible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions;\n\u2022potential short-term decreases in profitability; and\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from our existing operations and business.\nOur failure to execute our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nOur ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from our banking subsidiary, the Bank, which is subject to regulatory and other limitations. We are a bank holding company and our operations are conducted primarily by our banking subsidiary, the Bank. Since we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends on our receipt of dividends from the Bank.\nThe Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to pay dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations. Federal bank regulators are authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. In particular, federal bank regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organization\u2019s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.\nThe ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is also subject to its profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. The Bank may not be able to generate adequate cash flow to pay us dividends in the future. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is also subject to the terms of its Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement dated August 27, 2020 and Business Note Agreement dated August 1, 2018, each of which prohibits the Company from declaring or paying dividends while an event of default has occurred and is continuing under each respective agreement. The Company has pledged 100% of Bank stock as collateral for the loan and credit facilities provided for by the Business Note Agreement. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFurthermore, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive the dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be more volatile. Because our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of similar companies, which are exchanged, listed or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market. We believe there are 9,957,783 shares of our common stock held by nonaffiliates as of March 2, 2022. Thus, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading prices for our shares of common stock may be more volatile, which may make it difficult for investors to resell shares at the volume, prices and times desired. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nREGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nA new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has adopted a new accounting standard referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, which will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. The FASB extended the effective date of CECL from January 2021 to January 2023 for smaller reporting companies such as the Company. Once effective, this will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we will need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Banking regulators expect the new accounting standard will increase the allowance for loan losses. Any change in the allowance for loan losses at the time of adoption will be an adjustment to retained earnings and would change the Bank\u2019s capital levels. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and are subject to changes, which could increase our cost structure or have other negative impacts on our operations. The banking industry is extensively regulated at the federal and state levels. Insured depository institutions and their holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by financial regulatory authorities covering all aspects of their organization, management and operations. We are also subject to regulation by the SEC. Our compliance with these regulations, including compliance with regulatory commitments, is costly. Regulation includes, among other things, capital and reserve requirements, the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed, permissible investments and lines of business, mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on transactions with insiders and affiliates, anti-money laundering regulations, dividend limitations, community reinvestment requirements, limitations on products and services offered, loan limits, geographical limits, and consumer credit regulations. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund, our depositors and the public, rather than our stockholders. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation, or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanction by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, and/or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any change in government regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to pay dividends.\nFederal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank, that a person or group may acquire, without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, and the OCC before acquiring control of any national bank, such as the Bank. Under the BHCA and Federal Reserve guidance thereunder, a person or group will be presumed to control a bank holding company if they acquire a certain percentage of the bank holding company or if one or more other control factors are present. On January 31, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board approved the issuance of a final rule (which became effective October 1, 2020) that clarified and codified the Federal Reserve\u2019s standards for determining whether one company has control over another. The final rule established four categories of tiered presumptions of noncontrol that are based on the percentage of voting shares held by the investor (less than 5%, 5-9.9%, 10-14.9% and 15-24.9%) and the presence of other indicia of control. As the percentage of ownership increases, fewer indicia of control are permitted without falling outside of the presumption of noncontrol. These indicia of control include nonvoting equity ownership, director representation, management interlocks, business relationship and restrictive contractual covenants. Under the final rule, investors can hold up to 24.9% of the voting securities and up to 33% of the total equity of a company without necessarily having a controlling influence. The overall effect of the BHCA is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other non-bank companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company are costly. Reporting requirements of a public company change depending on the reporting classification in which the Company falls as of the end of its second quarter of each fiscal year. The Company is currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which allows us to provide certain simplified and scaled disclosures in our filings. We will remain a smaller reporting company for so long as the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates as of the end of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter is less than $250 million, or as of the same period the Company\u2019s annual revenues are less than $100 million and its public float is less than $700 million. In addition, the Company is currently considered a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d and will maintain that status for so long as the Company\u2019s annual revenues are less than $100 million, and its public float is more than $75 million but less than $700 million. If the Company were to be classified as an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d rather than a \u201cnon-accelerated filer,\u201d then we would become subject to the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404(b) requires that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of these controls, making the public reporting process more costly.\nChanges in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are impacted by tax policy implemented at the federal and state level. We cannot predict whether any other tax legislation will be enacted in the future or whether any such changes to existing federal or state tax law would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines. Our financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring, and given recent economic conditions, more drastic changes may occur. The implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91609, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CZWI"}
