{"cik": "1698990", "company": "Magnolia Oil & Gas Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe nature of Magnolia\u2019s business activities subjects the Company to certain hazards and risks. The following risks and uncertainties, together with other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered by current and future investors in the Company\u2019s securities. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones Magnolia faces. Additional risks and uncertainties presently unknown to Magnolia, or currently deemed immaterial, also may impair the Company\u2019s business operations. The occurrence of one or more of these risks or uncertainties could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, its financial condition, and the results of Magnolia\u2019s operations, which in turn could negatively impact the value of the Company\u2019s securities.\nOil, natural gas, and NGL prices are volatile. A sustained period of low oil, natural gas, and NGL prices could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to meet its expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe prices Magnolia receives for its oil, natural gas, and NGL production will heavily influence its revenue, profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth, and the carrying value of its properties. Oil, natural gas, and NGLs are commodities, and their prices may fluctuate widely in response to market uncertainty and to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Historically, oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have been volatile. Likewise, NGLs, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane, and natural gasoline, each of which has different uses and pricing characteristics, have suffered significant recent declines in realized prices. The prices Magnolia receives for its production and the levels of Magnolia\u2019s production, depend on numerous factors beyond Magnolia\u2019s control, which include the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports of oil, natural gas, and NGLs;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in or affecting other producing regions or countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Russia;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, its members, and other state- controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe level of global exploration, development, and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global inventories;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which Magnolia operates;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost, and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nlocalized and global supply, demand fundamentals, and transportation availability; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing, and transporting reserves;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nexpectations about future commodity prices;\n\u2022\nevents that impact global market demand; and\n\u2022\nU.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. governmental regulation and taxes.\nLower commodity prices may reduce Magnolia\u2019s cash flow and borrowing ability. If Magnolia is unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, its ability to develop future reserves could be adversely affected. Also, using lower prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserves volumes due to economic limits. In addition, sustained periods with lower oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect drilling economics and Magnolia\u2019s ability to raise capital, which may require it to re-evaluate and postpone or eliminate its development program, and result in the reduction of some proved undeveloped reserves and related standardized measure. If Magnolia is required to curtail its drilling program, Magnolia may be unable to hold leases that are scheduled to expire, which may further reduce reserves. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may materially and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nMagnolia has not entered into hedging arrangements with respect to the oil, natural gas, and NGL production from its properties, and Magnolia will be exposed to the impact of decreases in the price of oil, natural gas, and NGLs.\nMagnolia has not entered into hedging arrangements to establish, in advance, a price for the sale of the oil, natural gas, and NGLs it produces. As a result, Magnolia will not be protected against decreases in such prices, and if such prices decrease significantly, Magnolia\u2019s business, results of operations, and cash flow may be materially adversely affected.\nMagnolia\u2019s development projects and acquisitions require substantial capital expenditures. Magnolia may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in its ability to access or grow production and reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital-intensive. Magnolia makes, and expects to continue to make, substantial capital expenditures related to development and acquisition projects. Magnolia has funded, and expects to continue to fund, its capital budget with cash generated by operations and potentially through borrowings under Magnolia\u2019s secured reserve-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cRBL Facility\u201d). However, Magnolia\u2019s financing needs may require it to alter or increase its capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets. The issuance of additional indebtedness would require that an additional portion of cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on its indebtedness, thereby further reducing its ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. The issuance of additional equity securities would be dilutive to existing stockholders. The actual amount and timing of future capital expenditures may differ materially from estimates as a result of, among other things: commodity prices; actual drilling results; the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment; and regulatory, technological, and competitive developments. A reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact Magnolia\u2019s ability to grow production.\nMagnolia\u2019s cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nthe prices at which Magnolia\u2019s production is sold;\n\u2022\nproved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe amount of hydrocarbons Magnolia is able to produce from its wells;\n\u2022\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to acquire, locate, and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nthe amount of Magnolia\u2019s operating expenses;\n\u2022\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to borrow under the RBL Facility;\n\u2022\nrestrictions in the instruments governing Magnolia\u2019s debt, and Magnolia\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to access the capital markets.\nIf Magnolia\u2019s revenues or the borrowing base under the RBL Facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, operational difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, Magnolia may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, Magnolia may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to it, if at all. If cash flow generated by Magnolia\u2019s operations or available borrowings under the RBL Facility are insufficient to meet its capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of the development of Magnolia\u2019s properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in reserves and production and could materially and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. If Magnolia incurs additional indebtedness, the operational risks that Magnolia faces could intensify, and Magnolia may be unable to service its existing debt service obligations.\nPart of Magnolia\u2019s business strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nMagnolia\u2019s operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion (\u201cD&C\u201d) techniques. The difficulties Magnolia faces drilling horizontal wells include:\n\u2022\nlanding its wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022\nstaying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022\nrunning its casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u2022\nbeing able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nDifficulties that Magnolia faces while completing its wells include the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022\nthe ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nUse of new technologies may not prove successful and could result in significant cost overruns or delays or reductions in production, and, in extreme cases, the abandonment of a well. In addition, certain of the new techniques may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to offset wells being shut in and the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. Furthermore, the results of drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer and emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, Magnolia may be more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If its drilling results are less than anticipated, the return on investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as anticipated, and Magnolia could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nFor example, potential complications associated with the new D&C techniques that Magnolia utilizes may cause Magnolia to be unable to develop its assets in line with current expectations and projections. Further, Magnolia\u2019s recent well results may not be indicative of its future well results.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMagnolia\u2019s future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of its development, production, and acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond its control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production.\nMagnolia\u2019s decisions to develop or purchase prospects or properties will depend, in part, on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis, production data, and engineering studies, which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see \u201cCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.\u201d In addition, the cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is often uncertain.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay, or cancel scheduled drilling projects, including:\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by, or resulting from, permitting activities, compliance with regulatory requirements, including limitations on wastewater disposal, emission of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d), and hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nsustained periods of low oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nequipment failures, accidents, or other unexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022\nlack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nissues related to compliance with environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental or safety hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\ntitle issues; and\n\u2022\nother market limitations in Magnolia\u2019s industry.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. In order to prepare the reserve estimates, Magnolia must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. The Company must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production, and engineering data. The extent, quality, and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. Magnolia cannot assure you that its management team\u2019s assumptions with respect to projected production and/or the timing of development expenditures will not materially change in subsequent periods. Magnolia\u2019s management team and board may determine to secure and deploy development capital at a faster or slower pace than currently assumed.\nActual future production, oil prices, natural gas prices, NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from Magnolia\u2019s estimates. For instance, initial production rates reported by Magnolia or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates, recovery efficiencies may be worse than expected, and production declines may be greater than anticipated and may be more rapid and irregular when compared\nto initial production rates. In addition, estimates of proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect additional production history, results of development activities, current commodity prices, and other existing factors. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. Moreover, there can be no assurance that reserves will ultimately be produced or that proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within the periods anticipated.\nActual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. If spot prices are below such calculated amounts, using more recent prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits.\nThe standardized measure of estimated reserves may not be an accurate estimate of the current fair value of estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe standardized measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The standardized measure requires historical twelve-month pricing as required by the SEC as well as operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions, and it also may not reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and natural gas properties. In addition, the sellers in the Business Combination were generally not subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income taxes other than certain state franchise taxes. Magnolia is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes. As a result, estimates included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of future net cash flow may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. Therefore, the standardized measure of estimated reserves included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of such proved reserves.\nProperties Magnolia has acquired or will acquire may not produce as projected, and Magnolia may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with such properties, or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nAcquiring oil and natural gas properties requires Magnolia to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, future oil and gas prices and their applicable differentials, development and operating costs, and potential liabilities, including environmental liabilities. In connection with these assessments, Magnolia performs a review of the subject properties that it believes to be generally consistent with industry practices. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. For these reasons, the properties Magnolia has acquired or will acquire may not produce as expected. In connection with the assessments, Magnolia performs a review of the subject properties, but such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of due diligence, Magnolia may not review every well, pipeline, or associated facility. Magnolia cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, when a review is performed. Magnolia may be unable to obtain or successfully enforce contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to Magnolia\u2019s purchase of the property. Magnolia may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with its expectations. Additionally, the success of future acquisitions will depend on Magnolia\u2019s ability to integrate effectively the then-acquired business into its then-existing operations. The process of integrating acquired assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of managerial and financial resources. Magnolia\u2019s failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the additionally acquired assets into its then-existing operations successfully, or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties, or the failure to acquire future assets at all, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause Magnolia has a limited operating history, it may be difficult to evaluate its ability to successfully implement its business strategy.\nBecause of Magnolia\u2019s limited operating history, the operating performance of its future assets and business strategy are not yet proven. As a result, it may be difficult to evaluate Magnolia\u2019s business and results of operations to date and to assess its future prospects. In addition, Magnolia may encounter risks and difficulties experienced by companies whose performance is dependent upon recently acquired assets, such as failing to operate its assets as expected, higher than expected operating costs, equipment breakdown or failures, and operational errors. Further, Magnolia\u2019s assets are operated on a day-to-day basis by EVOC\u2019s employees pursuant to the Services Agreement, and Magnolia may be less involved in the day-to-day operations of the assets. As a result of the foregoing, Magnolia may be less successful in achieving a consistent operating level capable of generating cash flows from operations as compared to a company that has had a longer operating history. In addition, Magnolia may be less equipped to identify and address operating risks and hazards in the conduct of its business than those companies that have had longer operating histories.\nMagnolia is not the operator on all of its acreage or drilling locations, and, therefore, is not able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of any non-operated assets and could be liable for certain financial obligations of the operators or any of its contractors to the extent such operator or contractor is unable to satisfy such obligations.\nMagnolia conducts many of its exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which the Company may not control decisions, either because the Company does not have a controlling interest or is not an operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with Magnolia\u2019s, and therefore decisions may be made that are not what the Company believes are in its best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations, and Magnolia may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of Magnolia\u2019s investment may be adversely affected.\nMagnolia\u2019s use of a contract operator to operate its assets may adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business.\nEVOC provides certain oil and gas operating services, including providing operating services for the substantial majority of Magnolia\u2019s assets under the Services Agreement, the term of which extends through at least October 29, 2020, subject to possible earlier termination. There can be no assurance that Magnolia\u2019s use of an experienced contract operator will make its operations successful. For example, EV Energy Partners, L.P., an entity that EVOC previously provided operating services for, entered bankruptcy in April of 2018. Magnolia cannot be certain that its use of EVOC to provide contract operating services will continue to be economical or that EVOC will be able or willing to provide similar or additional services to Magnolia during or after the term of the Services Agreement. In addition, other factors may exist that materially and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures, negating the benefits of low operating costs.\nAdverse weather conditions may negatively affect Magnolia\u2019s operating results and ability to conduct drilling activities.\nAdverse weather conditions may cause, among other things, increases in the costs of, and delays in, drilling or completing new wells, power failures, temporary shut-in of production, and difficulties in the transportation of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Any decreases in production due to poor weather conditions will have an adverse effect on revenues, which will in turn negatively affect cash flow from operations.\nMagnolia\u2019s operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on its ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Drought conditions have persisted in the areas where Magnolia\u2019s assets are located in past years. These drought conditions have led governmental authorities to restrict the use of water, subject to their jurisdiction, for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If Magnolia is unable to obtain water to use in operations, it may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas, which could have a material and adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMagnolia\u2019s producing properties are predominantly located in South Texas, making Magnolia vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited geographic area.\nSubstantially all of Magnolia\u2019s producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Karnes County portion of the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Giddings Field of the Austin Chalk. As a result, Magnolia may be disproportionately exposed to various factors, including, among others: (i) the impact of regional supply and demand factors, (ii) delays or interruptions of production from wells in such areas caused by governmental regulation, (iii) processing or transportation capacity constraints, (iv) market limitations, (v) availability of equipment and personnel, (vi) water shortages or other drought related conditions, or (vii) interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas, or NGLs. The concentration of Magnolia\u2019s assets in a limited geographic area also increases its exposure to changes in local laws and regulations, certain lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife and unexpected events that may occur in the regions such as natural disasters, seismic events, industrial accidents, or labor difficulties. Any one of these factors has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, and prevent development of lease inventory before expirations. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nThe marketability of Magnolia\u2019s production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which it does not control. If these facilities are unavailable, Magnolia\u2019s operations could be interrupted and its revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of Magnolia\u2019s oil and natural gas production depend in part upon the availability, proximity, and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties. Oil production is generally transported by gathering systems, including, with respect to the Karnes County Assets, the gathering system owned by Ironwood Eagle Ford Midstream, LLC. The remaining oil is generally then transported by the purchaser by truck. Natural gas production is generally transported by third-party gathering lines and, with respect to natural gas production from the Karnes County Assets, by the gathering system owned by Ironwood Eagle Ford Midstream, LLC. Magnolia does not control all of the trucks and transportation facilities used to transport production from the properties, and access to them may be limited or denied. Insufficient production from wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of Magnolia\u2019s or third-party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to deliver to market or produce oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in Magnolia\u2019s operations. If, in the future, Magnolia is unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, it may be required to shut in or curtail production. Any such shut-in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from Magnolia\u2019s fields, would materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nMagnolia may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which it invests.\nThe existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. While Magnolia typically obtains title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case Magnolia may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property. Additionally, if an examination of the title history of a property reveals that an oil or natural gas lease or other developed right has been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral interest desired, Magnolia\u2019s interest would substantially decline in value. In such cases, the amount paid for such oil or natural gas lease or leases would be lost.\nThe development of proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than anticipated. Therefore, proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Magnolia\u2019s assets contained 22.5 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves consisting of 12.3 MMBbls of oil, 31.4 Bcf of natural gas, and 5.0 MMBbls of NGLs. Development of these proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than anticipated. Magnolia\u2019s ability to fund these expenditures is subject to a number of risks. Magnolia may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in its ability to access or grow production and reserves. Delays in the development of reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of the proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves, and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause Magnolia to have to reclassify proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves. Furthermore, there is no certainty that Magnolia will be able to convert proved undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, or that undeveloped reserves will be economically viable or technically feasible to produce.\nCertain factors could require Magnolia to write-down the carrying values of its properties, including commodity prices decreasing to a level such that future undiscounted cash flows from its properties are less than their carrying value.\nAccounting rules require that Magnolia periodically review the carrying value of its properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices, specific market factors, circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics, and other factors, Magnolia may be required to write-down the carrying value of its properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash impairment charge to earnings. Commodity prices have been cyclical, settling as low as $46.92 per barrel for oil on the WTI spot price and $1.75 per MMBtu on the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas in 2019. Likewise, NGLs have seen significant volatility in realized prices. Further declines in commodity prices may adversely affect proved reserve values, which would likely result in a proved property impairment of Magnolia\u2019s properties, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken. Magnolia could experience material write-downs as a result of lower commodity prices or other factors, including low production results or high lease operating expenses, capital expenditures, or transportation fees.\nUnless Magnolia replaces its reserves with new reserves and develops those new reserves, its reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless Magnolia conducts successful ongoing exploration and development activities or continually acquires properties containing proved reserves, proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Magnolia\u2019s future reserves and production, and therefore future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on Magnolia\u2019s success in efficiently developing current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. Magnolia may not be able to develop, find, or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace future production. If Magnolia is unable to replace such production, the value of its reserves will decrease, and its business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nMagnolia depends upon a small number of significant purchasers for the sale of most of its oil, natural gas, and NGL production. The loss of one or more of such purchasers could, among other factors, limit Magnolia\u2019s access to suitable markets for the oil, natural gas, and NGLs it produces.\nMagnolia normally sells its production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the oil and natural gas\nbusiness. In 2019, there were two purchasers who accounted for an aggregate 62% of the total revenue attributable to Magnolia\u2019s assets. The loss of any significant purchaser could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s revenues in the short term. Magnolia expects to depend upon these or other significant purchasers for the sale of most of its oil and natural gas production. Magnolia cannot ensure that it will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for its future oil and natural gas production.\nMagnolia may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy debt obligations, which may not be successful.\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its indebtedness obligations, including the RBL Facility and the 6.0% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Notes\u201d), depends on Magnolia\u2019s financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, industry cycles and certain financial, business and other factors affecting Magnolia\u2019s operations, many of which are beyond Magnolia\u2019s control. Magnolia may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit Magnolia to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on its indebtedness. Failure to make required payments on its indebtedness will result in an event of default under the agreement governing the applicable indebtedness, entitling the requisite lenders of such indebtedness to accelerate the payment of obligations thereunder and to exercise other remedies, including in respect of collateral (if any) securing such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $400.0 million of principal debt related to the 2026 Senior Notes outstanding and no outstanding borrowings related to the RBL Facility and $550.0 million of borrowing capacity of the RBL Facility.\nIf Magnolia\u2019s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, Magnolia may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance existing indebtedness. Magnolia\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and its financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness may be at higher interest rates and may require Magnolia to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of Magnolia\u2019s existing or future debt instruments may restrict it from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely harm its ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, Magnolia could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. The RBL Facility and the indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes limit Magnolia\u2019s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions. Magnolia may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit Magnolia to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nRestrictions in Magnolia\u2019s existing and future debt agreements could limit Magnolia\u2019s growth and ability to engage in certain activities.\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to meet its expenses and debt obligations and comply with the covenants and restrictions contained therein will depend on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, industry, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond Magnolia\u2019s control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Magnolia\u2019s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. For example, Magnolia\u2019s RBL Facility requires Magnolia to maintain quarterly compliance with a leverage and current ratio and the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the absence of defaults and events of default thereunder, to borrow money. Magnolia\u2019s debt agreements also restrict the payment of dividends and distributions by certain of its subsidiaries to it, which could affect its access to cash. In addition, Magnolia\u2019s ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing its indebtedness will be affected by the levels of cash flow from operations, future events, and other circumstances beyond Magnolia\u2019s control. Breach of these covenants or restrictions will result in a default under Magnolia\u2019s debt agreements, which if not cured or waived within the applicable grace period (if any), would permit the acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder by the requisite holders of such indebtedness. Upon acceleration, the indebtedness would become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and any commitments of a lender to make further loans to Magnolia may terminate. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to Magnolia. In addition to accelerating the indebtedness, the requisite group of affected lenders may exercise remedies upon the incurrence of an event of default, including through foreclosure, in respect of the collateral securing any such secured financing arrangements. Moreover, any subsequent replacement of Magnolia\u2019s financing arrangements may require it to comply with more restrictive covenants, which could further restrict business operations.\nAny significant reduction in Magnolia\u2019s borrowing base under the RBL Facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact Magnolia\u2019s ability to fund its operations.\nThe RBL Facility limits the amounts Magnolia can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders determine, in good faith, in accordance with their respective usual and customary oil and gas lending criteria, based upon the loan value of the proved oil and gas reserves located within the geographic boundaries of the United States included in the most recent reserve report provided to the lenders. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $550.0 million of borrowing base capacity of the RBL Facility.\nThe RBL Facility requires periodic borrowing base redeterminations based on reserve reports. Additionally, the borrowing base is subject to unscheduled reductions due to certain issuances of new junior lien indebtedness, unsecured indebtedness or subordinated indebtedness, certain sales or acquisitions of borrowing base properties, or early monetizations or terminations of certain hedge or swap positions. An unscheduled redetermination may also be requested by the requisite lenders under the RBL Facility, once within a twelve month period, or by Magnolia, twice within a twelve month period. A reduced borrowing base could render Magnolia unable to access adequate funding under the RBL Facility. Additionally, if the aggregate amount outstanding under the RBL Facility exceeds the borrowing base at any time, Magnolia would be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base or to provide mortgages on additional borrowing base properties to eliminate such excess. As a result of a mandatory prepayment and/or reduced access to funds under the RBL Facility, Magnolia may be unable to implement its drilling and development plan, make acquisitions, or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nMagnolia\u2019s operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities.\nMagnolia\u2019s operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of the Company\u2019s operations or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to Magnolia\u2019s operations, including the acquisition of a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; the restriction of types, quantities, and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from the Company\u2019s operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. Magnolia may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by the Company or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by the Companies.\nMagnolia may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of operations. Additionally, Magnolia may not be insured for, or insurance may be inadequate to protect Magnolia against, these risks.\nMagnolia is not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMagnolia\u2019s development activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable releases of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas, or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater, air, and shoreline contamination, or the presence of endangered or threatened species;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions, and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters; and\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks targeting oil and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure.\nAny of these events could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss as a result of claims for:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources, and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nMagnolia may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if it believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProperties that Magnolia decides to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nProperties that Magnolia decides to drill that do not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities will adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable Magnolia to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. Magnolia cannot ensure that the analogies drawn from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to its drilling prospects. Further, Magnolia\u2019s drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle issues;\n\u2022\npressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of, and shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment, and services.\nMagnolia may be unable to make additional attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may disrupt its business and hinder its ability to grow.\nIn the future, Magnolia may make acquisitions of assets or businesses that are expected to complement or expand the Company\u2019s current business. However, there is no guarantee that Magnolia will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In the event it is able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, Magnolia may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. Competition for acquisitions may also increase the cost of, or cause Magnolia to refrain from, completing acquisitions.\nThe success of completed acquisitions will depend on Magnolia\u2019s ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into its existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of its managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that it will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms, or successfully acquire identified targets. Magnolia\u2019s failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into its then-existing operations successfully, or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of Magnolia\u2019s properties are subject to land use restrictions, which could limit the manner in which Magnolia conducts business.\nCertain of Magnolia\u2019s properties are subject to land use restrictions, including city ordinances, which could limit the manner in which Magnolia conducts business. Such restrictions could affect, among other things, access to and the permissible uses of facilities as well as the manner in which Magnolia produces oil and natural gas and may restrict or prohibit drilling in general. The costs incurred to comply with such restrictions may be significant in nature, and Magnolia may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and oilfield services could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s ability to execute its development plans within its budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe, and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, causing periodic shortages of supplies and needed personnel. Magnolia\u2019s operations are concentrated in areas in which oilfield activity levels have increased rapidly, and as a result, demand for such drilling rigs, equipment, and personnel, as well as access to transportation, processing, and refining facilities in these areas, have increased, as have the costs for those items. To the extent that commodity prices improve in the future, the demand for and prices of these goods and services are likely to increase, and Magnolia could encounter delays in securing, or an inability to secure, the personnel, equipment, power, services, resources, and facilities access necessary for it to resume or increase Magnolia\u2019s development activities, which could result in production volumes being below its forecasted volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and profitability. Furthermore, if it is unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, Magnolia may not be able to drill all of its acreage before its leases expire.\nMagnolia could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce profitability, cash flow, and ability to complete development activities as planned.\nHistorically, capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, natural gas, and NGL prices. These cost increases have resulted from a variety of factors that Magnolia will be unable to control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel, and other raw materials; increased demand for labor, services, and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased taxes. Decreased levels of drilling activity in the oil and natural gas industry in recent periods have led to declining costs of some drilling equipment, materials, and supplies. However, such costs may rise faster than increases in Magnolia\u2019s revenue if commodity prices rise, thereby negatively impacting its profitability, cash flow, and ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget.\nMagnolia may be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nLike many oil and gas companies, from time to time, Magnolia expects to be involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters, and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of its business. Such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on Magnolia because of legal costs, diversion of management, other personnel, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in its business practices, which could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties, or sanctions may be insufficient, and judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas produced by Magnolia, while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt production and cause it to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nThe EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations pursuant to the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from various sources.\nThe EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which will include certain of Magnolia\u2019s operations. These reporting requirements cover all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. Separately, in June 2016, the EPA published the Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources Reconsideration that establish new controls, known as Subpart OOOOa, for emissions of methane from new, modified, or reconstructed sources in the oil and gas sector (\u201cthe 2016 OOOOa\u201d). Following the change in presidential administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations. Most recently, in August 2019, the EPA proposed amendments to the 2016 standards that, among other things, would rescind methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the oil and natural gas industry but retain emissions limits for volatile organic compounds. Legal challenges to any final rulemaking that rescinds the 2016 standards are expected. As a result, Magnolia cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements.\nAlthough there has been no federal legislation to reduce GHG emissions, a number of states have developed programs that are aimed at reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, or encouraging the use of renewable energy or alternative low-carbon fuels. Cap and trade programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. For example, in April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which includes nonbinding pledges to limit or reduce future emissions. In November 2019, the United States formally initiated the one year withdrawal from the agreement but may later choose to rejoin the Paris Agreement or enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. However, the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement, or a separately negotiated agreement, are unclear at this time.\nSubstantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas produced by Magnolia and lower the value of its reserves. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds, and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil, natural gas, and NGL activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Additionally, activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive industries. Separately, activists may also pursue other means of curtailing oil and gas operations, such as through litigation. The Company continually monitors the global\nclimate change agenda initiatives, including stakeholder concerns, and responds accordingly based on its assessment of such initiatives on its business.\nA negative shift in investor or shareholder sentiment of the oil and gas industry could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business and ability to raise debt and equity capital.\nCertain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and gas industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension funds, university endowments, and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to reduce or stop financing oil and gas and related infrastructure projects.\nIn addition, shareholder activism has been recently increasing in the oil and gas industry, and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to Magnolia\u2019s business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations, or otherwise. Such actions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities, require the Company to incur increased costs, and/or result in reputational harm.\nSuch developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including Magnolia\u2019s. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, impacting the Company\u2019s future financial results.\nFederal, state, and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s production.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppants, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. It is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability. Magnolia routinely uses fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but certain federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA finalized regulations under the CWA in June 2016 prohibiting wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Separately, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The EPA report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances.\nFrom time to time the U.S. Congress has considered proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. While, to date, those proposals have not been enacted, several states have already enacted or are otherwise considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices through more stringent permitting, fluid disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal via injection wells are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to seismic events. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which the Company conducts business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for Magnolia to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas, and secure trained personnel.\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on its ability to evaluate and select suitable properties for acquisitions and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas, and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry. Many other oil and natural gas companies possess and employ greater financial, technical, and personnel resources than Magnolia. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than Magnolia\u2019s financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than Magnolia will able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has historically continually increased due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. Magnolia may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel, and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nMagnolia depends on the services of its senior management and technical personnel. Magnolia does not maintain, nor does Magnolia plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of its senior management could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Magnolia is also dependent, in part, upon EVOC\u2019s technical personnel in connection with operating its assets pursuant to the Services Agreement. A loss by EVOC of its technical personnel could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business and results of operations.\nMagnolia may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in its industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancement and the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, Magnolia may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial cost. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before Magnolia can. Magnolia may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies it expects to use were to become obsolete, Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm Magnolia\u2019s business may occur and not be detected.\nMagnolia\u2019s management does not expect that Magnolia\u2019s internal and disclosure controls will prevent all possible error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation of controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in Magnolia have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Magnolia is also dependent, in part, upon EVOC\u2019s internal and disclosure controls in connection with operating its assets pursuant to the Services Agreement. A failure of Magnolia\u2019s or EVOC\u2019s controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm Magnolia\u2019s business and results of operations.\nMagnolia\u2019s business could be adversely affected by security threats, including cyber security threats, and related disruptions.\nMagnolia relies heavily on its information systems, and the availability and integrity of these systems is essential to conducting Magnolia\u2019s business and operations. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise Magnolia\u2019s computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to the Company\u2019s business operations or the access, disclosure, or loss of Company data and proprietary information. Additionally, as a producer of natural gas and oil, Magnolia faces various security threats that could render its information or systems unusable, and threats to the security of its facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing and other facilities, refineries\nand pipelines. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of, or damage to, sensitive information, facilities, infrastructure, and systems essential to its business and operations, as well as data corruption, communication interruptions, or other disruptions to its operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMagnolia\u2019s implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for its information, systems, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. Magnolia is also dependent, in part, upon EVOC\u2019s information systems in connection with operating its assets pursuant to the Services Agreement. A failure in the security of EVOC\u2019s information systems could seriously harm Magnolia\u2019s business and results of operations.\nMagnolia is subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If the Company fails to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if the Company or its auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, Magnolia\u2019s investors may lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported information and Magnolia\u2019s stock price may be negatively affected.\nMagnolia is required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). Section 404 requires that the Company documents and tests its internal control over financial reporting and issues the management\u2019s assessment of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. This section also requires that the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm issue an attestation report on such internal control. If Magnolia fails to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if the Company or its auditors identify and report material weaknesses in Magnolia\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of the Company\u2019s annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in Magnolia\u2019s reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce Magnolia\u2019s ability to obtain financing, and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Magnolia\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Capital Structure\nMagnolia is a holding company. Magnolia\u2019s sole material asset is its equity interest in Magnolia LLC, and Magnolia is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Magnolia LLC to pay taxes and cover its corporate and other overhead expenses.\nMagnolia is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in Magnolia LLC. Magnolia has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Magnolia LLC has available cash, Magnolia intends to cause Magnolia LLC to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to its unitholders, including Magnolia, in an amount at least sufficient to allow Magnolia to pay its taxes and (ii) non-pro rata payments to Magnolia to reimburse it for its corporate and other overhead expenses. To the extent that Magnolia needs funds and Magnolia LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions or payments under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, Magnolia\u2019s liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nMagnolia\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of Magnolia\u2019s Class A Common Stock.\nMagnolia\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes its board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If Magnolia\u2019s board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third-party to acquire Magnolia. In addition, some provisions of Magnolia\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of Magnolia, even if the change of control would be beneficial to its stockholders, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of Magnolia\u2019s stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal Magnolia\u2019s bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to its board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, certain change of control events may have the effect of accelerating any payments due under Magnolia\u2019s RBL Facility, and could, in certain defined circumstances, require Magnolia to make an offer to repurchase its outstanding Senior Notes and/\nor result in the acceleration of payments required by the indenture governing its outstanding notes, which could be substantial and accordingly serve as a disincentive to a potential acquirer of the Company.\nFuture sales of Magnolia\u2019s Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce Magnolia\u2019s stock price, and any additional capital raised by Magnolia through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in the Company.\nMagnolia may sell additional shares of Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of its Class A Common Stock in subsequent offerings. Magnolia cannot predict the size of future issuances of its Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into Class A Common Stock or the effect, if any, that such future issuances will have on the market price of its Class A Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of Magnolia\u2019s Class A Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or in connection with Magnolia\u2019s existing or future equity compensation plans), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of its Class A Common Stock.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of Magnolia\u2019s income or other tax returns could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nMagnolia is subject to taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities. Magnolia\u2019s future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of Magnolia\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings; or\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, Magnolia may be subject to audits of its income, sales, and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16771, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MGY"}
