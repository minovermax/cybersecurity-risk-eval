{"cik": "1487986", "company": "Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur business faces a variety of financial, operating and market risks, including the following:\nRisks Relating to the Pending Merger.\nOn July 9, 2017, we, Cincinnati Bell and Merger Sub entered into a Merger Agreement, pursuant to which we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Bell. On November 7, 2017, our stockholders approved the Merger. Assuming all closing conditions are met, we estimate the Merger to close near the middle of 2018. However, the Merger remains subject to obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions, which may delay or prevent completion of the Merger and/or result in the incurrence of additional costs. Further, certain events may delay the completion of the Merger or result in a termination of the Merger Agreement. Some of these events are outside of our control. Completion of the Merger is also conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of certain governmental consents and regulatory approvals including approval by the Federal Communications Commission and Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. No assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied. Even if all such consents and approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the consents and approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nThe failure to complete the Merger and delays completing the Merger could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFailure to complete the Merger would prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the Merger. In addition, the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether and when the Merger will be completed. Consequently, the failure to complete, or any delay in the completion of the Merger could result in a significant adverse change in the market price of our common stock, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nWhether or not the Merger is completed, the pendency of the transaction could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in our business, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company or consider other employment alternatives, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key managers and other employees;\n\u00b7 our customers may anticipate changes in how they are served and may, as a result, choose to discontinue their service or choose another provider;\n\u00b7 our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from the operation of the business toward the completion of the Merger; and\n\u00b7 the Merger Agreement contains certain negative covenants that limit how we conduct our business during the pendency of the Merger.\nThe telecommunications industry is increasingly competitive, and we may have difficulty competing effectively.\nAll sectors of the telecommunications industry are competitive. Competition in the markets in which we operate could, among other things:\n\u00b7\nreduce our customer base;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to lower prices charged to customers in order to compete; or\n\u00b7\nrequire us to increase marketing expenditures and the use of discounting and promotional campaigns.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWireline Services. As the ILEC, we face competition from resellers, local providers who lease UNEs from us, from facilities-based providers of local telephone services, and from providers of VoIP services.\nWe have historically faced access line losses as a result of competition and substitution of traditional wireline services with wireless services. Access line losses have been faced by the industry as a whole, and we cannot assure you that access line losses will not continue in the future. In particular, the increasing penetration of high-speed Internet and VoIP could lead to further primary and secondary access line losses.\nInterconnection duties are governed, in part, by telecommunications rules and regulations related to the UNEs that must be provided. These rules and regulations remain subject to ongoing modifications. Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business. However, we received some regulatory relief in 2009 when the Hawaii State Legislature passed Act 180, which classified retail local exchange intrastate services as fully competitive. While HPUC approval and cost support filings are no longer required to establish or modify rates or to bundle service offerings, HPUC approval is required to raise the rate that existed for the retail service in the tariff at the time of implementation of Act 180. In addition, while cellular wireless services initially complemented traditional local exchange and long distance services, existing and emerging wireless and IP technologies are increasingly competitive with local exchange and, particularly, long distance services in some or all of our service areas.\nInternet Services. We expect that the Internet access services business will continue to be highly competitive due to the absence of significant barriers to entry. We currently compete with a number of established online services companies, inter-exchange carriers and cable companies. Competition is particularly intense for broadband services.\nManaged Services. We face numerous competitors that vary based on the type of managed services being offered. Other network service providers provide some form of managed network service monitoring capability. Numerous voice and data equipment vendors provide management of the installed equipment either at an individual location or across multiple networked locations. Competitive managed IP and network security services are offered by various firms that specialize in this area.\nData Center and Cloud-Based Services. There currently is a limited inventory of colocation data center space available in Hawaii. However, there are numerous other providers of cloud-based software, including system integrators in Hawaii and web-based service providers, that offer software subscriptions and virtual machines on cloud-based servers housed in data centers on the U.S. mainland and internationally.\nAdvanced Communications and Network Services. These advanced services businesses are highly competitive. Many non-traditional players have emerged in the business communications market, attracted by the absence of significant barriers to entry. Many of these non-traditional players are capable of focusing on highly specialized areas of the market.\nNext-Generation Television Service. We launched our television service on the island of Oahu in July 2011. The market for television services in Hawaii is dominated by Spectrum. On the island of Oahu, approximately 70% of occupied households that subscribe to television service subscribe to Spectrum\u2019s cable service. There is no assurance we will be able to compete successfully against Spectrum. In particular, the costs to acquire programming is a significant and increasing cost, and there is no assurance our content acquisition costs will be in line with Spectrum\u2019s such that we can remain competitive. Direct broadcast satellite companies currently are not significant competitors, but this could change in the future.\nWireless Services. We provide wireless telecommunications services by use of a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) model in which we resell another carrier\u2019s facilities-based wireless services under the Hawaiian Telcom\u00ae brand name. The market in Hawaii for wireless telecommunications services is subject to intense competition. In addition, our wireless business may be less profitable than the wireless businesses of other telecommunications companies due to our use of a MVNO model.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make material capital expenditures in connection with improvements to our network and other facilities. Unforeseen increases in the amount of capital expenditures required to execute our current business plan could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures to, among other things, enhance the capabilities of our network, such as that required to provide digital video service, enhance the functionality of our existing IT systems, and support the deployment of new products and services. We intend to fund future capital expenditures and expenses with operating cash flows and funds available to us under our credit facilities. Increases in the amount of capital expenditures and expenses required to upgrade our network and other facilities above those contemplated by our current business plan, could cause our cash flows and available financing to be insufficient to fund such capital expenditures and operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nFailures in our critical back-office systems and IT infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe operate our own back-office and IT infrastructure, including business processes, software applications (such as billing systems, corporate finance systems, human resources and payroll systems and customer relationship management systems), and hardware that are vital to our operations. Failures in our back-office systems and IT infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.\nOur success depends upon the talents and efforts of our senior management team. The loss of any member of our senior management team, due to retirement or otherwise, and the inability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nAn IT and/or network security breach may lead to unauthorized use or disabling of our network, theft of customer data, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to cyber and other data security risks. This risk may be heightened as we expand our managed services, data center services, and cloud-based services. We seek to effectively prevent, detect and respond to all cyber-attacks, but, in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude. Significant security failures could result in the theft, loss, damage, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information; the theft, loss, damage, unauthorized use or publication of our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information, intellectual property and/or confidential business information; or the unauthorized use or disabling of our network elements. While we have technology and information security processes and cybersecurity risk managment in place to mitigate these risks and respond to any incidents, there is no assurance these measures will be adequate to prevent an incident, including incidents involving sophisticated criminal organizations and nation-state actors. A disabling of our network elements or a loss of confidential or proprietary data or other data security breaches could materially and adversely affect our customers, employees and vendors, damage our reputation among customers and the public, disrupt operations, and subject us to possible financial losses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to expand our services.\nA network disruption could cause delays or interruptions of service, which could cause us to lose customers.\nTo be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers with reliable and uninterrupted service over our expanded network. Disruptions in our service could occur as a result of events that are beyond our control. Some of the risks to our network and infrastructure include, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nphysical damage to our transmission network including poles, cable and access lines;\n\u00b7\nwidespread power surges or outages;\n\u00b7\nsoftware defects in critical systems; and\n\u00b7\ndamage or disruption inflicted by third parties, whether intentionally or unintentionally, upon the network or our other infrastructure.\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we have experienced and in the future may experience short disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, inclement weather and service failures of our third-party service providers. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future. In addition, certain portions of our network may lack adequate redundancy to allow for expedient recovery of service to affected customers. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and incur expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nWe rely on several material outsourcing agreements to operate our business. The loss of certain of these agreements, or the failure of any third party to perform under certain of these agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nSeveral critical services necessary to operate our business are provided by third-party service providers. For example, we have entered into agreements with Accenture and other third parties for the provision of, among other things, critical printing, billing, and IT services.\nUpon expiration or termination of these agreements, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, favorable to us, or at all. The failure of these third-party service providers to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us, without a suitable replacement, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if these third-party service providers were to seek U.S. bankruptcy law protection, our agreements with such service providers, and such service providers\u2019 ability to provide the services under those agreements, could be adversely impacted, and although we may have a claim for damages against the bankruptcy estate, the claim may or may not be paid in the bankruptcy proceeding.\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental regulation. Applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe operate in a heavily regulated industry, and most of our revenues come from the provision of services regulated by the FCC and the HPUC. Laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts and could be changed by federal or state legislative initiative, judicial review or regulatory agencies at any time. We cannot predict the impact of future developments or changes to the regulatory environment or the impact such developments or changes would have on us.\nThe \u201cConnect America Fund\u201d Order adopted by the FCC in November 2011 comprehensively reformed both the universal service program and intercarrier compensation and has had a significant impact on us. See \u201c-Universal Service\u201d above for a discussion of the impact of the Order on the universal service program, and \u201c-Federal Framework for Intercarrier Compensation\u201d above for a discussion of the impact of the Order on intercarrier compensation. Changes in other FCC policies under review also could have a significant impact on us by increasing our obligations and/or reducing our revenue.\nState government regulation also is a source of business uncertainty. We cannot predict whether state proceedings will be initiated or the possible outcome of such proceedings at this time.\nThe HPUC could limit the ability of Hawaiian Telcom, Inc., one of our indirect operating subsidiaries, to distribute funds or assets to its parent company.\nAll of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Any revenue we may receive is derived from distributions from such subsidiaries. Hawaiian Telcom, Inc., one of our indirect operating subsidiaries, is subject to HPUC regulatory authority which could potentially limit the ability of Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. to distribute funds or assets to its parent company. The inability of any of our regulated subsidiaries to make a distribution would, thus, limit the ability and amount of funds available for us to make a distribution to our stockholders.\nA reduction by the HPUC or the FCC of the rates we charge our customers would reduce our revenues and could reduce our earnings.\nThe rates we charge our local telephone customers are based, in part, on a rate-of-return authorized by the HPUC on capital invested in our network. These authorized rates, as well as allowable investment and expenses, are subject to review and change by the HPUC at any time. If the HPUC orders us to reduce our rates, our revenues would be reduced and our earnings also could be reduced absent corresponding reductions in costs or offsetting revenue increases in other segments. We cannot assure you that our rates will remain at their current levels. The HPUC order received in connection with the 2007 sale of our directories publishing business imposed a condition requiring the imputation of revenues. Specifically, a directory publishing revenue credit in the annual amount of $42.6 million per year must be added as regulated revenues into the calculation of Hawaiian Telcom, Inc.\u2019s earnings from 2008 to 2022 in all future rate cases, alternative form of regulation proceedings, or other proceedings before the HPUC investigating Hawaiian Telcom, Inc.\u2019s earnings or financial performance. This condition may adversely affect our ability to obtain rate increases in the future.\nAlso, our local exchange service competitors may gain a competitive advantage based on rules which favor competitors. For example, competitors have the ability to purchase our services at discounted rates set by the HPUC and to resell them at rates that are not subject to the level of regulatory scrutiny generally faced by us. Additionally, as a result of the state regulators permitting our competitors to intervene in rate-setting or other regulatory proceedings, there is a potential that such competitors could obtain business sensitive information about us during such proceedings.\nThe FCC approves tariffs for interstate access and subscriber line charges, both of which are components of our network access revenue. The \u201cConnect America Fund\u201d Order that the FCC adopted in November 2011 reduces switched interstate access charges for carriers like us over a period of six years but allows us to recover some of the foregone revenue from our end users. It is possible we may be required to recover more revenue through subscriber line charges or forego this revenue altogether. This could reduce our revenue or impair our competitive position.\nIf we do not adapt to technological changes in the telecommunications industry, we could lose customers and market share.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards which could reduce the competitiveness of our services. Adapting to technological developments could require unbudgeted upgrades or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming to implement. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to important new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and sell new services to our existing customers.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends.\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operations. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we develop our own technologies, products and services and rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. Even unsuccessful claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our businesses. In recent years, the number of intellectual property infringement claims has been increasing in the communications industry and this could negatively impact us as a company.\nThe failure to renegotiate programming contracts with television content providers on acceptable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe expect television content costs to continue to be one of our largest operating costs associated with providing television service. In recent years, the cable industry has experienced rapid increases in the cost of programming, especially the costs for sports programming and for local broadcast station retransmission content.\nProgramming costs are generally assessed on a per-subscriber basis, and therefore, are related directly to the number of subscribers to which the programming is provided. Our relatively small base of subscribers limits our ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs. As our programming contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms or that they will be renewed at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such programming as part of our video services packages. The loss of this content could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe geographic concentration of our operations in Hawaii make our business susceptible to local economic and regulatory conditions and consumer trends, and an economic downturn, recession or unfavorable legislative or regulatory action affecting Hawaii could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our outstanding securities.\nSubstantially all of our customers and operations are located in Hawaii. Because of Hawaii\u2019s geographic isolation, the successful operation and growth of our businesses is dependent on favorable economic and regulatory conditions in the state. The Hawaii economy, in turn, is dependent upon many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe level of government and military spending;\n\u00b7\nthe legal, regulatory and political environment;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of the Hawaii tourism industry, which is in turn dependent on global economic conditions principally those in the U.S. mainland and Pacific rim;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and cost of skilled labor;\n\u00b7\nthe continued growth in services industries; and\n\u00b7\nthe absence of hurricanes or other natural disasters and terrorism incidents.\nThe customer base for telecommunications services in Hawaii is small and geographically concentrated. The population of Hawaii is approximately 1.4 million, approximately 70% of whom live on the island of Oahu. Any adverse economic conditions affecting Oahu, or Hawaii generally, could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Labor shortages or increased labor costs in Hawaii could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we may be subject to increased costs for goods and services that it is unable to control or defray. Increased expenses including, but not limited to, energy and health care could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLimitations on our ability to use NOL carryforwards, and other factors requiring us to pay cash to satisfy our tax liabilities in future periods, may affect our ability to fund our operations, make capital expenditures and repay our indebtedness.\nWe currently have a material amount of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and so-called \u201cbuilt-in losses,\u201d all of which we intend to use in the future to reduce our federal and state taxable income. In the event that an \u201cownership change\u201d were to occur with respect to our stock, such as the completion of the Merger, it is possible that our ability to use our NOLs and built-in losses would become subject to an annual limitation. An ownership change could occur with respect to our stock merely as a result of one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d buying or selling our shares, even if no one person were to acquire a controlling percentage of our stock. Although we will monitor transfers of our stock, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer an ownership change with substantial adverse tax consequences.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. We maintain a Term Loan in the amount of $320 million and a revolving credit facility which may be drawn in an amount up to $30 million (Revolving Credit Facility), each with a first priority lien on all assets.\nThe debt service requirements of our indebtedness could:\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy the service requirements of our other obligations, including pension funding obligations, investments required to maintain and upgrade our network and service fleet, investments required to introduce and deploy new products and services, as well as the operating costs of our businesses;\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a higher than desired portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nmake it difficult to secure credit terms with our vendors;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nIn addition, the terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests and restrict the payment of dividends. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts.\nThe Term Loan matures in 2019. We generally do not expect to generate the necessary cash flow to repay our Term Loan in its entirety by the maturity date and such repayment in full is dependent upon the ability to refinance the Term Loan on reasonable terms. The ability to refinance the indebtedness on reasonable terms before the maturity date cannot be assured.\nTo service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our current indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We will likely need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to operate our business and pursue our business strategies, and a breach of such covenants may result in the acceleration of our long- term debt maturities.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility and under the New Facility limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or to make certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u00b7\nsell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u00b7\nmake capital expenditures; and\n\u00b7\nincur liens.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants may prohibit us from prepaying our other indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control.\nSevere weather conditions and natural disasters which occur in Hawaii could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nFrom time to time, Hawaii experiences severe weather conditions such as high winds and heavy rainfall, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunami, which can overwhelm our employees, disrupt our services and severely damage our property. Such disruptions in service and damage to property could materially decrease our revenues and materially increase our expenses. For example, in 2015, seven hurricanes and six tropical storms passed near Hawaii, resulting in record rainfall which damaged infrastructure and adversely affected our financial results. In 2016, one tropical storm and two hurricanes either made landfall or passed near Hawaii causing heavy rainfall and high surf. While these events did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition, we cannot assure you that these types of events will not become more common or severe in the future or not result in material harm to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or the market price of our securities. Moreover, it is impossible to predict the extent to which climate change could cause extreme weather conditions to become more frequent or more extreme.\nConcentration of ownership among stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, two of our stockholders collectively (with their affiliates) own approximately 45% of our outstanding common stock. Each of these two stockholder groups filed a Schedule 13D in 2015 indicating that it may, among other things, engage in communications with our representatives or other stockholders of the Company, purchase additional shares of Company common stock or propose directors for our Board of Directors. In 2016, we entered into a Nomination, Standstill and Support Agreement with our largest stockholder, Black Diamond Capital Management, L.L.C. (BD), and a Nomination, Standstill and Support Agreement(collectively, the Standstill Agreements) with our second largest beneficial stockholder, Twin Haven Capital Partners, L.L.C., Twin Haven Special Opportunities Fund III, L.P., Twin Haven Special Opportunities Partners III, L.L.C., Twin Haven Special Opportunities Fund IV, L.P. and Twin Haven Special Opportunities Partners IV, L.L.C. (collectively, Twin Haven). Pursuant to each of the Standstill Agreements, among other things, we agreed to nominate one designee of each of BD and Twin Haven to our Board of Directors at each of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 annual meetings of stockholders. In return, each of BD and Twin Haven has agreed during the three-year term, among other things, to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to us and our securities (including soliciting proxies, proposing any sale transaction or tender offer, seeking representation on our Board of Directors in excess of one designee, or acquiring additional shares of Company common stock beyond an agreed-upon level) and, subject to limited exceptions, to vote all of its shares in accordance with the recommendation of our Board of Directors on any matter submitted for stockholder approval. Although the Standstill Agreements limit BD\u2019s and Twin Haven\u2019s influence over us, each of our major stockholders still has significant influence on the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if these stockholders are not acting in a coordinated manner, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders, or more likely with the support of these stockholders, and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control may otherwise benefit our other stockholders.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales, or the availability for sale in the public market, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. Additionally, the high concentration of ownership of our stock could increase the risk that such a large block sale could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, may also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital by selling equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.", "PERMNO": 12916, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "HCOM"}
