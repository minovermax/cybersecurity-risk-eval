{"cik": "890908", "company": "DYNACQ HEALTHCARE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe value of an investment in Dynacq Healthcare, Inc. is subject to significant risks, certain of which are specific to our Company, others are inherent in our business and the industry in which we operate, and still others are market related. If any of the matters described in the risk factors listed below were to occur, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. The Risk Factors described below apply to the current operations and market for the common stock of the Company, and do not address risks that may arise in the future.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe continue to incur substantial losses, and we have no current prospect of generating operating profits.\nFor the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2014, our business generated a net loss of approximately $3.8 million in each year. In recent years, our net patient revenues have declined, relative to historical levels, due to declines in patient referrals. While we continue to seek out additional sources of patient referrals, we have not been able to realize the substantial increase in patient referrals we require in order to generate the revenues needed to offset our operating losses. Our industry is highly competitive, and we have not been able to identify and execute any business plan that might result in an operating profit. We are currently evaluating strategic alternatives in an attempt to reverse our historical trend of operating losses, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to reverse this trend. If we are unable to generate positive net income on a consistent basis going forward, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nOur cash reserves cannot continue to support the level of losses we have incurred in recent years.\nAs of August 31, 2015, we had approximately $18.8 million in net assets, including approximately $15.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, available for continuing operations. These reserves are being steadily depleted by our losses, which totaled approximately $44.1 million in our last five fiscal years. If we are unsuccessful in implementing an alternative business plan to increase revenues and improve performance, or are otherwise required to continue to use a substantial portion of our current assets in order to continue our day to day operations, then our continued operations will not be sustainable.\nA significant percentage of our revenues are generated through relatively few physicians.\nFor the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, approximately 84% of our gross revenues were generated from six surgeons. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, approximately 84% of our gross revenues were generated from five surgeons. The loss of physicians who provide significant net patient revenues for the Company may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial uninsured liabilities for which we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses.\nAlthough we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe to be appropriate for our operations, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient or continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. Our professional malpractice liability insurance has covered the majority of malpractice and related legal claims to date; however, the cost of defending shareholder derivative suits and/or shareholder oppression claims and any damages awarded as a result of these claims, are paid by the Company. In addition, the large monetary claims and significant defense costs involved in many of the malpractice claims may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage. If one or more successful claims against us were not covered by or exceeded the coverage of our insurance, we could be adversely affected. We do not employ any of the physicians who conduct procedures at our hospitals, and the governing documents of each of our hospitals require physicians who conduct procedures at our hospitals to maintain stated amounts of insurance.\nWe indemnify our directors and officers against certain liabilities and do not presently carry director and officer liability insurance.\nAs permitted under Nevada law and pursuant to our governing documents and indemnification agreements with certain of our officers and directors, we indemnify our directors and officers against monetary damages, including advancing expenses, to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law. We do not carry director and officer liability insurance, so our assets are at risk in the event of successful claims against us or our officers and directors. Our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy judgments against us and our officers and directors in the event of such successful claims. In addition, our lack of director and officer liability insurance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified directors and officers in the future.\nWe are dependent on the services of our Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Company's future success will depend upon its ability to retain the services of its Chief Executive Officer. The Company does not have a written employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer providing for specific terms of employment, and does not carry any key man life insurance. The Company's loss of its Chief Executive Officer, especially if the loss is without advance notice, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe hold accounts with certain financial institutions that exceed the FDIC and SIPC insurance limits in the U.S. and Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board insurance limits in Hong Kong.\nThe Company has financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk and consist primarily of cash investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company routinely maintains cash and temporary cash investments at certain financial institutions in amounts substantially in excess of (a) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\"SIPC\") insurance limits in the U.S. and (b) Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board (\u201cHKDPB\u201d) insurance limits in Hong Kong. At August 31, 2015, the Company had cash balances in excess of the FDIC and SIPC limits in the U.S. and HKDPB limits in Hong Kong of $13.9 million. Management believes that these financial institutions are of high quality and the risk of loss is minimal. However, if any of these financial institutions were to fail and we were unable to recover our cash balances, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuation.\nBecause we have total assets of approximately $9.6 million which are denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar (USD), we have foreign currency exchange risk. The U.S. dollar (USD) has experienced volatility in world markets recently. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, fluctuation in the Euro - Hong Kong dollar exchange rate resulted in exchange losses of $400,162 and $21,319, respectively, which are included in rent and other income in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur investments in marketable securities in foreign markets are subject to a high degree of risk and differences in market conditions than those in the U.S.\nWe have significant unrealized gains on our investments in available-for-sale securities. Approximately 30% of our assets as of August 31, 2015 are represented by foreign investment securities, which are generally less liquid, more volatile and harder to value than U.S. securities. These foreign investments are subject to unique risks such as currency risk, political, social and economic risk, and foreign market and trading risk. Foreign investments may be affected by political, social or economic events occurring in a country where the bonds are invested, which could cause the investments in that country to experience gains or losses. Lack of public information and uniform auditing, accounting and financial reporting standards in foreign countries make disclosure of investment information different from that available from domestic issuers. The trading markets for these investments are significantly less active than U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Because of these risks, and others, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s investments in securities in foreign markets will retain or increase in value or can be liquidated at a price or time favorable to the Company.\nRisks Associated with our Industry\nThe Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d) may have a significant impact on our existing and future operations.\nThe ACA, as well as other health reform legislation and regulation, may have a significant impact on our existing and future operations in that it will extend insurance coverage through Medicaid or private insurance to a broader segment of the U.S. population. Many provision of the ACA became effective on January 1, 2014. The continued development of Accountable Care Organizations may limit our ability to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries and other changes to the law implemented as part of health care reform could further restrict the care we are able to offer patients. The current economic climate as well as efforts to reduce healthcare costs could reduce the reimbursement we receive for the services we do provide and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOne key provision of the ACA is the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain \u201cminimum essential\u201d health insurance coverage. For individuals who are not exempt from the individual mandate, and who do not receive health insurance through an employer or government program, the means of satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private company or an insurance exchange. Beginning in 2014, individuals who are enrolled in a health benefits plan purchased through an exchange may be eligible for a premium credit or cost-sharing subsidy. Federal court cases are still pending on whether the government can subsidize health insurance premiums under the ACA.\nThe \u201cemployer mandate\u201d provision of the ACA requires the imposition of penalties on employers having 50 or more employees who do not offer affordable health insurance coverage to those employees working 30 or more hours per week. In 2013, the imposition of these penalties was delayed until January 1, 2015. In 2014, the employer mandate was further delayed until January 1, 2016. Based on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, we do not believe that the delays in implementation of the employer mandate will have a measureable effect on the number of people insured.\nAlthough we are unable to predict the precise impact of the individual and employer mandates on our future operations, and while there have been and will continue to be some reductions in reimbursement rates by government payers, we anticipate, based on the current timetable for implementing the law, that we may begin to have a positive impact from the increased number of insured patients.\nAnother key provision of the ACA is the expansion of Medicaid coverage. The expansion of the Medicaid program (substantially all of which will be funded initially by the federal government) requires each state legislature to take action. To date, Texas has chosen not to expand its Medicaid program through this mechanism. However, Texas has expanded its Medicaid program through the 1115 Medicaid Waiver program. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission has received federal approval of a waiver that allows the state to expand Medicaid managed care while preserving hospital funding, provides incentive payments for health care improvements and directs more funding to hospitals that serve large numbers of uninsured patients. While we are unable to predict the precise impact of 1115 Medicaid Waiver program on our future operations, it may be that we are able to receive reimbursement for caring for uninsured and underinsured patients through this program.\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive laws and complex government regulations applicable to us, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe U.S. healthcare industry is highly regulated and must comply with extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Hospitals must meet requirements for licensure and certification to participate in government programs and accreditation. In addition, there are regulatory requirements related to areas such as adequacy and quality of medical care, relationships with physicians and other referral sources (Anti-kickback Statute and Stark law, for example), qualifications of medical and support personnel, billing for services, confidentiality of medical records, emergency care and compliance with building codes. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these extensive government laws and regulations, if we fail to comply with any of the laws or regulations we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, and our facilities could lose their licenses and their ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs. In addition, government laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws and regulations, may change. In that case, we may have to make changes in our facility, equipment, personnel, services or business structures so that our facility may remain licensed and qualified to participate in federal and state programs. If the rules governing reimbursement are revised or interpreted in a different manner or if a determination is made that we did not comply with these requirements, we could be subject to denials of payment or recoupment of payments already received for services provided to patients.\nSpecifically, the federal Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark law are very broad in scope, and many of their provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted. See Business - Government Regulation for an in- depth description of those statutes. If the ownership distributions paid to physicians by our hospital is found to constitute prohibited payments made to physicians under the Anti-kickback Statute, physician self-referral or other fraud and abuse laws, our business may be adversely affected. Other companies within the healthcare industry continue to be the subject of federal and state investigations that could increase the risk that we may become subject to similar investigations in the future.\nIf laws governing the corporate practice of medicine change, we may be required to restructure some of our relationships.\nThe laws of various states in which we operate or may operate in the future do not or may not permit business corporations to practice medicine, exercise control over physicians who practice medicine or engage in various business practices, such as fee-splitting with physicians. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. A government agency charged with enforcement of these laws, or a private party, might assert that our arrangements with physicians and physician group practices do not comply with applicable corporate practice of medicine laws. If our arrangements with these physicians and physician group practices were deemed to violate state corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting or similar laws, or if new laws were enacted rendering these arrangements illegal, we may be required to restructure our relationships with physicians and physician groups, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges to the Fee Guidelines for Texas workers\u2019 compensation cases have resulted in lower reimbursement and may result in a decrease in the number of those type of procedures performed.\nThe Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation 2008 Acute Care Hospital Outpatient and Inpatient Facility Fee Guidelines which became effective March 1, 2008 establish reimbursement amounts for workers\u2019 compensation procedures performed at our facilities. Those amounts are determined by applying the most recently adopted and effective Medicare reimbursement formula and factors as published annually in the Federal Register, including identifying the appropriate Ambulatory Payment Classification for outpatient services provided, or Diagnosis Related Group for inpatient services provided. The applicable classification or group is used to determine the maximum allowable reimbursement for the procedures performed unless not calculable using Guidelines, in which case reimbursement will be determined on a fair and reasonable basis. Based on these new Guidelines, the reimbursement due the Company for workers\u2019 compensation cases is lower than we previously experienced. Our net patient service revenues attributable to Texas workers\u2019 compensation cases as a percentage of gross billings have decreased and may continue to decrease as a result of lower reimbursement rates for workers\u2019 compensation procedures still being performed.\nOur revenues may be negatively affected by a reduction in payments from third-party payers, a shift in the surgical mix, government cost controls and/or other circumstances over which we have no control.\nWe are dependent upon private and governmental third-party sources of payment for the services provided to patients in our hospital. The amount of payment our hospital receives for its services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including federal and state regulations and the cost containment and utilization decisions of third-party payers. The Company\u2019s decision to participate in certain managed care contracts may not result in an increase in patient revenues if we are unable to obtain favorable managed care contracts, we are excluded from participation in a managed care contract, or the reimbursement rate for the procedure performed is too low.\nFurther, complicated reimbursement rules that are subject to interpretation may subject us to denials of payment for services provided or to recoupments of payments already received. We have no control over the number of patients that are referred to our hospital annually or whether such patients will be admitted as inpatients, which typically have a higher reimbursement rate per procedure, or outpatients. Fixed fee schedules, capitation payment arrangements, exclusion from participation in managed care programs or other factors affecting payments for healthcare services over which we do not have control could also cause a reduction in our revenues.\nWe are dependent upon the good reputation of our physicians.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon quality medical services being rendered by our physicians. Any negative publicity, whether from civil litigation, allegations of criminal misconduct, or forfeiture of medical licenses, with respect to any of our physicians and/or our facilities could adversely affect our results of operations. This could occur through the loss of a physician who provides significant revenue to the Company, or decisions by patients to use different physicians or facilities with respect to their healthcare needs. Several years ago Dynacq was the subject of negative publicity in news reports focusing on its Pasadena facility, which harmed its business and reputation. As the patient-physician relationship involves inherent trust and confidence, any negative publicity adversely affecting the reputation of our physicians or our facilities would likely adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur hospital faces competition for patients from other hospitals and healthcare providers.\nThe healthcare business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by most U.S. hospitals provide services similar to those offered by our hospital. In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals and surgery and diagnostic centers in the geographic area in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, our hospital operates in an increasingly competitive environment. Some of the hospitals that compete with our hospital are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments and charitable contributions and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. Increasingly, we are facing competition by physician-owned freestanding surgery centers that compete for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their healthcare facilities, we may experience a decline in patient volume.\nOur hospital faces competition for staffing, which may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nOur operations are dependent on the effort, abilities and experience of the management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and medical support personnel responsible for the day-to-day operations of our hospital. In the U.S. market, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers. This shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMarket Risks Related to Our Stock\nA stockholder controls a majority of our outstanding shares.\nMrs. Ella Chan, wife of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Chiu Chan, individually and as the sole trustee of Chiu M. Chan Family Trust, beneficially owns an aggregate of approximately 61.7% of our outstanding common stock. As the majority stockholder, she is able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of any directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Further, our governing documents provide that two-thirds constitutes a super-majority of our common stock. A super-majority has the ability to, among other things, remove members of our Board of Directors for cause or for no cause at all. Mrs. Chan together with her son, Eric K. Chan, our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially own 63.7% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they would only need a small number of additional votes to achieve a super-majority. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control, or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The interests of Ella Chan and/or Eric Chan may conflict with those of other stockholders. In the event that either elects to sell significant amounts of common stock in the future, such sales could depress the market price of our common stock, further increasing the volatility of our trading market.\nWe have no independent directors, and no separate board committees.\nSince October 30, 2012, our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Chan, is the sole member of our Board of Directors. As a result, we no longer have any independent directors to evaluate our decisions, nor do we have any committees of our Board comprised of independent directors, including audit, nominating and compensation committees. Although we are not required by rules or regulations applicable to us to have independent directors or such committees, corporate governance measures such as the presence of independent directors and the establishment of committees comprised of independent directors may be beneficial to our stockholders. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by members of the Board who have a direct interest in the outcome. Although we anticipate seeking new independent directors in the future, there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will be successful in appointing any new directors. Moreover, while the inclusion of independent directors to our Board and the adoption of certain other corporate governance measures could benefit our stockholders, there can be no assurance that these measures would be effective even if independent directors are appointed to our Board and these governance measures are implemented.\nNASDAQ delisted our common stock effective October 22, 2012, and prior to that had placed a trading halt since August 9, 2012, which is likely to affect your ability to sell shares of our common stock and the price you may receive for our common stock.\nNASDAQ delisted the common stock of our Company effective October 22, 2012. Prior to that, trading in the Company\u2019s stock was halted by NASDAQ since August 9, 2012. The Company\u2019s common stock is eligible to trade in the \u201cGrey Market.\u201d Grey Market securities do not have bid or ask quotations in the OTC Link system or the OTCBB. Broker-dealers must report Grey Market trades to FINRA, so trade data is available on http://www.otcmarkets.com and other public sources. Generally, trading in the Grey Market is much more limited than trading on NASDAQ. As such, our common stock being delisted from NASDAQ has severely decreased the liquidity of the shares of common stock that you own.\nHistorically, there was only limited trading activity in our securities, and we have had a relatively small public float compared to the number of our shares outstanding. Additionally, as a result of the delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ, the ability of stockholders to trade any shares has been severely impeded. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which investors' interest in our common stock will provide an active and liquid trading market. Due to our limited public float, we may be vulnerable to investors taking a \"short position\" in our common stock, which would likely have a depressing effect on the price of our common stock and add increased volatility to our trading market. Furthermore, we have been, and in the future may be subject to, class action lawsuits that further increase market volatility. The volatility of the market for our common stock could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, investors must be able to bear the financial risk of losing their entire investment in our common stock.\nFuture issuance of additional shares of our stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect our stock price.\nIn addition to approximately 86.5 million additional shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue, our Board of Directors may issue up to five million shares of preferred stock which may have greater rights than our common stock, without seeking approval from holders of our common stock. In addition, we are obligated to issue an aggregate of approximately 772,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of options outstanding under our 2000 and 2011 Incentive Plan. None of these options have an exercise price which is lower than the market price. The shares that could be issued upon exercise of the outstanding options represent approximately 6% of our currently outstanding shares of common stock. Additional shares are subject to options not yet granted under the Year 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, and we may grant additional options or warrants in the future to purchase shares of our common stock not under the plan. The exercise price of each option granted under our option plan is equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, although that price may be substantially less than the value per share on the date of exercise.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nIt has been our policy to use all available funds from operations to improve and expand our current facilities and to acquire new facilities. For that reason, we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no present intention to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore an investor in our common stock should not expect to obtain any economic benefit from owning our common stock prior to a sale of those shares, if then.", "PERMNO": 79580, "SIC": 8060, "TIC": "DYII"}
