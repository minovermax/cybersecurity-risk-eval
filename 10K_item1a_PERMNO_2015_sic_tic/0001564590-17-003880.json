This section discusses factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nWe note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties applicable to our business.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe face the following risks related to the general conditions and trends of the industry in which we operate:\nWe rely predominantly on contracts with U.S. government entities, and the loss or delay of a significant number of our contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revenue is derived predominantly from providing services under contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. government. Although these various agencies and prime contractors are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors, our customers exercise independent purchasing decisions. The loss or delay of all or a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Approximately 99% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was attributable directly or indirectly to U.S. government departments and agencies. Aggregate revenue from our ten largest contracts amounted to approximately $590 million, or 28%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets, our backlog and future financial results may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of the U.S. government\u2019s use of services providers, including curtailment due to government budget reductions and related fiscal matters;\n\u2022\nthe existence of overseas contingency operations and other geopolitical events that affect demand for our services; and\n\u2022\nlonger lead times for the government to fully fund awarded contracts.\nThe U.S. government continues to experience a substantial delay in its contract actions, which has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, delays of new awards we depend on for new or increased revenue or a delay in our receipt of revenue under these awards. These delays are caused by a number of factors, including uncertainty among our customers regarding the availability of funds to procure new programs and services, and other factors related to, but not limited to, recent budget and sequestration uncertainties and activities, as discussed below.\nFinally, the government services marketplace is characterized by contracts of shorter duration as compared to large production and systems integration programs. Services contracts may, including options, extend to ten or fifteen years, but most usually last five years or less.\nFuture declines in the U.S. defense budget, or future government shutdowns or a failure to increase the debt ceiling, could result in a material decrease in our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant percentage of our government contracts and revenue are dependent upon the U.S. defense budget, which is subject to the congressional budget authorization and appropriations process. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year basis, even though contract periods of performance may extend over many years. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract is usually partially funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by Congress in future fiscal years. DoD budgets are a function of several factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in U.S. government procurement policies, budget considerations, current and future economic conditions, presidential administration priorities, changing national security and defense requirements, geopolitical developments and actual fiscal year congressional appropriations for defense budgets. Any of these factors could result in a significant decline in, or redirection of, current and future DoD budgets and impact our future results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. Government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For many programs, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years. Consequently, programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the annual budget process ultimately approved by Congress or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions, as applicable.\nPlans adopted by the U.S. Government, along with pressures on, and uncertainty surrounding, the Federal budget, sequestration, the appropriations process, and the permissible Federal debt limit, could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers. In the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable, or is reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government or the prime contractor.\nIn 2016, U.S. government revenue accounted for approximately 99% of our total revenue. Aggregate revenue from our ten largest contracts amounted to approximately $590 million, or 28%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our revenues from the U.S. government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various U.S. government programs, principally related to national defense, intelligence and homeland security. The funding of our programs is subject to the overall U.S. government policies, budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geopolitical events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling.\nIn recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. In 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which established specific limits on annual appropriations for fiscal years (FY) 2012-2021. The BCA has been amended a number of times, most recently by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA). As a result, DoD funding levels have fluctuated over this period and have been difficult to predict. For example, the DoD budget was reduced by 7.8% in FY 2013 as compared to FY 2012, but remained essentially flat for FY 2014 and 2015. The BBA raised DoD FY 2016 funding approximately 5% relative to FY 2015, but the ultimate DoD funding for FY 2017 remains uncertain because the DoD is currently operating under a Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY 2017, which expires in April 2017. The CR limits funding levels to FY 2016 and does not authorize new spending initiatives. Future spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes, depending on Congressional action. In addition, in recent years the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both a governmental shut-down and CRs to extend sufficient funds only for U.S. government agencies to continue operating. Additionally, the national debt has recently threatened to reach the statutory debt ceiling, and such an event in future years could result in the U.S. government defaulting on its debts. Significant delays or reductions in appropriations, an extended debt ceiling breach, and/or future budget and program decisions may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe DoD\u2019s wide-ranging efficiencies initiative, which targets affordability and cost growth, could have a material effect on the procurement process and may adversely affect our existing contracts and the awards of new contracts.\nThe U.S. government has issued guidance regarding changes to the procurement process that is intended to control cost growth throughout the acquisition cycle by developing a competitive strategy for each program. As a result, we expect to engage in more frequent negotiations and re-competitions on a cost or price analysis basis with most competitive bids in which we participate. This initiative is organized into five major areas: affordability and cost growth; productivity and innovation; competition; services acquisition; and processes and bureaucracy. Because this initiative has significantly changed the way the U.S. government solicits, negotiates and manages its contracts, this initiative has resulted in a reduction in expenditures for services we provide to the U.S. government. These initiatives may adversely affect our existing contracts and awards of new contracts and our results of operations and cash flow.\nBusinesses that we may acquire may fail to perform to expectations, and we may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing business.\nAcquisitions of assets or entities designed to accelerate the implementation of our strategic plan have been an important element of our long-term strategy. Pursuant to this strategy, we closed on the acquisition of TASC on February 26, 2015. The acquisition and integration of businesses such as TASC involve a number of risks.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a substantial portion of the anticipated benefits of the TASC acquisition or other future acquisitions that we may consummate. TASC and other future acquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations, including expected levels of revenue, and may require unanticipated costs and expenditures. In addition, following completion of the TASC acquisition or other future acquisitions, we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business have achieved or might achieve separately. TASC and other acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence, including the failure of a target company to have fulfilled its contractual obligations to the U.S. government or other customers, which may result in additional financial responsibility, harm to our reputation or other adverse effects caused by such liabilities or issues. In addition, the integration of TASC and other newly acquired businesses may be expensive and time-consuming and may not be entirely successful. Integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting. Future acquired businesses can also raise potential organizational conflicts of interest issues that can impact the nature and timing of the acquisition or our ability to compete for future contracts where the acquired company may have been involved. In addition, the process of integrating future acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel. If we are unable to integrate newly acquired businesses successfully or if TASC or other acquired businesses fail to produce targeted results, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe assumed significant debt in connection with our acquisitions of TASC and DRC, and we may incur additional debt in the future. Such debt could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with our acquisition of TASC, we incurred and/or assumed approximately $1.2 billion in debt, including the assumption of approximately $623 million of existing TASC debt, to refinance our existing debt and to finance a portion of a special cash dividend to our stockholders in connection with the acquisition of TASC along with the transaction fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of TASC. During 2014, we incurred and/or assumed approximately $190 million in debt to finance the repayment of approximately $86 million in existing DRC debt. We currently depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. The total principal and cash interest payments on our debt in 2017 is approximately $93 million, and as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $48 million in cash on hand. We expect to be able to meet the estimated principal and interest payments on our debt through a combination of cash on hand and expected cash flows from operations. Additionally, we may incur further debt in the future for other corporate purposes.\nThe potentially significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations that could result from our substantial debt include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\ninstances in which we are unable to meet the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, which circumstances would have the potential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nthe allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thus reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital expenditures, that could improve our competitive position, results of operations or share price;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;\n\u2022\ncompromising our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we could be put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors that do not have as much debt as we do and competitors that may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to execute business development and acquisition activities to support our strategies; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to refinance our substantial indebtedness on more favorable terms.\nOur use of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may become limited as a result of the transaction or future transactions in our stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have estimated net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for U.S. Federal income tax purposes of at least $445 million and an adjusted tax basis in our amortizable goodwill and other intangible assets of at least $1.0 billion. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as its adjusted tax basis in its amortizable goodwill, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative increase in ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. If a corporation has a \u201cnet unrealized built-in loss,\u201d generally meaning that, immediately before an ownership change, the fair market value of its assets was less than the aggregate tax basis of its assets, then any \u201cbuilt-in loss\u201d recognized during the first five years after the change date (including through amortization deductions) may be limited. In connection with the closing of the TASC transaction, TASC received an opinion from a major national accounting firm to the effect that the business combination involving TASC, taken together with the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and occurring on the closing date and taking into account the issuance of the maximum number of shares of Engility common stock issuable following the closing in respect of equity awards outstanding under the Engility stock plans as of the closing date, will not result in an ownership change of TASC within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Code and that TASC will not have had a cumulative owner shift under Section 382 of the Code of more than 49.1 percentage points during the \u201ctesting period\u201d (as defined in Section 382(i) of the Code) ending on the closing date after giving effect to the business combination and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and taking into account the issuance of the maximum number of shares of Engility common stock issuable following the closing in respect of equity awards outstanding under the Engility stock plans as of the closing date. It was a condition to our obligation to complete the business combination that such opinion be in form and substance reasonably\nacceptable to us. The opinion neither binds the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) nor precludes the IRS from adopting a contrary position. In the event that the IRS were to determine that the business combination caused an ownership change with respect to TASC to occur on the effective date of the business combination, Section 382 of the Code would apply to limit our use of any remaining net operating losses and other pre-change tax attributes after the effective date of the business combination. Usage of our NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes after the effective date of the business combination would also be adversely affected if an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code were to occur after the effective date of the business combination. In order to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change after the effective date of the business combination, our common stock is generally subject to certain transfer restrictions as set forth in our charter and as described below under \u201cAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, and restrictions on our charter related to our acquisition of TASC, could delay or prevent a change in control\u201d. However, there can be no assurances that these restrictions will prevent an ownership change from occurring in the future.\nOur use of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may become limited due to changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax law and other laws and regulations.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized. Changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances.\nThe U.S. Congress and the presidential administration have indicated an interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income tax code. Possible approaches include lowering the 35 percent corporate tax rate, modifying the taxation of income earned outside the U.S. and limiting or eliminating various other deductions, tax credits and/or other tax preferences. It is not possible at this time to quantify either the one-time impacts from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities that might result upon tax reform enactment or the ongoing impacts reform proposals might have on income tax expense.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $232 million in long-term net deferred tax assets which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. A change in the tax laws could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion regarding whether to take a valuation allowance against these and other tax assets and, if so, how much.\nAs a result of the consummation of the acquisition of TASC, we may not be able to participate in a potential consolidation in our industry for several years.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in that section, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may become subject to significant limitations. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to be acquired or to engage in strategic acquisitions because such transactions could result in a limitation on the utilization of our NOLs and other tax attributes. For example, our ability to use equity as consideration in a strategic transaction may be limited because such an equity issuance could result in an ownership change. If an ownership change were to occur, our ability to use any NOLs and certain other tax attributes existing at that time could be significantly limited.\nThere is intense competition for contracts in our industry and awards are frequently protested by unsuccessful bidders. Thus, we may not be able to win competitively awarded contracts and, when we win, such awards may still be delayed or canceled. Increased competition may reduce our revenue and require us to accept lower profit margins on our awarded contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts at our historic levels. The markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive and our government contracts are usually subject to competitive bidding. We expect increased competition because of the uncertainty of future U.S. defense and government service budgets. Furthermore, the current competitive environment has resulted in an increase of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders, which typically extends the time until work on a contract can begin and, in some cases, can result in cancellation of the protested contract award. Additionally, some of our competitors are larger than we are and have more financial and other resources than we have. In addition, the revenue and profit margins on our awarded contracts may not be sufficient to maintain our current levels of profitability. We are also subject to risks associated with the substantial time, effort and experience required to prepare bids and proposals for competitively awarded contracts that may not be awarded to us.\nWe believe the principal points of competition in our markets are performance, price, reliability and responsiveness, domain knowledge, and reputation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in marketing, customer service and support. We may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing services or may adapt more quickly than we do to evolving customer requirements.\nAdditionally, increased competition could increase pricing pressures resulting in margin decline to stay competitive. Failure to continue competing successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur focus on becoming a leading provider of innovative and integrated services to the U.S. government requires us to more selectively pursue larger opportunities where we have a distinct competitive advantage and can offer best value. This redefined focus for our business entails risks, as some of the competitors for these opportunities may have greater resources and/or stronger customer relationships than we do.\nOver the past few years, we redefined our business model to focus on best value rather than low cost. In addition, our acquisitions of TASC and DRC significantly increased the overall scale of our business, which requires us to pursue larger opportunities in order to maintain and grow our share of the government services market. While we are confident that this strategy is the right one for our business, it entails risks, as the competitors for these larger opportunities may have greater resources and/or stronger relationships with the target customers. A best value strategy also requires us to offer technical solutions that distinguish us from our competitors, which can be challenging in proposals where our competitors have longer standing customer relationships than we do. If we are unable to successfully evolve our processes to effectively compete for these opportunities, we may not be able to win sufficient new contracts in order to sustain our business. This in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and future cash flows.\nThe U.S. government may prefer minority-owned, small and small disadvantaged businesses; therefore, in certain areas of our business, we may have fewer opportunities to bid for or could lose a portion of our existing work to small businesses.\nAs a result of the Small Business Administration set-aside program, the U.S. government may decide to restrict certain procurements only to bidders that qualify as minority-owned, small, or small disadvantaged businesses. In such cases, we would not be eligible to perform as a prime contractor on those programs and would be restricted to a maximum of 49% of the work as a subcontractor on those programs. Small business set asides are becoming increasingly common in our industry, and in particular in our federal civilian, Department of Defense and intelligence markets. An increase in the amount of procurements under the Small Business Administration set-aside program may impact our ability to bid on new procurements as a prime contractor or restrict our ability to re-compete on incumbent work that is placed in the set-aside program.\nOur IDIQ contracts are not firm orders for services, and we may generate limited or no revenue from these contracts which could adversely affect our operating performance.\nRevenue from IDIQ contracts was 50% of our revenue in 2016. IDIQ contracts are often awarded to multiple contractors and the award of an IDIQ contract does not represent a firm order for services. Generally, under an IDIQ contract, the government is not obligated to order a minimum of services or supplies from its contractor, irrespective of the total estimated contract value. Furthermore, following an award under a multi-award IDIQ program, the customer develops requirements for task orders that are competitively bid against all of the contract awardees. However, many contracts also permit the U.S. government to direct work to a specific contractor. Notwithstanding our cost reduction measures and strategic realignment, we may not win new task orders under these contracts for various reasons, including price, past performance and responsiveness, among others, which would have an adverse effect on our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and loss of revenue. There can be no assurance that our existing IDIQ contracts will result in actual revenue during any particular period or at all.\nOur government contracts contain unfavorable termination and suspension provisions and are subject to audit and modification. If a termination or suspension right is exercised by the government, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompanies engaged primarily in supplying defense-related services to U.S. government agencies are subject to certain industry specific risks including the ability of the U.S. government to unilaterally:\n\u2022terminate existing contracts;\n\u2022reduce the value of existing contracts;\n\u2022audit our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022control and potentially prohibit the export of our services and associated products; and\n\u2022suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations.\nAll of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract. Termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. Termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source and could damage our reputation, and impair our ability to compete for future contracts. Our contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.\nU.S. government agencies, including the DCAA and various agency Inspectors General, routinely audit and investigate our costs and performance on contracts, as well as our accounting, business systems and general business practices. Based on the results of such audits, the U.S. government may reduce our contract related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs. In addition, under U.S. government purchasing regulations, some of our costs, including certain business acquisition costs, certain legal costs, most financing costs, and certain marketing expenses may not be reimbursable under U.S. government contracts.\nOur results of operations and cash flows are substantially affected by our mix of cost-plus, time-and-material and fixed-price type contracts.\nOur revenue is transacted using written revenue arrangements, or contracts, which are generally cost-plus, time-and-material, or fixed-price. For a description of our revenue recognition policies, see Note 1 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn a cost-plus type contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract\u2019s fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels determined by our customers. Cost-plus type contracts with award fee provisions are our primary variable contract fee arrangement. Award fees provide for a fee based on actual performance relative to contractually specified performance criteria.\nOn a time-and-material type contract, we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (that include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost.\nOn a fixed-price type service contract, we agree to perform the contractual statement of work for a predetermined sales price. Although a fixed-price type contract generally permits us to retain profits if the total actual contract costs are less than the estimated contract costs, we bear the risk that increased costs may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain losses on the contract. This may result in greater risk to our business than under a cost-plus type and time-and-material type contracts where we generally do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key management and personnel, we may become unable to operate our business effectively.\nOur future success is dependent upon the continued contributions of our management, and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical personnel, including employees who have U.S. government security clearances, particularly clearances of top-secret and above. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies for members of our management. We face competition for management and technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Failure to attract and retain such personnel would damage our future prospects.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent significant assets on our balance sheet and we may experience further impairments.\nGoodwill remains the largest asset on our balance sheet, with an aggregate balance of $1,079 million and $1,093 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Since the time of the Spin-Off, we have recorded three impairments to goodwill. In connection with the preparation of our third quarter 2012 financial statements, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $426 million following an interim test of our goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a $292 million goodwill impairment related primarily due to the continued impact from legacy contracts that are ending, reduced in-theater work, new business that did not materialize in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a corresponding reduction in estimated future cash flows. Finally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a $10 million goodwill impairment as a result of our decision to divest our international development business. While these charges had no impact on our business operations, cash balances or operating cash flows, they resulted in significant losses during the reporting periods.\nIf we experience additional impairments in our goodwill, or if our other intangible assets become impaired, then we will be required to take further non-cash charges against earnings. Since goodwill impairment calculations are based on estimates, including external factors that are outside of our control such as our stock price and future market and economic conditions, it is possible that we may need to take additional goodwill impairment charges in the future. Goodwill may be further impaired if the estimated fair value of the reporting units goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. We also perform an analysis of our intangible assets to test for impairment whenever events occur that indicate impairment could exist. Examples of such events are: significant adverse changes in the intangible asset\u2019s market value, useful life, or in the business climate that could affect its value; a current-period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the intangible asset; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, the intangible asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. For additional discussion of our goodwill impairments in 2016 and 2015, see Note 5 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe previously have disclosed material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence in our financial reporting or have other material effects on our business and operations.\nIn connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015 as a result of a material weakness. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to properly evaluate the income tax benefit in\ninterim periods with losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, as previously reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 6, 2015, management concluded two other material weaknesses existed as of September 30, 2015: (1) we did not design and maintain effective controls over the evaluation of the retention rate assumption used to value acquired contractual customer relationship intangible assets (specifically, we did not design and maintain controls to evaluate the reliability of information used to assess the reasonableness of the retention rate assumption), and (2) we did not design and maintain effective controls to properly evaluate our identifiable finite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level and the appropriateness of the remaining useful lives in accordance with GAAP.\nWhile each of the material weaknesses discussed above has been remediated, we cannot be certain that, in the future, additional material weaknesses or deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. If our efforts to address the remaining material weakness identified above are not successful, or if an additional material weakness or deficiency occurs, such weakness or deficiency could result in misstatements in our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in the price of our common stock and stockholder confidence or other material effects on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement regulations and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a U.S. government audit or investigation.\nU.S. government contractors must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other requirements. These regulations and requirements, although customary in government contracts, increase our costs of compliance and, commensurately, the cost of performance. If any such regulations or procurement requirements change, our costs of complying with them could increase and reduce our margins.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies such as the DCAA and Defense Contract Management Agency. These agencies review our performance under our contracts, our cost structure, our incurred costs and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to incurred cost audits, our accounting systems, purchasing systems, billing systems, property management and control systems, cost estimating systems, compensation systems and management information systems. Any costs found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension, or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems business systems subject to its review to be inadequate or if it believes it is in the government\u2019s best interests during the pendency of a dispute. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nEffective January 1, 2013, we implemented a strategic realignment that included material changes in our cost structure. Changes in cost accounting practices are subject to a required procedure for determining the cost impact of any accounting changes. The Federal government is generally protected from paying increased costs resulting from a contractor\u2019s accounting changes. Were the government to require further changes to our cost structure, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we are also subject to U.S. government investigations relating to our operations, and we are subject to or expected to perform in compliance with a vast array of Federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Truth in Negotiations Act, the False Claims Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, Cost Accounting Standards, the ITAR promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act and the FCPA. We are also subject to Executive Orders issued by the presidential administration, including Executive Order 13706 (paid sick leave) and Executive Order 13673 (Fair Pay and Safe Workplace). An indictment of the Company by a Federal grand jury, or an administrative finding against us as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, could result in us being suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges. In addition, a conviction, or an administrative finding against us that rises to the requisite level of seriousness, could result in debarment from contracting with the U.S. government for a specific term and could result in civil and/or criminal sanctions, as well as reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties and fines, compensatory or treble damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We are also limited in our ability to provide information about our classified programs, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to these programs. Classified programs are subject to security restrictions and preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business.\nMisconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents and business partners could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation.\nMisconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws, including the U.S. Anti-Kickback Act and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and comparable foreign laws and regulations. Other examples could include the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal, state or local government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health or safety matters, bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations. Any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us, loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct, and as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business, reputation and our future results.\nPension funding and costs are dependent upon several economic assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly.\nAs a result of the acquisition of DRC, which closed on January 31, 2014, we assumed the obligations under DRC\u2019s then existing defined benefit pension plan (the Pension Plan). The impact of the Pension Plan on our GAAP earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for the Pension Plan may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, rates of return on plan assets, and other actuarial assumptions including participant mortality estimates. Changes in these factors also affect our plan funding, cash flow, and stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, the funding of the Pension Plan may be subject to changes caused by legislative or regulatory actions.\nWe will make contributions to fund the Pension Plan when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. The macro-economic factors discussed above, including the return on assets and the minimum funding requirements established by government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. A significant decline in the fair value of the assets in the Pension Plan, or other adverse changes to the Pension Plan could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.\nAs a result of the acquisition of TASC, we assumed the obligations under TASC\u2019s then existing defined benefit plan. This unfunded plan offered two retirement programs, a Cash Bonus Plan which terminated effective December 31, 2015 and a Retiree Health Reimbursement Account plan (RHRA). The impact of TASC\u2019s defined benefit plan on our U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for the plan may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to several key economic assumptions including interest rates and actuarial assumptions related to participant mortality, retirement and termination.\nU.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards govern the extent to which postretirement costs and plan contributions are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. government. On December 27, 2011 the U.S. Government\u2019s Cost Accounting Standards Board published a final rule that harmonizes Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) pension cost reimbursement rules with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) funding requirements. The rule is expected to eventually mitigate the mismatch between CAS costs and PPA-amended Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) minimum funding requirements, and result in an acceleration of allowable CAS pension costs as compared to the prior rules. We anticipate that government contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional CAS contract costs resulting from the final rule. As a result, we have sought and expect to continue to seek reimbursement from the U.S. government for a portion of our postretirement costs and plan contributions. For additional information related to our pension funding and costs, see Note 10 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are subject to the risks of current and future legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.\nWe are subject to potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings as well as various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in foreign countries and in the United States, any violations of which could potentially create a substantial liability for us, and also could cause harm to our reputation. Changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other government policies, the nature, timing, and effect of which are uncertain, may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses. We may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate or can estimate. Additionally, we may receive fines or penalties if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws, regulations or orders applicable to our business.\nMisconduct, fraud or other improper activities by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could also have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with Federal, state or local government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities, and any other applicable laws or regulations.\nMisconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer\u2019s sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. Other examples of potential misconduct include falsifying time or other records and violations of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Act. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with Federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business, our reputation and our future results.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies, these policies may not be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to current or future claims and may not cover the conduct that is the subject of the litigation. Desired levels of insurance may not be available in the future at economical prices or at all. In addition, we believe that while we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us, the results of litigation can be difficult to predict, including those involving jury trials. Accordingly, our current judgment as to the likelihood of our loss (or our current estimate as to the potential range of loss, if applicable) with respect to any particular litigation matter may turn out to be wrong. A significant judgment against us, arising out of any of our current or future legal proceedings and litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.\nAlthough approximately 99% of our revenues come from the U.S. government, a material amount of our work on behalf of the U.S. government is conducted internationally.\nOur business operations are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in or interpretations of laws or policies that may adversely affect the performance of our services;\n\u2022\nPolitical instability in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nImposition of inconsistent laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nReliance on the U.S. and other governments to authorize us to export products, technology and services to customers and other business partners;\n\u2022\nConducting business in places where laws, business practices and customs are unfamiliar or unknown; and\n\u2022\nImposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures.\nIn addition, our U.S. and foreign operations are subject to the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Our continued expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAny violation related to the foregoing or to other laws that govern our international business, such as U.S. economic sanctions or U.S. anti-boycott regulations, could result in substantial fines, disgorgement, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, debarment, and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Although such risks have not significantly impacted our business to date, we do not know the impact that these regulatory, geopolitical and other factors could have on our business in the future.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security attacks, and other disruptions.\nAs a U.S. defense contractor, we face a number of significant potential security threats, including cyber security attacks to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent disruptions in mission critical systems, the unauthorized access to or release of confidential information and corruption of data. Accordingly, any significant operational delays, or any destruction, unauthorized access to, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could adversely affect our financial results and damage the reputation for our services.\nWe have entered into a stockholders agreement with Birch, certain investment funds affiliated with KKR and certain investment funds affiliated with GA, which provides them with certain rights over company matters.\nAt the closing of the acquisition of TASC, we entered into a stockholders agreement with Birch, certain investment funds affiliated with KKR and certain investment funds affiliated with GA. The stockholders agreement establishes certain rights, restrictions and obligations of Birch Partners, certain investment funds affiliated with KKR and certain investment funds affiliated with GA, and sets forth other arrangements relating to us, including the right of Birch Partners to designate up to four directors for nomination to our board of directors and the right of its designees to participate on board committees, subject to KKR and GA maintaining certain beneficial ownership of our common stock. The interests of the parties to the stockholders agreement may differ from those of other holders of our common stock.\nWe may be responsible for U.S. Federal income tax liabilities that relate to the distribution.\nL-3 received an IRS Ruling stating that L-3 and its shareholders will not recognize any taxable income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of the Spin-Off, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. In addition, the Spin-Off was conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of tax counsel as to the satisfaction of certain requirements necessary for the Spin-Off to receive tax-free treatment upon which the IRS will not rule.\nWhile generally binding upon the IRS, the IRS Ruling is based on certain factual statements and representations. If any such factual statements or representations are incomplete or untrue in any material respect, or if the facts on which the IRS Ruling is based are materially different from the facts at the time of the Spin-Off, the IRS could modify or revoke the IRS Ruling retroactively.\nAs discussed above, certain requirements for tax-free treatment that were not covered in the IRS Ruling are addressed in the opinion of tax counsel. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the Spin-Off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. Like the IRS Ruling, the opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter tax counsel\u2019s conclusions.\nAt the time of the Spin-Off, L-3 was not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any such factual statements or representations in the IRS Ruling or the opinion of tax counsel to be incomplete or untrue or cause the facts on which the IRS Ruling is based, or the opinion will be based, to be materially different from the facts at the time of the Spin-Off. Notwithstanding the receipt of the IRS ruling and the opinion of tax counsel, if the IRS were to determine the Spin-Off to be taxable, L-3 would recognize a substantial tax liability.\nEven if the Spin-Off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the distribution would be taxable to L-3 (but not to L-3 shareholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of the stock of either us or L-3, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of the then-outstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The resulting tax liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have agreed not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the Spin-Off to be taxable to L-3, including under Section 355(e). Pursuant to a Tax Matters Agreement with L-3, we also agreed to indemnify L-3 for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions, and L-3 agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions entered into by L-3. In addition, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the L-3 consolidated group at the time of the Spin-Off (including us and our subsidiaries) would be severally liable for the resulting U.S. Federal income tax liability if all or a portion of the Spin-Off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nYou face the following risks in connection with ownership of our common stock:\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in DoD budget levels and procurement priorities;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nwins and losses on contract re-competitions and new business pursuits;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or earnings guidance, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe number of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and the defense industry, including changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. government defense budget;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nthe availability of government funding and changes in customer requirements for our products and services;\n\u2022\nnatural or environmental disasters that investors believe may affect us;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the budget of Federal, state and local governmental entities around the world;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, and restrictions on our charter related to our acquisition of TASC, could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, among other things, provide for a classified board and require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and certain provisions restricting the transferability of our common stock (as described below). These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and sales or other dispositions of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation with or to an interested shareholder.\nIn connection with the TASC acquisition, we also incorporated certain transfer restrictions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that could have potential anti-takeover effects. If a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d within the meaning of section 382 of the Code, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as its adjusted tax basis in its amortizable goodwill, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In order to reduce the likelihood that future transactions in Engility\u2019s securities will result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code, the Company\u2019s amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions that apply to acquisitions and dispositions by direct and indirect holders of (or persons who would become direct or indirect holders of) 4.9% or more of New Engility common stock or certain other interests in New Engility that are treated as stock for tax purposes.\nWe do not plan to pay regular dividends on our common stock and our outstanding debt could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nCurrently, we do not plan to pay a regular dividend on our common stock. The declaration of any future cash dividends and the amount of any such dividends, if declared, will be subject to our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, financial covenants and other contractual restrictions and to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Additionally, our credit agreement places significant restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Our Board of Directors may take into account such matters as general business conditions, industry practice, our financial condition and performance, our future prospects, our cash needs and capital investment plans, income tax consequences applicable law and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence the payment of dividends.", "PERMNO": 13502, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "EGL"}
