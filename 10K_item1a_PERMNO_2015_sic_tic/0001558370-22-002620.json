Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the following material risks could harm our business and future results of operations and could result in the trading price of our common stock declining and a partial or complete loss of your investment. These risks are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations and trading price of our common stock. The discussion contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A\nof the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, that involve risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nA. MARKET RISKS\nOur products and performance depend largely on the availability of hydrogen gas and an insufficient supply of hydrogen could negatively affect our sales and deployment of our products and services.\nOur products and services depend largely on the availability of hydrogen gas. We are dependent upon hydrogen suppliers for success with the profitable commercialization of our products and services. If these fuels are not readily available or if their prices are such that energy produced by our products costs more than energy provided by other sources, then our products could be less attractive to potential users and our products\u2019 value proposition could be negatively affected. If hydrogen suppliers elect not to participate in the material handling market, there may be an insufficient supply of hydrogen for this market that could negatively affect our sales and deployment of our products and services.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute and operate our green hydrogen production projects and such projects may cost more and take longer to complete than we expect.\nAs part of our vertical integration strategy, the Company is developing and constructing green hydrogen production facilities at locations across the United States and Canada. Our ability to successfully complete and operate these projects is not guaranteed. These projects will impact our ability to meet and supplement the hydrogen demands for our products and services, for both existing and prospective customers. Our hydrogen production projects are dependent, in part, upon the Company\u2019s ability to meet our internal demand for electrolyzers required for such projects. Electrolyzer demand by external customers may concurrently affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet the internal electrolyzer demand from our hydrogen production projects. The timing and cost to complete the construction of our hydrogen production projects are subject to a number of factors outside of our control and such projects may take longer and cost more to complete and become operational than we expect.\nFurthermore, the viability and competitiveness of our green hydrogen production facilities will depend, in part, upon favorable laws, regulations, and policies related to hydrogen production. Some of these laws, regulations, policies are nascent, and there is no guarantee that they will be favorable to our projects. Additionally, our facilities will be subject to numerous and new permitting, regulations, laws, and policies, many of which might vary by jurisdiction. Hydrogen production facilities are also subject to robust competition from well-established multi-national companies in the energy industry. There is no guarantee that our hydrogen production strategy will be successful, amidst this competitive environment.\nWe will continue to be dependent on certain third-party key suppliers for components in our products. The failure of a supplier to develop and supply components in a timely manner or at all, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our cost of production.\nWe rely on certain key suppliers for critical components in our products, and there are numerous other components for our products that are sole sourced. If we fail to maintain our relationships with our suppliers or build relationships with new suppliers, or if suppliers are unable to meet our demand, we may be unable to manufacture our products, or our products may be available only at a higher cost or after a delay. In addition, to the extent that our supply partners use technology or manufacturing processes that are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative sources. Furthermore, we may become increasingly subject to domestic content sourcing requirements and Buy America preferences, as required under certain United States federal infrastructure funding sources. Domestic content preferences and Buy America requirements potential mandate that our Company source certain components and materials from within the United States. Conformity with these provisions potentially depends upon our ability to increasingly source components or certain materials from within the United States. An inability to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully compete for certain projects or awards utilizing federal funds subject to such mandates.\nThe failure of a supplier to develop and supply components in a timely manner or at all, or to develop or supply components that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements, or our inability to obtain substitute sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could\nincrease our cost of production. If we cannot obtain substitute materials or components on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we could be prevented from delivering our products to our customers within required timeframes. Any such delays could result in sales and installation delays, cancellations, penalty payments or loss of revenue and market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe depend on a concentration of anchor customers for the majority of our revenues and the loss of any of these customers would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe sell most of our products to a range of customers that include a few anchor customers, and while we are continually seeking to expand our customer base, we expect this will continue for the next several years. Total revenue in 2021 for Amazon was $205.1 million, which included a provision for warrant charges of $0.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this customer accounted for 40.8% of our total consolidated revenues. Additionally, 34.8% of our total consolidated revenues in 2020 were associated primarily with two other customers.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company waived the vesting conditions under the Amazon Warrant, which resulted in a reduction in revenue of $399.7 million, resulting in negative consolidated revenue of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 18, \u201cWarrant Transaction Agreements\u201d to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Total revenue in 2020 for Amazon customer was negative $310.1 million, and this customer accounted for (332.4)% of our total consolidated revenues which included a provision for warrant charge of $420.0 million, which was recorded as a reduction of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 49.7% of our total consolidated revenues were associated primarily with two customers. Any decline in business with significant customers could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success is dependent upon the continued purchases of our products by a small number of customers. If we are unable to broaden our customer base and expand relationships with potential customers, our business will continue to be impacted by demand fluctuations due to our dependence on a small number of customers. Demand fluctuations can have a negative impact on our revenues, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our dependence on a small number of major customers exposes us to additional risks. A slowdown, delay or reduction in a customer\u2019s orders could result in excess inventories or unexpected quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and liquidity. Each of our major customers has significant purchasing leverage over us to require changes in sales terms including pricing, payment terms and product delivery schedules, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2021, one customer comprised approximately 46.6% of the total accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2020, two customers comprised approximately 62.6% of the total accounts receivable balance. If one of our major customers delays payment of or is unable to pay their receivables, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nVolatility in commodity prices and product shortages may adversely affect our gross margins.\nSome of our products contain commodity-priced materials. Commodity prices and supply levels affect our costs. For example, platinum and iridium are key materials in our PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers. Both platinum and iridium are scarce natural resources, and we are dependent upon a sufficient supply of these commodities. These resources may become increasingly difficult to source due to various cost, geopolitical, or other reasons, which in turn might have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny shortages could adversely affect our ability to produce commercially viable fuel cell systems, electrolyzers, or hydrogen production facilities, and in turn, significantly raise our cost of producing our products and services. While we do not anticipate significant near- or long-term shortages in the supply of platinum or iridium, a shortage could adversely affect our ability to produce commercially viable PEM fuel cells electrolyzers, or raise our cost of producing such products. Global inflationary pressures have increased in 2021, which could potentially increase commodity price volatility. Our ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions, and the inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins.\nOur ability to source parts and raw materials from our suppliers could be disrupted or delayed in our supply chain which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations require significant amounts of necessary parts and raw materials. We deploy a continuous, companywide process to source our parts and raw materials from fewer suppliers, and to obtain parts from suppliers in\nlow-cost countries where possible. If we are unable to source these parts or raw materials, our operations may be disrupted, or we could experience a delay or halt in certain of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, reduced availability or interruption in supplies, whether resulting from more stringent regulatory requirements, supplier financial condition, increases in duties and tariff costs, disruptions in transportation, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, severe weather, or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the Company has experienced supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to suppliers utilizing force majeure provisions under existing contracts. Furthermore, the ongoing global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant challenges for global supply chains resulting in inflationary cost pressures, component shortages, and transportation delays. We expect that these challenges could continue to have an impact on our businesses for the foreseeable future.\nWeakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of our customers could negatively impact our sales growth and results of operations.\nThe demand for our products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of our customers. Many of our customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, central bank interest rate changes, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond our control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services. We have from time-to-time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. Labor shortages have become more pronounced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, labor shortages might affect our ability to attain qualified candidates for certain positions within the Company. Furthermore, recent domestic inflationary trends have become increasingly relevant and might have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face risks associated with our plans to market, distribute and service our products and services internationally.\nWe have begun to market, distribute, sell and service our product offerings internationally and expect to continue investing in our international operations. We have limited experience operating internationally, including developing and manufacturing our products to comply with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets. Our success in international markets will depend, in part, on our ability and that of our partners to secure relationships with foreign sub-distributors, and our ability to manufacture products that meet foreign regulatory and commercial requirements. Additionally, our planned international operations are subject to other inherent risks, including potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights in foreign countries, and could be adversely affected due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political and economic instability, acts or threats of terrorism, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, fund transfer restrictions, capital controls, exchange rate controls, taxes, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, changes in legislation or regulations and other additional developments or restrictive actions over which we will have no control.\nDoing business in foreign markets requires us to be able to respond to rapid changes in market, legal, and political conditions in these countries. As we expand in international markets, including but not limited to joint ventures involving potential business activities in Australia, South Korea, India, Vietnam, and elsewhere, we may face numerous challenges. Such challenges might include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; potential conflicts or disputes that countries may have to deal with; required compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the UK Anti-Bribery Act of 2010; data privacy requirements; labor laws and anti-competition regulations; export or import restrictions; laws and business practices favoring local companies; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivables; difficulties in managing international operations; potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international laws. Any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The success of our international expansion will depend, in part, on our ability to succeed in navigating the different legal, regulatory, economic, social, and political environments. For example, in June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved a reference to withdraw the United Kingdom\u2019s membership from the European Union, which is commonly known as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020, but the United Kingdom remained in the European Union\u2019s customs union and\nsingle market for a transition period that expired on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was ratified and took full effect on May 1, 2021. While the economic integration does not reach the level that existed during the time the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement sets out preferential arrangements in areas such as trade in goods and in services, digital trade and intellectual property. Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are expected to continue in relation to the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in certain other areas which are not covered by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The long term effects of Brexit will depend on the effects of the implementation and application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and any other relevant agreements between the United Kingdom and the European Union. We cannot predict the effect of Brexit nor do we have control over whether and to which effect any other member state will decide to exit the European Union in the future. These developments, as well as potential crises and forms of political instability arising therefrom or any other as of yet unforeseen development, may harm our business.\nOur investments in joint ventures may involve numerous risks that may affect the ability of such joint ventures to make distributions to us.\nWe currently conduct some of our operations through joint ventures, with such partners including SK E&S, Renault, Acciona, and FFI, in which we share control with our joint venture participants. Our joint venture participants may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, or those of the joint venture. Furthermore, our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with such joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations. In addition, should any of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the joint venture to make future distributions to us.\nOur products and services face intense competition.\nThe markets for energy products, including PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, and hydrogen production are intensely competitive. Our recent expansion into electrolyzer manufacturing and hydrogen production similarly faces robust competition - both from incumbent companies and new emerging business interests. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are and may have the manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities to complete research, development, and commercialization of profitable, commercially viable products more quickly and effectively than we can. There are many companies engaged in all areas of traditional and alternative energy generation in the United States and abroad, including, among others, major electric, oil, chemical, natural gas, battery, generator and specialized electronics firms, as well as universities, research institutions and foreign government-sponsored companies. These firms are engaged in forms of power generation such as advanced battery technologies, generator sets, fast charged technologies and other types of fuel cell technologies. Well established companies might similarly seek to expand into new types of energy products, including PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, or hydrogen production. Additionally, some competitors may rely other different competing technologies for fuel cells, electrolyzers, or hydrogen production. We believe our technologies have many advantages. In the near future, we expect the demand for these products - electrolyzers in particular - to largely offset any hypothetical market preference for competing technologies. However, changes in customer preferences, the marketplace, or government policies could be favor competing technologies. The primary current value proposition for our fuel cell customers stems from productivity gains in using our solutions. Longer term, given evolving market dynamics and changes in alternative energy tax credits, if we are unable to successfully develop future products that are competitive with competing technologies in terms of price, reliability and longevity, customers may not buy our products. Technological advances in alternative energy products, battery systems or other fuel cell, electrolyzer, or hydrogen technologies may make our products less attractive or render them obsolete.\nB. FINANCIAL AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\nIf we cannot obtain financing to support the sale of our products and service to our customers or our power purchase agreements with customers, such failure may adversely affect our liquidity and financial position.\nCustomers representing most of our revenue access our products through Power Purchase Agreements (\u201cPPAs\u201d), rather than a direct purchase. These PPA arrangements require us to finance the purchase of such products, either ourselves or through third-party financing sources. To date, we have been successful in obtaining or providing the necessary financing arrangements. There is no certainty, however, that we will be able to continue to obtain or provide adequate\nfinancing for these arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. Failure to obtain or provide such financing may result in the loss of material customers and product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, if we are required to continue to pledge or restrict substantial amounts of our cash to support these financing arrangements, such cash will not be available to us for other purposes, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position. For example, as of December 31, 2021, approximately $561.1 million of our cash is restricted to support such leasing arrangements, comprised of cash depsosits and collateralizing letters of credit, which prevents us from using such cash for other purposes.\nWe may require additional capital funding and such capital may not be available to us.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion, restricted cash of $650.9 million and net working capital of $4.0 billion (which is comprised of the net amount of current assets of $4.4 billion and current liabilities of $420.6 million). This compares to $1.3 billion, $321.9 million, and $1.4 billion, of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and net working capital (which is comprised of the net amount of current assets of $1.6 billion and current liabilities of $222.4 million), respectively, on December 31, 2020.\nOur cash requirements relate primarily to working capital needed to operate and grow our business, including funding operating expenses, growth in inventory to support both shipments of new units and servicing the installed base, growth in equipment leased and equipment related to PPAs for customers under long-term arrangements, funding the growth in our GenKey \u201cturn-key\u201d solution, which includes the installation of our customers\u2019 hydrogen infrastructure as well as delivery of the hydrogen fuel, continued expansion of our markets, such as Europe and Asia, continued development and expansion of our products, such as ProGen, payment of lease obligations under sale/leaseback financings, mergers and acquisitions, strategic investments and joint ventures, liquid hydrogen plant construction, expanding production facilities and the repayment or refinancing of our long-term debt. Our ability to meet future liquidity needs and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the timing and quantity of product orders and shipments; attaining and expanding positive gross margins across all product lines; the timing and amount of our operating expenses; the timing and costs of working capital needs; the timing and costs of building a sales base; the ability of our customers to obtain financing to support commercial transactions; our ability to obtain financing arrangements to support the sale or leasing of our products and services to customers, including financing arrangements to repay or refinance our long-term debt, and the terms of such agreements that may require us to pledge or restrict substantial amounts of our cash to support these financing arrangements; the timing and costs of developing marketing and distribution channels; the timing and costs of product service requirements; the timing and costs of hiring and training product staff; the extent to which our products gain market acceptance; the timing and costs of product development and introductions; the extent of our ongoing and new research and development programs; and changes in our strategy or our planned activities. If we are unable to fund our operations with positive cash flows and cannot obtain external financing, we may not be able to sustain future operations. As a result, we may be required to delay, reduce and/or cease our operations and/or seek bankruptcy protection.\nWe cannot assure you that any necessary additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. We believe that it could be difficult to raise additional funds and there can be no assurance as to the availability of additional financing or the terms upon which additional financing may be available. Additionally, even if we raise sufficient capital through additional equity or debt financings, strategic alternatives or otherwise, there can be no assurance that the revenue or capital infusion will be sufficient to enable us to develop our business to a level where it will be profitable or generate positive cash flow. If we incur additional debt, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, thus limiting funds available for our business activities. The terms of any debt securities issued could also impose significant restrictions on our operations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance, and may adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and/or licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe have incurred losses and anticipate continuing to incur losses.\nWe have not achieved operating profitability in any quarter since our formation and we will continue to incur net losses until we can produce sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Our net losses attributable to common stockholders were approximately $460.0 million in 2021, $596.2 million in 2020, and $85.6 million in 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.4 billion. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until we can produce and\nsell our products and services on a large-scale and cost-effective basis. We cannot guarantee when we will operate profitably, if ever. In order to achieve profitability, we must successfully execute our planned path to profitability in the early adoption markets on which we are focused. The profitability of our products depends largely on material and manufacturing costs and the market price of hydrogen. The hydrogen infrastructure that is needed to support our growth readiness and cost efficiency must be available and cost efficient. We must continue to shorten the cycles in our product roadmap with respect to improvement in product reliability and performance that our customers expect. We must execute on successful introduction of our products into the market. We must accurately evaluate our markets for, and react to, competitive threats in both other technologies (such as advanced batteries) and our technology field. Finally, we must continue to lower our products\u2019 build costs and lifetime service costs. If we are unable to successfully take these steps, we may never operate profitably, and, even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business.\nAt December 31, 2021, our total outstanding indebtedness was approximately $574.4 million, consisting of $192.6 million of the $200.0 in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 1, 2025 (the \u201c3.75% Convertible Senior Notes\u201d), $128.0 million of long-term debt primarily associated with our Term Loan Facility with Generate Lending, LLC, or the Term Loan Facility, and other long-term debt, and $253.7 million of finance obligations consisting primarily of debt associated with sale of future revenues and sale/leaseback financings.\nOur indebtedness could have negative consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u25cf we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our outstanding debt;\n\u25cf we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u25cf we may need to use all, or a substantial portion, of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u25cf our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions could increase;\n\u25cf our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general could be limited;\n\u25cf our amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt; and\n\u25cf our failure to comply with the covenants in the agreement governing our Term Loan Facility which, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nOur indebtedness will require that we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, research and development and other general corporate or business activities. Our ability to generate cash to repay our indebtedness is subject to the performance of our business, as well as general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe agreement governing our Term Loan Facility contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing, because the agreement governing our Term Loan Facility contains covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt, create liens, make acquisitions, make loans, pay dividends, dissolve, or enter into leases and asset sale. In addition, the agreement requires that we comply with a collateral coverage covenant that was measured on December 31, 2019. Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our failure to comply with this covenant could result in a default under our other debt instruments, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. If any of our debt is\naccelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreement governing our Term Loan Facility, we cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with such covenants in the future. An event of default under the agreement governing our Term Loan Facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAn impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAn impairment of our long-lived assets or goodwill could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets on a quarterly basis to identify events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of certain assets may not be recoverable. The determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups. During 2021, the Company determined that the assets deployed for certain PPA arrangements, as well as certain assets related to the delivery of fuel to customers, were not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset group. However, the estimated fair value of the assets in these asset groups equaled or exceeded the carrying amount of the assets or otherwise limited the amount of impairment that would have been recognized. The Company has not recognized a provision for the expected future losses under these PPA arrangements as of December 31, 2021 but the Company expects that it will recognize future losses for these PPA arrangements as it continues its efforts to reduce costs of delivering the maintenance component of these arrangements. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value will be recorded. The projections of future cash flows used in these analyses require the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future.\nGoodwill is required to be qualitatively assessed at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances arise or can be quantitatively tested for impairment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had goodwill of $220.4 million. Goodwill is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. When the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded. This would result in incremental expenses for that period, which would reduce any earnings or increase any loss for the period in which the impairment was determined to have occurred. A decline in our stock price and market capitalization, declines in future cash flows, increases in cost pressures driven by inflation, supply chain issues and labor shortages, or the occurrence of another triggering event could, under certain circumstances, result in an impairment charge being recorded. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for its single reporting unit and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Our goodwill impairment analysis is sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which charge could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201c3.75 Convertible Senior Notes\u201d)) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the convertible senior notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible senior notes. As a result, we are required to record a non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the convertible senior notes to their face amount over the term of the convertible senior notes.\nAs a result, we report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include the amortization of the debt discount, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results or the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, on January 1, 2021, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) using the modified retrospective approach. Consequently, the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes is now accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. This accounting change removed the impact of recognizing the equity component of the Company\u2019s convertible notes at issuance and the subsequent accounting impact of additional interest expense from debt discount amortization. The cumulative effect of the accounting change upon adoption on January 1, 2021 increased the carrying amount of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes by $120.6 million, reduced accumulated deficit by $9.6 million and reduced additional paid-in capital by $130.2 million. Future interest expense of the convertible notes will be lower as a result of adoption of this guidance and net loss per share will be computed using the if-converted method for convertible instruments.\nThe convertible note hedges may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn conjunction with the pricing of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the \u201c3.75% Notes Capped Call\u201d) with certain counterparties at a price of $16.3 million. The 3.75% Notes Capped Call cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the aggregate number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that underlie the initial 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and is generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company\u2019s common stock upon any conversion of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The cap price of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call is initially $6.7560 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 60% over the last then-reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock of $4.11 per share on the date of the transaction and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the 3.75% Notes Capped Call. The 3.75% Notes Capped Call becomes exercisable if the conversion option is exercised.\nThe option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes or following any repurchase of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, if any such convertible note hedge transaction fails to become effective, the option counterparties may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and are subject to the risk that one or more of such option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes subject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR and transition to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate and could possibly adversely affect our financing costs.\nIn 2018, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By the end of 2021, it is expected that no new\ncontracts will reference LIBOR and will instead use SOFR. Due to the broad use of LIBOR as a reference rate, the impact of this transition on the interest rates charged to the Company could possibly adversely affect our financing costs.\nC. OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may not be able to expand our business or manage our future growth effectively.\nWe may not be able to expand our business or manage future growth. We plan to continue to improve our manufacturing processes and build additional manufacturing production over the next five years, which will require successful execution of:\n\u25cf expanding our existing customers and expanding to new markets\u037e\n\u25cf ensuring manufacture, delivery and installation of our products\u037e\n\u25cf implementing and improving additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls\u037e\n\u25cf integration of acquisitions;\n\u25cf hiring additional employees\u037e\n\u25cf expanding and upgrading our technological capabilities\u037e\n\u25cf managing relationships with our customers and suppliers and strategic partnerships with other third parties\u037e\n\u25cf maintaining adequate liquidity and financial resources\u037e and\n\u25cf continuing to increase our revenues from operations.\nEnsuring delivery of our products is subject to many market risks, including scarcity, significant price fluctuations and competition. Maintaining adequate liquidity is dependent upon a variety of factors, including continued revenues from operations, working capital improvements, and compliance with our debt instruments. We may not be able to achieve our growth strategy and increase production capacity as planned during the foreseeable future. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, develop new products, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures. For further information on risks associated with new business ventures, see Item I.3.E, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d (\u201cStrategic Risks - We may be unable to successfully pursue new business ventures.\u201d).\nDelays in or not completing our product development goals may adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nIf we experience delays in meeting our development goals, our products exhibit technical defects, or if we are unable to meet cost or performance goals, including power output, useful life and reliability, the profitable commercialization of our products will be delayed. In this event, potential purchasers of our products may choose alternative technologies and any delays could allow potential competitors to gain market advantages. We cannot assure that we will successfully meet our commercialization schedule in the future.\nPeriodically, we may enter into contracts with our customers for certain products that have not been developed or produced. There can be no assurance that we will complete the development of these products and meet the specifications required to fulfill customer agreements and deliver products on schedule. Pursuant to such agreements, the customers would have the right to provide notice to us if, in their good faith judgment, we have materially deviated from such agreements. Should a customer provide such notice, and we cannot mutually agree to a modification to the agreement, then the customer may have the right to terminate the agreement, which could have a material adverse effect upon our future business.\nOther than our current products, which we believe to be commercially viable at this time, we do not know when or whether we will successfully complete research and development of other commercially viable products that could be critical to our future. If we are unable to develop additional commercially viable products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. The profitable commercialization of our products depends on our ability to reduce the costs of our components and subsystems, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently reduce these costs. In addition, the profitable commercialization of our products requires achievement and verification of their overall reliability, efficiency and safety targets, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop, acquire or license the technology necessary to achieve these targets. We must complete additional research and development to fill our product portfolios and deliver enhanced functionality and reliability in order to manufacture additional commercially viable products in commercial quantities. In addition, while we continue to conduct tests to predict the overall life of our products,\nwe may not have run our products over their projected useful life prior to large-scale commercialization. As a result, we cannot be sure that our products will last as long as predicted, resulting in possible warranty claims and commercial failures.\nCertain component quality issues have resulted in adjustments to our warranty reserves and the accrual for loss contracts.\nIn the past, quality issues have arisen with respect to certain components in certain products that are currently being used at customer sites. Under the terms of our extended maintenance contracts, we have had to retrofit units subject to component quality issues with replacement components to improve the reliability of our products for our customers. We recorded a provision for loss contracts related to service in the current and prior years. Though we continue to work with our vendors on these component issues to improve quality and reliability, unanticipated additional quality issues or warranty claims may arise, and additional material charges may be incurred in the future. Quality issues also could cause profitable maintenance contracts to become unprofitable.\nIn addition, from time to time we experience other unexpected design, manufacturing or product performance issues. We make significant investment in the continued improvement of our products and maintain appropriate warranty reserves for known and unexpected issues; however, unknown malfunctions or defects could result in unexpected material liabilities and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and prospects. In addition, an actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of our products resulting in a decline in demand for our products and could divert the attention of our management, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nOur products use flammable fuels that are inherently dangerous substances.\nOur fuel cell systems use hydrogen gas in catalytic reactions. While our products do not use this fuel in a combustion process, hydrogen gas is a flammable fuel that could leak and combust if ignited by another source. Further, any such accidents involving our products or other products using similar flammable fuels could materially suppress demand for, or heighten regulatory scrutiny of, our products. Our expansion into electrolyzer manufacturing, hydrogen production, and the transport of hydrogen fuel similarly involve hydrogen in either gaseous or liquified form. Additionally, the production of hydrogen through electrolysis also results in the generation of oxygen. As a result, oxygen must be separated and controlled during the hydrogen production process. Such activities are subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with flammable gases.\nThe risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of fuel cell products, electrolyzers, hydrogen production and destruction, and in products fueled by hydrogen, a flammable gas. Any liability for damages resulting from malfunctions or design defects could be substantial and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, an actual or perceived problem with our products could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of our products resulting in a decline in demand for our products, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur purchase orders may not ship, be commissioned or installed, or convert to revenue.\nSome of the orders we accept from customers require certain conditions or contingencies to be satisfied, or may be cancelled, prior to shipment or prior to commissioning or installation, some of which are outside of our control. Historically, shipments made against these orders have generally occurred between 90 days and 24 months from the date of acceptance of the order. Orders for the Company\u2019s products and services approximated $682.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The time periods from receipt of an order to shipment date and installation vary widely and are determined by a number of factors, including the terms of the customer contract and the customer\u2019s deployment plan. There may also be product redesign or modification requirements that must be satisfied prior to shipment of units under certain of our agreements. If the redesigns or modifications are not completed, some or all of our orders may not ship or convert to revenue. In certain cases, we publicly disclose anticipated, pending orders with prospective customers; however, those prospective customers may require certain conditions or contingencies to be satisfied prior to entering into a purchase order with us, some of which are outside of our control. Such conditions or contingencies that may be required to be satisfied before we receive a purchase order may include, but are not limited to, successful product demonstrations or field trials. Converting orders into revenue is also dependent upon our customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing. Some conditions\nor contingencies that are out of our control may include, but are not limited to, government tax policy, government funding programs, and government incentive programs. Additionally, some conditions and contingencies may extend for several years. We may have to compensate customers, by either reimbursement, forfeiting portions of associated revenue, or other methods depending on the terms of the customer contract, based on the failure on any of these conditions or contingencies. While not probable, this could have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow.\nWe are dependent on information technology in our operations and the failure of such technology may adversely affect our business. Potential security breaches of our information technology systems, including cyber-attacks, could lead to liability or could damage our reputation and financial results.\nWe may experience problems with the operation of our current information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, as well as the development and deployment of new information technology systems, that could adversely affect, or even temporarily disrupt, all or a portion of our operations until resolved. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected cost savings. Any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws.\nInformation technology system and/or network disruptions could harm the Company\u2019s operations. Failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from security breaches, including cyber-attacks, could result in the misuse of company assets, unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential business information, disruption to the company, diversion of management resources, regulatory inquiries, legal claims or proceedings, reputational damage, loss of sales, reduction in value of our investment in research and development, among other costs to the company. We may experience attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems on which we maintain proprietary and confidential information. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks, or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and harder to detect and fight against. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to access our confidential information through other means, for example by fraudulently inducing our employees to disclose confidential information. We actively seek to prevent, detect and investigate any unauthorized access. These threats are also continually evolving, and as a result, might become increasingly difficult to detect. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased prevalence of employees working from home may exacerbate the aforementioned cybersecurity risks. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our information technology system could be penetrated by outside parties.\nOur future plans could be harmed if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel.\nWe have attracted a highly skilled management team and specialized workforce, including scientists, engineers, researchers, manufacturing, marketing and sales professionals. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel. We do not know whether we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel. Furthermore, our ability to attract and retain key employees could be adversely impacted if we do not have a sufficient number of shares available under our equity incentive plan to issue to our employees, or if our stockholders do not approve requested share increases or a new equity incentive. In general, our industry continues to experience change and be subject to significant competitive pressures with respect to the retention of top talent. The loss of key employees may occur due to perceived opportunity for promotion, compensation levels or composition of compensation, work environment or other individual reasons. In addition, we have from time-to-time experienced labor shortages and other labor-related issues. Labor shortages have become more pronounced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of factors might adversely affect the labor force available to us in one or more of our markets, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers\u2019 health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. These factors can also impact the cost of labor. An overall labor shortage or lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our inability to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis, or the departure of key employees, could materially and adversely affect our development and profitable commercialization plans and, therefore, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect important intellectual property and we could incur substantial costs defending against claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nPEM fuel cell technology was first developed in the 1950s, and fuel processing technology has been practiced on a large scale in the petrochemical industry for decades. Accordingly, we do not believe that we can establish a significant\nproprietary position in the fundamental component technologies in these areas. However, our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary system-level technologies, systems designs and manufacturing processes. We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other policies and procedures related to confidentiality to protect our intellectual property. However, some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application. Moreover, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will issue or, in the case of patents issued or to be issued, that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes. Even if all of our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad, our patents may be challenged or invalidated. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending patent infringement suits or otherwise protecting our intellectual property rights. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so. Moreover, patent applications filed in foreign countries may be subject to laws, rules and procedures that are substantially different from those of the United States, and any resulting foreign patents may be difficult and expensive to obtain and enforce. In addition, we do not know whether the USPTO will grant federal registrations based on our pending trademark applications. Even if federal registrations are granted to us, our trademark rights may be challenged. It is also possible that our competitors or others will adopt trademarks similar to ours, thus impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending trademark infringement suits.\nFurthermore, we might encounter difficulties protecting intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. Certain jurisdictions do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection. Enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and adverse impacts to our intellectual property rights.\nFurther, our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. If we are found to be infringing third party patents, we could be required to pay substantial royalties and/or damages, and we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use such patents on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development, manufacture or sale of our products, and could necessitate the expenditure of significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property.\nWe may need to pursue lawsuits or legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain names, and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If third parties prepare and file applications for trademarks used or registered by us, we may oppose those applications and be required to participate in proceedings to determine the priority of rights to the trademark. Similarly, competitors may have filed applications for patents, may have received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or technology that block or compete with ours. We may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine the priority of invention and the right to a patent for the technology. Litigation and interference proceedings, even if they are successful, are expensive to pursue and time consuming, and we could use a substantial amount of our management and financial resources in either case.\nConfidentiality agreements to which we are party may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors. Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and processes could allow our competitors to limit or eliminate any competitive advantages we may have.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that could harm our business.\nWe are currently, and in the future may continue to be, subject to commercial disputes and litigation. In connection with any disputes or litigation in which we are involved, we may incur costs and expenses in connection with defending ourselves or in connection with the payment of any settlement or judgment or compliance with any ruling in connection therewith. The expense of defending litigation may be significant. The amount of time to resolve lawsuits is unpredictable and defending ourselves may divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGAAP is subject to interpretation by the FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. See Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us. Further, the implementation of new accounting pronouncements or a change in other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our financial results.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below expectations of investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. For example, our revenue recognition, loss accrual for service contracts, goodwill and impairment of long-lived assets policies are complex, and we often must make estimates and assumptions that could prove to be incorrect. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, loss accrual for service contracts, goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and provision for common stock warrants. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we do not effectively remediate these material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nManagement identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the identified material weaknesses and our actions to date to remediate the material weaknesses. If we do not effectively remediate these material weaknesses or if we otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nD. REGULATORY RISKS\nThe reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative energy technologies, or the failure to renew such subsidies and incentives, could reduce demand for our products, lead to a reduction in our revenues and adversely impact our operating results and liquidity.\nWe believe that the near-term growth of alternative energy technologies is affected by the availability and size of government and economic incentives. Many of these government incentives expire, phase out over time, may exhaust the allocated funding, or require renewal by the applicable authority. In addition, these incentive programs could be reduced or discontinued for other reasons. The investment tax credit under the U.S. tax code was renewed in February 2018. The renewal allows for a 30% investment tax credit which declined to 26% for 2021 and 2022, and will decline to 22% in 2023 and zero for 2024 and later. Furthermore, changes or amendments to the investment tax credit might be more favorable to other technologies. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of the investment tax credit or other government subsidies and economic incentives, or the failure to renew such tax credit, governmental subsidies, or economic incentives, may result in the diminished economic competitiveness of our products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect the growth of alternative energy technologies, including our products, as well as our future operating results and liquidity.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local and non-US environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations that could impose significant costs and liabilities on us.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, transportation, disposal and human\nexposure to hazardous substances and wastes, product safety, emissions of pollution into the environment and human health and safety. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with these laws and regulations. Furthermore, federal, state, and local governments are increasingly regulating and restricting the use of certain chemicals, substances, and materials. Some of these policy initiative could foreseeably be impactful to our business. For example, laws, regulations, or other policy initiatives might address substances found within component parts to our products, in which event our Company would be required to comply with such requirements.\nViolation of these laws or regulations or the occurrence of an explosion or other accident in connection with our fuel cell systems at our properties or at third party locations could lead to substantial liabilities and sanctions, including fines and penalties, cleanup costs or the requirement to undertake corrective action. Further, environmental laws and regulations, and the administration, interpretation and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, certain environmental laws impose liability, which can be joint, several and strict, on current and previous owners and operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and damage to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. They can also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated, and such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. Our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTrade policies, treaties and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and components for our products, particularly electrical components common in the semiconductor industry. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes. The U.S. presidential administration and U.S. Congress are in the process of revisiting changes made by the prior U.S. presidential administration. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could have a material effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States.\nThis uncertainty includes: (i) the possibility of altering the existing tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the United States, including the U.S. government\u2019s 25% tariff on a range of products from China; (ii) the effects stemming from the removal of such previously imposed tariffs; (iii) subsequent tariffs imposed by the United States on any other U.S. trading partner such as Russia; and (iv) potential tariffs imposed by trading partners on U.S. goods. The institution of trade tariffs on items imported by us from other countries could increase our costs, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements or whether quotas, duties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions on our products will be changed or imposed. In addition, an open conflict or war across any region could affect our ability to obtain raw materials. The current military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and related sanctions, export controls or other actions that may be initiated by nations, including the United States, the European Union or Russia (e.g., potential cyberattacks, disruption of energy flows, etc.) could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain or our business partners or customers in other countries beyond Russia and Ukraine. Although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, if we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, regulatory changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and components could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices to obtain these raw materials or components from other sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nOur business may become subject to increased government regulation.\nOur products are subject to certain federal, state, local, and non-U.S. laws and regulations, including, for example, state and local ordinances relating to building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections, hydrogen transportation and siting and related matters. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Government Regulations\u201d for additional\ninformation. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Further, as products are introduced into the market commercially, governments may impose new regulations. We do not know the extent to which any such regulations may impact our ability to manufacture, distribute, install and service our products. Any regulation of our products, whether at the federal, state, local or foreign level, including any regulations relating to the production, operation, installation, and servicing of our products may increase our costs and the price of our products, and noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. A number of factors may adversely affect our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; the availability of loss or credit carryforwards to offset taxable income; changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof; or examinations by US federal, state or foreign jurisdictions that disagree with interpretations of tax rules and regulations in regard to positions taken on tax filings. A change in our effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely affect the carrying value of our tax assets and our future results from operations.\nIn addition, as our business grows, we are required to comply with increasingly complex taxation rules and practices. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and in foreign tax jurisdictions as we expand internationally. The development of our tax strategies requires additional expertise and may impact how we conduct our business. If our tax strategies are ineffective or we are not in compliance with domestic and international tax laws, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal NOL carryforwards of $905.6 million, which begin to expire in various amounts and at various dates in 2034 through 2037 (other than federal NOL carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017, which are not subject to expiration). As of December 31, 2021, we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $9.0 million, which begin to expire in 2033. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), changes in our ownership may limit the amount of our NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually to offset our future taxable income, if any. This limitation would generally apply in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50 percentage points within a three-year period. Based on studies of the changes in ownership of the Company, it has been determined that a Section 382 ownership change occurred in 2013 that limited the amount of pre-change NOLs that can be used in future years. NOLs incurred after the most recent ownership change are not subject to Section 382 of the Code and are available for use in future years. If we undergo an ownership changes, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards could be further limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Any such limitation may significantly reduce our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards before they expire. Our NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may also be impaired under state law. Accordingly, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOL carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act modifies, among other things, rules governing NOLs. NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking the NOLs into account) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, NOLs arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are subject to a five year carryback and indefinite carryforward, while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 also are subject to indefinite carryforward but cannot be carried back. In future years, if and when the valuation allowance related to our NOLs is partially or fully released, the changes\nin the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2017.\nE. STRATEGIC RISKS\nWe may be unable to establish or maintain relationships with third parties for certain aspects of continued product development, manufacturing, distribution and servicing and the supply of key components for our products.\nWe will need to maintain and may need to enter into additional strategic relationships in order to complete our current product development and commercialization plans regarding our fuel cell products, electrolyzers, hydrogen production, and potential new business markets. We may also require partners to assist in the sale, servicing and supply of components for our current products and anticipated products, which are in development. If we are unable to identify, enter into, and maintain satisfactory agreements with potential partners, including those relating to the supply, distribution, service and support of our current products and anticipated products, we may not be able to complete our product development and commercialization plans on schedule or at all. We may also need to scale back these plans in the absence of needed partners, which could adversely affect our future prospects for development and commercialization of future products. While we have entered into relationships with suppliers of some key components for our products, we do not know when or whether we will secure supply relationships for all required components and subsystems for our products, or whether such relationships will be on terms that will allow us to achieve our objectives. Our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we fail to secure relationships with entities that can develop or supply the required components for our products and provide the required distribution and servicing support. Additionally, the agreements governing our current relationships allow for termination by our partners under certain circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. If any of our current strategic partners were to terminate any of its agreements with us, there could be a material adverse impact on the continued development and profitable commercialization of our products and the operation of our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, assets or properties, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business and impair our financial results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to consider acquisitions of companies, technologies and products. We may not be able to identify such attractive acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions, involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including, among other things:\n\u25cf difficulty in integrating the technologies, products, operations and existing contracts of a target company and realizing the anticipated benefits of the combined businesses;\n\u25cf mistaken assumptions about volumes or the timing of those volumes, revenues or costs, including synergies;\n\u25cf negative perception of the acquisition by customers, financial markets or investors;\n\u25cf difficulty in supporting and transitioning customers, if any, of the target company;\n\u25cf inability to achieve anticipated synergies or increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business;\n\u25cf the assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf exposure to potential lawsuits;\n\u25cf limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf unforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas;\n\u25cf customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize; or\n\u25cf the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nIn addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted. As a result, if our forecasted assumptions for these acquisitions and investments are not accurate, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we had anticipated.\nWe may be unable to successfully pursue, integrate, or execute upon our new business ventures.\nWe have begun developing and constructing of hydrogen production plants across the United States and building relationships with green hydrogen suppliers. In the fourth quarter of 2021, for example, we acquired both Applied Cryo Technologies and Frames. There can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully implement our new business ventures or successfully operate within this industry. Additionally, the ability to successfully integrate and execute these projects is dependent upon our ability to manufacture and supply each project with a sufficient number of electrolyzers. The successful integration of our electrolyzer manufacturing objectives will affect our ability to meet demands for electrolyzers - both internally for our hydrogen production projects, and externally for third-party electrolyzer customers. Furthermore, we may expend substantial time and resources in research and development for new potential markets. There is no guarantee that these research and development initiatives will be successful or implemented. For further information on risks associated with acquisitions, see Item I.3.F \u201cRisk Factors (\u201cStrategic Risks - We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, assets or properties, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business and impair our financial results\u201d).\nF. RISKS RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price and stock trading volume have been and could remain volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. In 2021, the sales price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $73.18 per share to a low of $20.07 per share. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products, our quarterly operating results, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our perceived prospects, changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, including one or more of our strategic partners, events relating to our determination to restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Such market price volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Furthermore, technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and any related hedging or other technical trading factors. In addition, we are subject to securities class action litigation filed after a drop in the price in our common stock in March 2021, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 39,170,766 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes at a conversion price of $5.03 per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 23,806,909 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $20.64 per share and 80,017,181 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants, 75,655,478 of which were vested as of December 31, 2021.\nMoreover, subject to market conditions and other factors, we may conduct future offerings of equity or debt securities. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the conversion of the notes or preferred stock or the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and future equity issuances will result in dilution to investors.\nThe market price of our common stock could fall as a result of resales of any of these shares of common stock due to an increased number of shares available for sale in the market.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports or if they publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business and our stock, the price of our stock and the trading volume could decline.\nWe expect that the trading market for our common stock will be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. There are many large, well-established companies active in our industry and portions of the markets in which we compete, which may mean that we receive less widespread analyst coverage than our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades their evaluations of our company or our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may discourage or delay an acquisition of the Company by a third party that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware corporate law contain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board. These provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions, including the election of directors. These provisions include: the ability of our Board to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the terms of those shares, including preference and voting rights, without a stockholder vote; the exclusive right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board; the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; the prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; the ability of our Board of Directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our Board to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and staggered terms for our directors, which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, you would receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock is greater at the time you sell your shares than the market price at the time you bought your shares.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide for an exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, and the exclusive forum in the Delaware federal courts for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claims for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of, or a claim based on, a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The amended and restated bylaws further provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under\nthe Securities Act and any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions.\nWe believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides that state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\nBecause the choice of forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of severing certain causes of action between federal and state courts, stockholders seeking to assert claims against us or any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder, may be discouraged from bringing such claims due to a possibility of increased litigation expenses arising from litigating multiple related claims in two separate courts. The choice of forum provisions may therefore limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder.\nClimate change and climate change policies might affect our business, our industry, and the global economy.\nWe acknowledge the significant challenge presented by climate change, and see our transformational work in developing cost-effective, clean, renewable green hydrogen and fuel cell energy as part of the solution. Our commitment to sustainability is deeply rooted in our products, mission, core values, and people. However, we acknowledge that climate change will potentially have wide-ranging impacts, including potential impacts to our Company. Unanticipated environmental, societal, economic, or geopolitical effects of climate change might affect business operations. For example, increasingly severe and frequent weather events might disrupt our supply chain or adversely affect our customers. Relatedly, government policies addressing climate change could similarly impact our business operations. We believe that many of these policies will be favorable for our fuel cell systems and hydrogen solutions. However, there is no guarantee that such potential changes in laws, regulations, or policies will be favorable to our Company, to existing or future customers, or to large-scale economic, environmental, or geopolitical conditions. We are firm believers that our fuel cell and hydrogen solutions along with our green hydrogen strategy will play a significant role in helping to get to the scale needed to help stop the substantial damage that may otherwise occur due to the future risks of climate change. Given the global nature of climate change, we all share the responsibility of developing or supporting new methods for generating and using energy that will curb or offset greenhouse gas emissions.", "PERMNO": 87337, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "PLUG"}
