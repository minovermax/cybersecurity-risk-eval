RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below, and risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may also be materially adversely affected by factors that are not currently known to us, by factors that we currently consider immaterial or by factors that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nIf any of the following risks are actually realized, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements under \u201cSpecial Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nChanges to Medicaid, Medicaid waiver or other state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our client caseload, units of service, net service revenues, gross profit and profitability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we derived approximately 86.4% of our net service revenues from continuing operations from agreements that are directly or indirectly paid for by state and local governmental agencies, such as Medicaid funded programs and Medicaid waiver programs. Governmental agencies generally condition their agreements with us upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation. If a governmental agency does not receive an appropriation sufficient to cover its contractual obligations with us, it may terminate an agreement or defer or reduce the amount of the reimbursement we receive. Almost all the states in which we operate experience periodic financial pressures and budgetary shortfalls due to changing economic conditions and the rising costs of health care, and as a result, have made, are considering or may consider making changes in their Medicaid, Medicaid waiver or other state and local medical and social programs. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 permits states to make benefit cuts to their Medicaid programs, which could affect the services for which states contract with us. Changes that states have made or may consider making to address their budget deficits include:\n\u2022\nlimiting increases in, or decreasing, reimbursement rates;\n\u2022\nredefining eligibility standards or coverage criteria for social and medical programs or the receipt of home and community based services under those programs;\n\u2022\nincreasing the consumer\u2019s share of costs or co-payment requirements;\n\u2022\ndecreasing the number of authorized hours for recipients;\n\u2022\nslowing payments to providers;\n\u2022\nincreasing utilization of self-directed care alternatives or \u201call inclusive\u201d programs; or\n\u2022\nshifting beneficiaries to managed care organizations.\nCertain of these measures have been implemented by, or are proposed in, states in which we operate. The Governor of Illinois has proposed a budget that contemplates many of these above-mentioned changes in order to\ncontrol costs in the Illinois. In 2014, we derived approximately 60.6% of our total net service revenues from continuing operations from services provided in Illinois, 8.2% of our total net service revenues from continuing operations in New Mexico, 5.0% of our total net service revenues from continuing operations from services provided in Washington and 4.9% of our total net service revenues from continuing operations from services provided in California. Riverside, California is planning to move substantially all of its Medicaid recipients to a self-directed model for care delivery beginning in July 2015. Because a substantial portion of our business is concentrated in these states, any significant reduction in expenditures that pay for our services in these states and other states in which we do business may have a disproportionately negative impact on our future operating results. Provisions in the Health Reform Act increase eligibility for Medicaid, which may cause a reallocation of Medicaid funding. It is difficult to predict at this time what the effect of these changes would be on our business. If changes in Medicaid policy result in a reduction in available funds for the services we offer, our net service revenues could be negatively impacted.\nUnder the Health Reform Act, the federal medical assistance percentage (the \u201cFMAP\u201d) paid by the federal government to states that elect to provide Medicaid coverage to low income adults who were previously ineligible for Medicaid is 100% for calendar years 2014-2016 and gradually decreases to 90% in 2020 and thereafter. Not all states in which we do business may elect to provide coverage to newly eligible individuals. We are not able at this time to determine the impact that these changes will have on our business.\nIn March 2013, the federal government implemented certain budgetary restrictions, commonly known as sequestration. Although Medicaid is exempt from these automatic cuts, sequestration remains in place and could negatively impact reimbursement or authorizations for services under our federal or state contracts.\nA number of states have initiated efforts to combat Medicaid fraud and overpayments. If the number of Medicaid applicants or recipients is significantly reduced as a result of these efforts, the number of consumers we serve could be reduced, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nState efforts to transition their home and community based programs to being administered by managed care organizations could adversely affect our net service revenues and our profitability.\nUnder the Health Reform Act, states are encouraged to integrate the state managed Medicaid home and community based programs with managed Medicare programs. The objective of these initiatives is to enhance the coordination of benefits between the two programs and to lower overall costs.\nNationally, 18 states are currently pursuing financial or administrative alignment for dual eligible beneficiaries, including 6 of the 22 states in which we provide services. However, the timing for implementation of these demonstration projects are unknown at this time. In addition, the final regulations implementing these programs modify the requirements and definitions around home and community-based settings. We cannot assure you that: we will be able to secure favorable contracts with all or some of the managed care organizations; our reimbursement under these programs will remain at current levels; that the authorizations for services will remain at current levels or that our profitability will remain at levels consistent with past performance. If states in which we provide services transition their home and community based programs to managed care organizations and we are not able to participate through contracts with managed care organization or otherwise, we could lose revenue generated in those states, even in states in which we currently have contracts to provide home and community based services.\nIn certain states, where the transition to managed care organizations is occurring, operational processes are not well defined. Membership is being assigned by the respective state agency to the managed care organizations, but often communication of the changes is not clear to either the managed care organizations or the consumers. Membership, new referrals and the related authorization for services to be provided are being delayed, resulting in delays in service delivery to our consumers. Payments for services rendered are often delayed due to confusion in membership assignment and the referral processes. To the extent these processes are not improved, revenue growth rates, cash flow and profitability for services provided may be negatively affected.\nThe implementation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) may limit our ability to increase our market share and could adversely affect our revenues.\nCMS published final ACO regulations in October 2011, which established a shared savings program to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs. These programs are focused on efforts by hospitals and physician groups to organize and coordinate patient care and are not directed toward home and community based service providers. In addition, several states have implemented, or plan to implement, accountable care models for their Medicaid populations. If we are not included in development of these programs, or if the ACOs establish similar services to include home and community based programs for their participants, we are at risk for losing market share and for a loss of our current business. Other cost savings initiatives may be presented by the government and commercial payors to control costs and reduce hospital admissions / readmissions in which we could be financially at risk. We cannot predict at this time what effect ACOs or like organizations may have on our company.\nEfforts to reduce the costs of the Illinois Department on Aging program could adversely affect our service revenues and profitability.\nIn 2014, we derived approximately 53.2% of our revenue from continuing operations from the Illinois Department on Aging programs. Since 2011, the State of Illinois has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce the costs of the Illinois Department on Aging program, such as the mandated utilization of an electronic visit verification (EVV) system by all providers. In his budget proposal for 2016, the Governor of Illinois has suggested several measures to reduce the costs of the Illinois Department on Aging, including restrictions on new referrals and reduced authorized hours for new and existing clients. The proposal includes additional changes aimed at reducing expenditures by the Illinois Department on Aging, including an income cap and a higher threshold of need for eligibility in the Community Care Program and elimination of the add-on rate the Illinois Department on Aging had been paying Community Care Program service providers to help those providers pay for employee healthcare. It is difficult to ascertain how significant an impact these initiatives will have on our business. If they impact the eligibility of our consumers, the number of hours authorized or services provided to existing consumers, they would adversely affect our service revenues and profitability.\nDelays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits may increase in the future, adversely affecting our liquidity.\nThere is generally a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these services. The majority of the 22 states in which we operate are operating with budget deficits for their current fiscal year. These and other states may in the future delay reimbursement, which would adversely affect our liquidity. Specifically, the State of Illinois is currently reimbursing us on a delayed basis, including with respect to our agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging, our largest payor. Our reimbursements from the State of Illinois could be further delayed because current forecasts indicate higher state deficits in the near future. In addition, from time to time, procedural issues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Additionally, unanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures may adversely impact our liquidity and working capital. Because we fund our operations primarily through the collection of accounts receivable, any significant delays in reimbursement could result in the need to increase borrowings under our credit facility.\nOur revenue may be negatively impacted by a failure to appropriately document services, resulting delays in reimbursement and related indemnification obligations.\nReimbursement to us is conditioned upon providing the correct administrative and billing codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided, and the necessity for the services. If incorrect or incomplete documentation is provided or inaccurate reimbursement codes are utilized,\nthis could result in nonpayment for services rendered and could lead to allegations of billing fraud. This could subsequently lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not covered, services provided were not medically necessary, or supporting documentation was not adequate. Pursuant to the Home Health Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify the Purchasers for, among other things, (i) penalties, fines, judgments and settlement amounts arising from a violation of certain specified statutes, including the False Claims Act, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or any state law equivalent in connection with the operation of the Home Health Business prior to the Closing, and (ii) any liability related to the failure of any reimbursement claim submitted to certain government programs for services rendered by the Home Health Business prior to the Closing to meet the requirements of such government programs, or any violation prior to the Closing of any health care laws. Such liabilities include amounts to be recouped by, or repaid to, such government programs as a result of improperly submitted claims for reimbursement or those discovered as a result of audits by investigative agencies. All services that we have provided that have been or may be reimbursed by Medicare are subject to retroactive adjustments and/or total denial of payments received from Medicare under various review and audit provisions included in the program regulations. The review period is generally described as six years from the date the services are provided but could be expanded to ten years under certain circumstances if fraud is found to have existed at the time of original billing. In the event that there are adjustments relating to the period prior to the Closing, we may be required to reimburse the Purchasers or the government for the amount of such adjustments, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, timing delays may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that documentation support, system problems, provider issues or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital, and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk.\nThe implementation or expansion of self-directed care programs in states in which we operate may limit our ability to increase our market share and could adversely affect our revenue.\nSelf-directed care programs are funded by Medicaid and state and local agencies and allow the consumer to exercise discretion in selecting home and community based service providers. Consumers may hire family members, friends or neighbors to provide services that might otherwise be provided by a home and community based service agency provider, such as our company. Most states and the District of Columbia have implemented self-directed care programs, to varying degrees and for different types of consumers. States are under pressure from the federal government and certain advocacy groups to expand these programs. CMS has provided states with specific Medicaid waiver options for programs that offer person-centered planning, individual budgeting or self-directed services and support as part of the CMS Independence Plus initiative introduced in 2002 under an Executive Order of the President. Certain private foundations have also granted resources to states to develop and study programs that provide financial accounts to consumers for their long-term care needs, and counseling services to help prepare a plan of care that will help meet those needs. Expansion of these self-directed programs may erode our Medicaid consumer base and could adversely affect our net service revenues.\nFailure to renew a significant agreement or group of related agreements may materially impact our revenue.\nIn 2014, we derived approximately 53.2% of our net service revenues from continuing operations under agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging, 4.6% of our net service revenues from continuing operations under an agreement with the State of Washington and 3.4% of our net service revenues from continuing operations under an agreement with United HealthCare of New Mexico. Each of our agreements is generally in effect for a specific term. For example, the services we provide to the Illinois Department on Aging are provided under a number of agreements that expire at various times through 2015.\nEven though our agreements are for a specific term, they are generally terminable with 60 days\u2019 notice. Our ability to renew or retain our agreements depends on our quality of service and reputation, as well as other factors over which we have little or no control, such as state appropriations and changes in provider eligibility requirements. Additionally, failure to satisfy any of the numerous technical renewal requirements in connection with our proposals for agreements could result in a proposal being rejected even if it contains favorable pricing terms. Failure to obtain, renew or retain agreements with major payors may negatively impact our results of operations and revenue. We can give no assurance these agreements will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market-specific, with limited barriers to entry.\nWe compete with home and community based service providers, home health providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations and self-directed care programs. In addition, certain governmental payors contract for services with independent providers such that our relationships with these payors are not exclusive, particularly in California. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition or a larger number of consumers and payors than we do. In addition, some of these organizations offer more services than we do in the markets in which we operate. Consumers or referral sources may perceive that local service providers and not-for-profit agencies deliver higher quality services or are more responsive. These competitive advantages may limit our ability to attract and retain referrals in local markets and to increase our overall market share.\nThere are limited barriers to entry in providing home-based social and medical services, and the trend has been for states to eliminate many of the barriers that historically existed. For example, Illinois changed the way in which it procures home and community based service providers in 2009, allowing all providers that are willing and capable to obtain state approval and provide services. This may increase competition in that state, and because we derived approximately 60.6% of our net service revenues from continuing operations from services provided in Illinois in 2014, this increased competition could negatively impact our business.\nLocal competitors may develop strategic relationships with referral sources and payors. This could result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, existing competitors may offer new or enhanced services that we do not provide, or be viewed by consumers as a more desirable local alternative. The introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in revenue, a loss of market acceptance of our services and a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur profitability could be negatively affected by a reduction in reimbursement from payors.\nStates such as Illinois are experiencing large budget deficits, which may result in lower payments. The Governor of Illinois has proposed a budget for the State\u2019s fiscal year 2016 which has certain provisions that would limit the budget and related services provided by the Illinois Department on Aging. While not yet passed by the State, if enacted these changes could affect the number of clients we serve and our growth in the State. To the extent the State continues to have fiscal issues, reimbursement from the State may be negatively impacted. In addition, private payors, including commercial insurance companies, could also reduce reimbursement. Any reduction in reimbursements or imposition of copayments that dissuade the use of our services, or any reduction in reimbursement from private payors, could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation. Changes to the laws and regulations governing our business could negatively impact our profitability and any failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively. The laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, impose certain requirements on the way in which we do business, the services we offer, and our interactions with consumers and the public. These requirements include matters related to:\n\u2022\nlicensure and certification;\n\u2022\nadequacy and quality of services;\n\u2022\nqualifications and training of personnel;\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records and claims processing;\n\u2022\nthe use and disclosure of protected health information;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources;\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\naddition of facilities and services; and\n\u2022\nbilling for services.\nThese laws and regulations, including the Health Reform Act, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. These changes could reduce our profitability by increasing our liability, increasing our administrative and other costs, increasing or decreasing mandated services, forcing us to restructure our relationships with referral sources and providers or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems. Failure to comply could lead to the termination of rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs, the suspension or revocation of licenses and other civil and criminal penalties and a delay in our ability to bill and collect for services provided. We cannot assure you that the provisions described above will not adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial results. Further, we may be unable to mitigate any adverse effects resulting from the Health Reform Act.\nThe Health Reform Act amended the False Claims Act to provide that a provider must report and return overpayments within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or the claims for the services that generated the overpayments become false claims subject to the False Claims Act. Overpayments include payments for services for which the provider does not have proper documentation. If we were to identify documentation failures that could not be corrected we could be required to return payments received for those claims within the mandated 60-day time period. If we fail to identify and return overpayments within the required 60-day period we could be subject to suits under the False Claims Act by the government or relators (whistleblowers). On February 13, 2015, CMS announced that it will delay finalizing regulations that were intended to clarify when a payment is \u201cidentified\u201d for purposes of the 60-day rule. Notwithstanding the delay, providers are still required to comply with the rule even though there is considerable uncertainty over exactly when the 60-day period begins. These requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. During an internal evaluation of billing processes, we discovered documentation errors in a number of claims that we had submitted to Medicare and consistent with applicable law, in March 2014, we voluntarily remitted approximately $1,800,000 to the government. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Details of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, included elsewhere herein for more information.\nAs noted in \u201cBusiness-Overview\u201d section above, new federal regulations took effect on March 17, 2014 setting forth eligibility requirements for home and community based services provided under Medicaid waiver programs. Home and community based service providers will face costs associated with compliance with these regulations, but it is difficult to ascertain the impact of these costs at this time and these costs will vary from state to state depending on how the requirements are implemented.\nOn October 6, 2014, CMS issued a proposed rule that would revise the Medicare and Medicaid conditions of participation for home health agencies. The proposed rule would require home health agencies to develop, implement and maintain an agency-wide, data-driven quality assessment and improvement program and a system of communication and integration to identify patient needs and coordinate care. The proposed rule also aims to clarify and expand current patient rights requirements and contains several other clarifications and updates largely focused on creating a more patient-centered, data-driven, outcome-oriented process for patient care. While we sold our Home Health Business, as discussed in \u201cBusiness-Overview\u201d above, we retain some limited Medicare business as a result of our acquisition of Priority Home Health Care, Inc. and otherwise. If the proposed rule is finalized, we expect to face costs associated with compliance with such changes.\nOn December 11, 2014, CMS proposed a star rating methodology for home health agencies to meet the Health Reform Act\u2019s call for more transparent, public information on provider quality. All Medicare-certified home health agencies would be eligible to receive a star rating (from one to five stars) based on a number of quality measures, such as timely initiation of care, drug education provided to patients, fall risk assessment, depression assessments, improvements in bed transferring and bathing, among others. Ratings would be available on the Home Health Compare website. CMS is currently soliciting feedback from stakeholders on the proposed program and has set an implementation target of Summer 2015. It is not clear at this time what impact, if any, the proposed rating system would have on our remaining home health business.\nIn October 2013, California enacted the Home Care Services Consumer Protection Act. The act establishes a licensing program for home care organizations, and requires background checks, basic training, and tuberculosis screening for the aides that are employed by home care organizations. Home care organizations and aides will have until January 1, 2016 to comply with the new licensing and background check requirements. Although we sold the bulk of our home health business in California in March 2013, we continue to operate in California. The requirements of the act are expected to impose additional costs on us.\nWe are subject to various other federal and state regulations and laws, including anti-referral laws, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the False Claims Act, Fraud Alerts, HIPPA and the HITECH Act as described in the Section \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d. Failure to comply with these regulations or violations of these laws could lead to fines and exclusions or other sanctions that could have a material effect on our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws that govern our employment practices. Failure to comply with these laws, or changes to these laws that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations.\nWe are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including occupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance and equal employment opportunity laws. These laws can vary significantly among states and can be highly technical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of, among other things, changes in federal or state laws or regulations requiring employers to provide specified benefits to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in the level of existing benefits or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We may not be able to offset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws, including even a seemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, certain individuals and entities, known as excluded persons, are prohibited from receiving payment for their services rendered to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal and state healthcare program beneficiaries. If we inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or if any of our current employees or contractors becomes an excluded person in the future without our knowledge, we may be subject to substantial civil penalties, including up to $10,000 for each item or service furnished by the excluded individual to a federal or state healthcare program beneficiary, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and exclusion from the program.\nUnder the Health Reform Act, we are required to provide a minimum level of coverage for 70 percent of our full-time employees in 2015 or be subject to an annual penalty. For 2016, coverage must extend to 95% of our full-time employees. Approximately 22% of our employees are not provided any medical coverage. We are evaluating our options to minimize our exposure as a result of this requirement. If we determine that we will provide medical coverage for these employees, the costs could be material and have a significant effect on our profitability. If we determine not to offer medical coverage, we could be assessed fines or penalties for individuals who seek medical coverage through federal and state health exchanges. Depending on the number of employees who seek coverage in this manner, the penalties could be material and have a significant effect on our profitability.\nIn September 2013, the United States Department of Labor (the \u201cDepartment of Labor\u201d) announced the adoption of a rule that extended the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements of federal law to most direct care workers, such as home health aides, personal care aides and certified nursing assistants. These employees have been exempt from federal wage laws since 1974. The new rule was slated to take effect on January 1, 2015, (though the Department of Labor announced on October 7, 2014 that it would delay enforcement of the rule until June 30, 2015). However, two decisions from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, handed down on December 22, 2014 and January 14, 2015, invalidated key provisions in the rule, effectively restoring the status quo in which home care agencies and other third party employers can utilize the \u201ccompanionship services\u201d exemption to the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The applicability of the rule remains uncertain, however, as the Department of Labor filed a notice of appeal of these rulings with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on January 23, 2015.\nA number of states already require that direct care workers receive state-mandated minimum wage and/or overtime pay. Opponents say that the new protections will make in-home care more expensive for government programs such as Medicaid that pay for such services, and that the new rule could result in a reduction in covered services. We will continue to evaluate the effect of the new rule on our operations.\nWe are subject to reviews, compliance audits and investigations that could result in adverse findings that negatively affect our net service revenues and profitability.\nAs a result of our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid waiver, Medicare programs, Veterans Health Administration programs and other state and local governmental programs, and pursuant to certain of our contractual relationships, we are subject to various reviews, audits and investigations by governmental authorities and other third parties to verify our compliance with these programs and agreements as well as applicable laws, regulations and conditions of participation. Pursuant to the Home Health Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify the Purchasers for, among other things, (i) penalties, fines, judgments and settlement amounts arising from a violation of certain specified statutes, including the False Claims Act, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or any state law equivalent in connection with the operation of the Home Health Business prior to the Closing, and (ii) any liability related to the failure of any reimbursement claim submitted to certain government programs for services rendered by the Home Health Business prior to the Closing to meet the requirements of such government programs, or any violation prior to the Closing of any health care laws. Such liabilities include amounts to be recouped by, or repaid to, such government programs as a result of improperly submitted claims for reimbursement or those discovered as a result of audits by investigative agencies. All services that we have provided that have been or may be reimbursed by Medicare are subject to retroactive adjustments and/or total denial of payments received from Medicare under various review and audit provisions included in the program regulations. The review period is generally described as six years from the date the services are provided but could be expanded to ten years under certain circumstances if fraud is found to have existed at the time of original billing. In the event that there are adjustments relating to the period prior to the Closing, we may be required to reimburse the Purchasers for the amount of such adjustments, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Payments we receive in respect of Medicaid and Medicare can be retroactively adjusted after a new examination during the\nclaims settlement process or as a result of pre- or post-payment audits. Federal, state and local government payors may disallow our requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable because proper documentation was not provided or because certain services were not covered or deemed necessary. In addition, other third-party payors may reserve rights to conduct audits and make reimbursement adjustments in connection with or exclusive of audit activities. Significant adjustments as a result of these audits could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIf we fail to meet any of the conditions of participation or coverage with respect to state licensure or our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid waiver, Medicare programs, Veterans Health Administration programs and other state and local governmental programs, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable surveyor or authority. Failure to institute a plan of action to correct the deficiency within the period provided by the surveyor or authority could result in civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of fines or other sanctions, damage to our reputation, cancellation of our agreements, suspension or revocation of our licenses or disqualification from federal and state reimbursement programs. These actions may adversely affect our ability to provide certain services, to receive payments from other payors and to continue to operate. Additionally, actions taken against one of our locations may subject our other locations to adverse consequences. We may also fail to discover all instances of noncompliance by our acquisition targets, which could subject us to adverse remedies once those acquisitions are complete. Any termination of one or more of our locations from any federal, state or local program for failure to satisfy such program\u2019s conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenues and profitability.\nNegative publicity or changes in public perception of our services may adversely affect our ability to receive referrals, obtain new agreements and renew existing agreements.\nOur success in receiving referrals, obtaining new agreements and renewing our existing agreements depends upon maintaining our reputation as a quality service provider among governmental authorities, physicians, hospitals, discharge planning departments, case managers, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, advocacy groups, consumers and their families, other referral sources and the public. While we believe that the services that we provide are of high quality, if studies mandated by Congress in the Health Reform Act to make public quality measures are implemented and if our quality measures are deemed to be not of the highest value, our reputation could be negatively affected. Negative publicity, changes in public perceptions of our services or government investigations of our operations could damage our reputation and hinder our ability to receive referrals, retain agreements or obtain new agreements. Increased government scrutiny may also contribute to an increase in compliance costs and could discourage consumers from using our services. Any of these events could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, in connection with the sale of our Home Health Business, we granted a license to the Purchasers that allows them to use certain of our intellectual property, including the Addus name, for the provision of skilled nursing and related physical therapy healthcare services to individuals in their homes and hospice services in California, Illinois, Arkansas, South Carolina and Nevada. Although the use of the intellectual property is required to be consistent and at least equal to the level of quality and brand perception prior to the sale, we do not have operational control over the Purchasers. As a result, home health agencies operated by the Purchasers may not be operated in a manner consistent with the standards we uphold at our agencies. If such agencies do not maintain operational standards consistent with the standards we demand of our agencies, the image and brand reputation of Addus may suffer and our business may be materially affected.\nOur growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations and we may not be successful in managing this growth.\nOur business plan calls for significant growth in business over the next several years through the expansion of our services in existing markets and the establishment of a presence in new markets. This growth will place significant demands on our management team, systems, internal controls and financial and professional\nresources. In addition, we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth. This could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our inability to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nFuture acquisitions or growth initiatives may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nOur growth strategy includes geographical expansion into new markets and the addition of new services in existing markets through the acquisition of local service providers. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties assimilating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or consumers of acquired providers, and the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired providers. In the past, we have made acquisitions that have not performed as expected or that we have been unable to successfully integrate with our existing operations. In addition, our due diligence review of acquired businesses may not successfully identify all potential issues. For example, we were unable to fully integrate one acquired business because we were unable to procure a necessary government endorsement. The failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nWe have grown our business through de novo locations and we may in the future open new locations in existing and new markets. De novo locations involve risks, including those relating to accreditation, hiring new personnel, establishing relationships with referral sources and delays or difficulty in installing our operating and information systems. We may not be successful in establishing de novo locations in a timely manner due to generating insufficient business activity and incurring higher than projected operating cost that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to pursue acquisitions or expand into new geographic regions without obtaining additional capital or consent from our lenders.\nAt December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had cash balances of $13,363,000 and $15,565,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had no outstanding debt on our credit facility. After giving effect to the amount drawn on our credit facility, approximately $15,464,000 of outstanding letters of credit and borrowing limits based on an advanced multiple of adjusted EBITDA, we had $39,536,000 available for borrowing under the credit facility as of December 31, 2014. Since our credit facility provides for borrowings based on a multiple of an EBITDA ratio, any declines experienced in our EBITDA would result in a decrease in our available borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe cannot predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts, our efforts to expand into new geographic regions or the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our credit facility, our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing. In the future, we may elect to issue additional equity securities in conjunction with raising capital, completing an acquisition or expanding into a new geographic region. Such issuances would be dilutive to existing shareholders. In addition, our credit facility prohibits us from consummating more than three acquisitions in any calendar year, and, in any event, does not permit the purchase price for any one acquisition to exceed $2,000,000, in each case without the consent of the lenders. The consideration we paid in connection with 12 of the 15 acquisitions we completed exceeded $2,000,000. In addition, our credit facility requires, among other things, that we are in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth therein and that no event of default exists before and after giving effect to any proposed acquisition. Our ability to expand in a manner consistent with historic practices may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consent from our lenders.\nAccess to additional capital and credit markets, at a reasonable cost, may be necessary for us to fund our operations, including potential acquisitions and working capital requirements. We currently rely on one financial\ninstitution for funding under our credit facility and any instability in the financial markets or the negative impact of local, national and worldwide economic conditions on that financial institution could impact our short and long-term liquidity needs to meet our business requirements.\nAs a result of the indemnification provisions of the Home Health Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold Home Health Business, we may incur expenses and liabilities related to periods up to the date of sale or pursuant to our other indemnification obligations thereunder.\nAs a result of the indemnification provisions of the Home Health Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we sold the Home Health Business, we have agreed to indemnify the Purchasers for, among other things, (i) penalties, fines, judgments and settlement amounts arising from a violation of certain specified statutes, including the False Claims Act, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or any state law equivalent in connection with the operation of the Home Health Business prior to the Closing, and (ii) any liability related to the failure of any reimbursement claim submitted to certain government programs for services rendered by the Home Health Business prior to the Closing to meet the requirements of such government programs, or any violation prior to the Closing of any health care laws. Such liabilities include amounts to be recouped by, or repaid to, such government programs as a result of improperly submitted claims for reimbursement or those discovered as a result of audits by investigative agencies. All services that we have provided that have been or may be reimbursed by Medicare are subject to retroactive adjustments and/or total denial of payments received from Medicare under various review and audit provisions included in the program regulations. The review period is generally described as six years from the date the services are provided but could be expanded to ten years under certain circumstances if fraud is found to have existed at the time of original billing. In the event that there are adjustments relating to the period prior to the Closing, we may be required to reimburse the Purchasers for the amount of such adjustments, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Home Health Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to indemnify the Purchasers for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants, certain taxes and liabilities related to the pre-Closing period (other than specifically identified assumed liabilities). Any liability we have to the Purchasers under the Home Health Purchase Agreement could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business may be harmed by labor relations matters.\nWe are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because our hourly workforce is highly unionized. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 61.3% of our workforce was represented by two national unions, including the Service Employees International Union, which is our largest union. We have a national agreement with the SEIU. Wages and benefits are negotiated at the local level at various times throughout the year. These negotiations are often initiated when we receive increases in our hourly rates from various state agencies. Upon expiration of these collective bargaining agreements, we may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms with these labor unions. A strike, work stoppage or other slowdown could result in a disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business. Labor costs are the most significant component of our total expenditures and, therefore, an increase in the cost of labor could significantly harm our business.\nOur operations subject us to risk of litigation.\nOperating in the home and community based services industry exposes us to an inherent risk of wrongful death, personal injury, professional malpractice and other potential claims or litigation brought by our consumers and employees. Because we operate in this industry, from time to time, we are subject to claims alleging that we did not properly treat or care for a consumer that we failed to follow internal or external procedures that resulted in death or harm to a consumer or that our employees mistreated our consumers, resulting in death or harm. We are also subject to claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions brought by consumers whom we\nare transporting or from employees driving to or from home visits. We operate five adult day centers which provide transportation for our elderly and disabled consumers. Each of our vehicles transports 7 to 14 passengers to and from our locations. The concentration of consumers in one vehicle increases the risk of larger claims being brought against us in the event of an accident.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies may initiate administrative proceedings alleging violations of statutes and regulations arising from our services and seek to impose monetary penalties on us. We could be required to pay substantial amounts to respond to regulatory investigations or, if we do not prevail, damages or penalties arising from these legal proceedings. We also are subject to potential lawsuits under the False Claims Act or other federal and state whistleblower statutes designed to combat fraud and abuse in our industry. These lawsuits can involve significant monetary awards or penalties which may not be covered by our insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage and self-insurance coverage reserves are not adequate to cover these claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are successful in our defense, civil lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could distract us from running our business or irreparably damage our reputation.\nOur insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs.\nAlthough we maintain insurance consistent with industry practice, the insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to satisfy all claims made against us. For example, we have a $350,000 deductible per person/per occurrence under our workers\u2019 compensation insurance program. We cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of our insurance, and any such claims, if successful and in excess of such limits, may have a material adverse effect on our business or assets. We utilize historical data to estimate our reserves for our insurance programs. If losses on asserted claims exceed the current insurance coverage and accrued reserves, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Changes in our annual insurance costs and self-insured retention limits depend in large part on the insurance market, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms.\nInclement weather or natural disasters may impact our ability to provide services.\nInclement weather may prevent our employees from providing authorized services. We are not paid for authorized services that are not delivered due to these weather events. Furthermore, prolonged inclement weather or the occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could disrupt our relationships with consumers, employees and referral sources located in affected areas and, in the case of our corporate office, our ability to provide administrative support services, including billing and collection services. For example, our corporate headquarters and a number of our agencies are located in the midwestern United States and California, increasing our exposure to blizzards and other major snowstorms, ice storms, tornados, flooding and earthquakes. Future inclement weather or natural disasters may adversely affect our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on our information systems. Our operations may be disrupted if we are unable to effectively integrate, manage and maintain the security of our information systems.\nOur business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimizing financial performance, adjusting consumer mix, monitoring regulatory compliance and enhancing staff efficiency. We rely on an external service provider, McKesson, to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of our primary information systems used for our operational needs. The software we license from McKesson supports intake, personnel scheduling, office clinical and centralized billing and receivables management in an integrated database, enabling us to standardize the care delivered across our network of locations and monitor our performance and consumer outcomes. To the extent that McKesson fails to support the software or systems, or if we lose our license with McKesson, our operations could be negatively affected.\nOur business also depends on a comprehensive payroll and human resources system for basic payroll functions and reporting, payroll tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments. We rely on an external service provider, Ultimate Software, to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of our primary human resource and payroll systems. To the extent that Ultimate Software fails to support the software or systems, or any of the related support services provided by them, our internal operations could be negatively affected.\nBecause of the confidential health information and consumer records we store and transmit, loss of electronically-stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation and liability.\nIf we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain, or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, and increases in administrative expenses.\nWe have full backup of our key information systems. Should our support center become inoperable as a result of a natural disaster or terrorist acts, it would take substantial amount of time and resources to restore our business to the current state of operation. This risk is becoming even more critical as we are centralizing more of our business operations. The disruption to the business would be material and would affect our operational and financial performance.\nWe rely on several vendors for telecommunication and internet access, with a high percentage of our agencies supported by one vendor. To the extent services are interrupted, our individual offices may lose basic telephone service and access to our centralized computer systems. To the extent these delays are frequent, or impact a large number of offices, or occur for extended periods of time, it could disrupt our business and would have a negative effect on our ability to serve our clients and potentially have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nOur business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and consumer data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in our services or operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems which could disrupt our operations or make our systems inaccessible. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of consumers if security breaches are not prevented.\nIn addition, we are required to comply with the privacy and security laws and regulations of HIPAA and the HITECH Act. If our privacy and security practices are not in compliance with HIPAA and/or if we fail to satisfy the breach notification requirements of the HITECH Act in the event of a security breach, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties. Penalties under the HIPAA (as increased by the HITECH Act) can be as high as $50,000 per violation (with an annual maximum of $1,500,000) depending on the degree of culpability.\nThe agreements that govern our credit facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business.\nOur credit facility agreement requires us to comply with customary financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain a maximum fixed charge ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, and limit our capital expenditures. Our credit facility also includes non-financial covenants including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\ntransfer assets, enter into mergers, make acquisitions or experience fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans and advances;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee obligations;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\nenter into affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions other than in the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nincur capital lease obligations;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditure; and\n\u2022\npay dividends.\nOur current principal stockholders have significant influence over us, and they could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree.\nEos Capital Partners III, L.P. and Eos Partners SBIC III, L.P., or the Eos Funds, together beneficially own approximately 36.5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014. As a result, the Eos Funds have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:\n\u2022\nchanges to the composition of our board of directors, which has the authority to direct our business and appoint and remove our officers;\n\u2022\nproposed mergers, consolidations or other business combinations; and\n\u2022\namendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which govern the rights attached to our shares of common stock.\nIn addition, one of our directors is affiliated with the Eos Funds.\nThis concentration of ownership of shares of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open-market purchase programs or other purchases of shares of our common stock that might otherwise give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. The interests of the Eos Funds may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may not be able to attract, train and retain qualified personnel.\nWe must attract and retain qualified personnel in the markets in which we operate in order to provide our services. We compete for personnel with other providers of social and medical services as well as companies in other service-based industries. Competition may be greater for skilled personnel, such as regional and agency directors. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide employees with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries.\nThe loss of one or more of the members of the executive management team or the inability of a new management team to successfully execute our strategies may adversely affect our business. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to provide our services, the quality of our services may decline, and we could lose consumers and referral sources.\nWe may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health catastrophe than other businesses due to the nature of our consumers.\nThe majority of our consumers are older individuals with complex medical challenges, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or in a public health catastrophe. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable consumers. For example, if a flu pandemic were to occur, we could suffer significant losses to our consumer population or a reduction in the availability of our employees and, at a high cost, be required to hire replacements for affected workers. Accordingly, certain public health catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees.\nOur success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team. We also depend upon the continued employment of the individuals that manage several of our key functional areas, including operations, business development, accounting, finance, human resources, marketing, information systems, contracting and compliance. The departure of any member of our senior management team may materially adversely affect our operations.\nIf we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill and/or our intangible assets, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nGoodwill and intangible assets with finite lives represent a significant portion of our assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. If our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If as part of our annual review of goodwill and intangibles, we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill and/or intangible assets, our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected, which could affect our flexibility to obtain additional financing. In addition, if our assumptions used in preparing our valuations for purposes of impairment testing differ materially from actual future results, we may record impairment charges in the future and our financial results may be materially adversely affected. We had $64,220,000 of goodwill and $10,347,000 of intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014.\nIt is not possible at this time to determine if there will be any future impairment charge, or if there is, whether such charges would be material. We will continue to review our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment. We cannot be certain that a downturn in our business or changes in market conditions will not result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods, which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of all securities, including securities of health care companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance;\n\u2022\nvariances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nwe have a small base of registered shares of common stock consisting of the 5,400,000 shares we issued in our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), which represents approximately 49.0% of our total common shares outstanding, that could result in significant stock price movements upward or downward based on low levels of trading volume in our common stock;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our business and our prospects;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in health care laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; or\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and stock market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of homecare companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities. We have been and may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management team\u2019s attention as well as resources from the operation of our business.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not pay dividends on our shares of common stock and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, credit facility limitations, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to publish research or reports about our business or publish negative research or reports, or our results are below analysts\u2019 estimates, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If analysts fail to publish reports on us regularly or at all, we could fail to gain visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more analysts do cover us and downgrade their evaluations of our stock or our results are below analysts\u2019 estimates, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, due to the small number of analysts covering us, a single comment or report from one of the analysts whether positive or negative, could result in a significant increase or decrease in our stock price.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions may also have the\neffect of making it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management without the consent of the board of directors. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that could delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control include:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This section generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner. However, because the Eos Funds acquired their shares prior to our IPO, Section 203 is currently inapplicable to any business combination with the Eos Funds or their affiliates. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws require that any stockholder proposals or nominations for election to our board of directors must meet specific advance notice requirements and procedures, which make it more difficult for our stockholders to make proposals or director nominations.\nIf we fail to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our business and stock price could be adversely impacted.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires our management to report on, and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Compliance with SEC regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has increased our legal and financial compliance costs making some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nAs a result of our increased stock price and overall market value as of the end of the second quarter of 2013, we became subject to the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Accordingly, we are now required to have an audit of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIf we fail to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and sanctions, our ability to raise capital could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nCompliance with changing regulations including specific program compliance, corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and pose challenges for our management team.\nThe state agencies that contract for our services require our compliance with various rules and regulations affecting the services we provide. We have a compliance officer who monitors and reports on our efforts for achieving the desired results. State agencies are recommending increased rules and regulations in an effort to control the growth of these programs and their overall costs. The implementation of these changes may require the Company to increase their efforts to remain compliant, may reduce the authorizations for services to be provided, may result in certain consumers no longer being eligible for our services all of which may result in lower revenues and increased costs, reducing our operating performance and profitability. If we continue to serve our consumers without addressing these increased regulations we are at risk for non-compliance with program requirements and potential penalties.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated there-under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and\nsignificantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. We are committed to maintaining high standards of internal controls over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nDeclines in earnings could create future liquidity problems.\nThe availability of funds under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility, is based on the lesser of (i) the product of adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, for the most recent 12-month period for which financial statements have been delivered under the credit agreement multiplied by the specified advance multiple, up to 3.25, less the outstanding senior indebtedness and letters of credit, and (ii) $55,000,000 less the outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit. Interest on the revolving line of credit may be payable at (i) a floating rate equal to the one-month LIBOR, plus a margin of 3.5%, (ii) the LIBOR rate for term periods of one, two or three months, plus a margin of 3.5% or (iii) the base rate, plus a margin of 1.6%, where the base rate is equal to the greatest of (a) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the \u201cprime rate,\u201d (b) the sum of the federal funds rate, plus a margin of 0.5% and (c) the sum of the adjusted LIBOR that would be applicable to a loan with a one month interest period advanced on such day, plus a margin of 3%. We pay a fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the unused portion of the revolving portion of the credit facility. Issued stand-by letters of credit are charged at a rate of 2.0% per annum payable monthly. We did not have any amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2014, and the total availability under the revolving credit loan facility was $39,536,000 as of December 31, 2014.\nThe current federal and state economic and reimbursement environments and state budgetary pressures to decrease or eliminate services we provide could negatively affect our future earnings. This decrease in earnings would reduce the availability of funds under our credit facility which could have a negative impact on our future operating results.", "PERMNO": 93073, "SIC": 8082, "TIC": "ADUS"}
