RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this document. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nA1.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations in 2020 and may continue to do so thereafter. There can be no assurance that our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations will revert to pre-2020 levels once the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic cease.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted worldwide economic and commercial activity and financial markets, as well as global demand for petroleum products in 2020 and is expected to continue in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic also created simultaneous shocks in oil supply, demand, and pricing resulting in an economic challenge to our industry which has not occurred since our formation. The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses, as well as developments in the global oil markets, resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders, and limitations on the availability of workforces. As a result of commodity price volatility and decreased demand for our products, our business results and cash flows were significantly adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, Blue Dolphin\u2019s income and cash flow from operations reflected a loss of $7.9 million and use of cash of $3.9 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to income of $5.5 million and use of cash of $8.2 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. We expect the combination of abnormal volatility in commodity prices and significant decreased demand for our refined products to continue for the foreseeable future.\nThe duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related market developments is unknown. The continued negative impact of these events on our business and operations will depend on the ongoing severity, location and duration of the effects and spread of COVID-19, the effectiveness of vaccine programs, other actions undertaken by federal, state, and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects, and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume in 2021 or thereafter. We continue to take measures to lessen the impact of the pandemic on our operations and limit the spread of the virus among personnel. For example, we operated the Nixon facility at reduced rates in 2020 based on market conditions and staffing levels, and we expect to continue adjusting the facility\u2019s operating rate until market and other conditions substantially improve. We have carefully evaluated projects and, as a result, have limited or postponed projects and other non-essential work. We have planned a level of capital expenditures we believe will allow us to satisfy and comply with all required safety, environmental, and planned regulatory capital commitments and other regulatory requirements, although there are no assurances that we will be able to continue to do so. Non-compliance with applicable environmental and safety requirements, including as a result of reduced staff due to an outbreak of the virus at one of our locations, may impair our operations, subject us to fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities, and/or result in an environmental or safety incident. We may also be subject to liability as a result of claims against us by impacted workers or third parties.\nContinued disruptions to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations. There can also be no assurance that our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations will revert to pre-2020 levels once the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic cease. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks associated with our company, our business, and our industry, as those risk factors are amended or supplemented by reports and documents that we file with the SEC after the date of this Form 10-K.\nA2.\nThe persistence or worsening of market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic may require us to raise additional capital to operate our business or refinance existing debt on terms that are not acceptable to us or not at all.\nOur primary cash requirements relate to: (i) purchasing crude oil and condensate for the operation of the Nixon refinery, (ii) reimbursing LEH for direct operating expenses and paying the LEH operating fee under the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement and (iii) servicing debt. In instances where we experience a working capital deficit, we have historically relied on Affiliates to meet our liquidity needs. We are actively exploring additional financing; however, we currently have no arrangements for additional capital and no assurances can be given that we will be able to raise sufficient capital when needed, on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions and the capital markets make it more challenging to raise capital. Adverse effects include a global tightening of credit and liquidity, reduced availability, increased cost of credit, and a slow down the decision-making of financial institutions. These factors could materially and negatively affect the availability, timing, and cost for which we may obtain any additional funding for working capital purposes or to refinance existing debt. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital in the very near term, we may further default on our payment obligations under certain of our existing debt obligations. Without additional financing, it remains unclear whether we will have or can obtain sufficient liquidity to withstand COVID-19 disruptions to our business.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nA3.\nContinued or further deterioration in demand for our refined products could negatively affect our operations and financial condition.\nBusiness closings and layoffs in the markets we operate have adversely affected demand for our refined products. Sustained deterioration of general economic conditions or weak demand levels persisting in 2021 could require additional actions on our part, such as temporarily or permanently ceasing to operate the Nixon facility to lower our operating costs or reconfigure the Nixon facility to increase flexibility to be responsive to evolving market conditions, including potentially pivoting to renewable fuels. There may be significant incremental costs or impairment charges associated with such actions. Continued or further deterioration of economic conditions may harm our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt and the trading price of Blue Dolphin\u2019s Common Stock.\nA4.\nPotential impairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Under generally accepted accounting principles, long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment annually or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. If business conditions or other factors cause the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for long-lived assets to fall below their carrying value, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Events and conditions that could result in impairment in the value of our long-lived assets include lower realized refining margins, decreased refinery production, other factors leading to a reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability, or significant changes in the manner of use for the assets or the overall business strategy.\nIn this challenging business environment, we continuously monitor our assets for impairment, as well as optimization opportunities. We evaluated our refinery and facilities assets for impairment as of June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020. Although no indicators of asset impairment were identified as of each reporting period indicated, an impairment may be required in the future as the long-term impact of the crisis becomes clearer, losses continue to be material, or as new opportunities arise, such as reconfiguration of the Nixon refinery into a renewable fuels facility.\nSignificant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results that are used in the preparation of projected cash flows. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Should our assumptions significantly change in future periods, it is possible we may later determine the carrying values of our refinery and facilities assets exceed the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows, which would result in a future impairment charge.\nB.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nB1.\nManagement has determined that there is, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement has determined that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, margin deterioration and volatility, and historic net losses and working capital deficits. Our consolidated financial statements assume we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.A \u2018going concern\u2019 opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on sustained positive operating margins and having working capital for, amongst other requirements, purchasing crude oil and condensate and making payments on long-term debt. Without positive operating margins and working capital, our business will be jeopardized, and we may not be able to continue. If we are unable to make required debt payments, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our creditors to restructure our applicable obligations, including potentially filing for bankruptcy.\nB2.\nWe have inadequate liquidity to sustain operations due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, margin deterioration and volatility, and historic net losses and working capital deficits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe currently rely on revenue from operations, including sales of refined products and rental of petroleum storage tanks, and Affiliates to meet our liquidity needs. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to acquisition of crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon refinery, repayment of short-term debt obligations, and capital expenditures for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment of equipment at the Nixon facility. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations. In addition, we continue to utilize capital to reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. We may incur substantial compliance costs relating to any new environmental, health and safety regulations. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy any of these needs.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nWe had a working capital deficit of $72.3 million and $59.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, we had a working capital deficit of $22.9 million and $19.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash (current portion), and restricted cash (noncurrent) were as follow:\nIn instances where we experience a working capital deficit, we have historically relied on Affiliates to meet our liquidity needs. We are actively exploring additional financing; however, we currently have no arrangements for additional capital and no assurances can be given that we will be able to raise sufficient capital when needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital in the very near term, we may further default on our payment obligations under certain of our existing debt obligations. Without additional financing, it remains unclear whether we will have or can obtain sufficient liquidity to withstand COVID-19 disruptions to our business. If we do not have sufficient liquidity, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our creditors to restructure our applicable obligations, including potentially filing for bankruptcy.\nB3.\nOur substantial current debt, which is included in the current portion of long-term debt (in default), long-term debt, related party (in default), and line of credit payable (in default), could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had current debt of $57.7 million and $51.3 million, respectively, consisting of bank debt, related party debt, and a line of credit payable. Blue Dolphin, as parent company, has guaranteed the indebtedness of certain subsidiaries. In addition, Affiliates have guaranteed the indebtedness of Blue Dolphin and certain of its subsidiaries. This level of debt in current liabilities and the cross guarantee agreements could have important consequences, such as: (i) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or potential growth, or for other purposes; (ii) increasing the cost of future borrowings; (iii) limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt; (iv) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt; and (v) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nAs of the filing date of this report, we were current with the monthly payments required under our bank debt; however, partial payments are being made monthly to the line of credit payable as a tank lease setoff using amounts NPS is due from Pilot under two tank lease agreements. Our ability to service our debt is dependent upon, among other things, business conditions, our financial and operating performance, our ability to raise capital, and regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our working capital is not sufficient to service our debt, and any future indebtedness that we incur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nB4.\nOur ability to regain compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness depends on us generating sufficient cash flow to meet debt service obligations or refinancing or restructuring the debt.\nAs described elsewhere in this report, we are in default under our secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties. Defaults include events of default and financial covenant violations, as follow:\n\u25cf\nVeritex - At December 31, 2020, LE and LRM were in violation of the debt service coverage ratio, current ratio, and debt to net worth ratio financial covenants under our secured loan agreements with Veritex. As of the filing date of this report, payments under the Veritex loans were current, but other defaults remained outstanding.\n\u25cf\nPilot - The Amended Pilot Line of Credit matured in May 2020. Pursuant to a June 1, 2020 notice, Pilot began applying Pilot\u2019s payment obligations to NPS under each of (a) the Terminal Services Agreement (covering Tank Nos. 67, 71, 72, 73, 77, and 78), dated as of May 2019, between NPS and Pilot, and (b) the Terminal Services Agreement (covering Tank No. 56), dated as of June 1, 2019, between NPS and Pilot, against NPS\u2019 payment obligations to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. The tank lease setoff amounts only partially satisfy NPS\u2019 obligations to Pilot, and Pilot expressly retained and reserved all its rights and remedies available to it at any time, including, without limitation, the right to exercise all rights and remedies available to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit or applicable law or equity. For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the tank lease setoff amounts totaled $1.3 million and $0, respectively. For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of interest NPS incurred under the Amended Pilot line of credit totaled $1.0 million and $0, respectively. On November 23, 2020, NPS and guarantors received notice from Pilot that the entry into the SBA EIDLs was a breach of the Amended Pilot Line of Credit and Pilot demanded full repayment of the Obligations, including through use of the proceeds of the SBA EIDLs. Pilot also notified the SBA that the liens securing the SBA EIDLs are junior to those securing the Obligations. While the SBA acknowledged this point and indicated a willingness to subordinate the SBA EIDLs, no further action has been taken by Pilot as of the filing date of this report.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\n\u25cf\nNotre Dame Debt - Pursuant to a 2015 subordination agreement, the holder of the Notre Dame Debt agreed to subordinate their right to payments from LE, as well as any security interest and liens on the Nixon facility\u2019s business assets, in favor of Veritex as holder of the LE Term Loan Due 2034. To date, no payments have been made under the subordinated Notre Dame Debt and the holder of the Notre Dame Debt has taken no action as a result of the non-payment.\n\u25cf\nRelated Party Debt - Affiliates controlled approximately 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report, an Affiliate operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties, an Affiliate is a significant customer of our refined products, and we borrow from Affiliates during periods of working capital deficits. Replated party debt, which is currently in default, represents such working capital borrowings.\nDefaults under our secured loan agreements with third parties permit Veritex and Pilot to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise their rights with respect to collateral securing obligors\u2019 obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. The debt associated with secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties was classified within the current portion of long-term debt (in default), long-term debt, related party (in default), and line of credit payable (in default) on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOur ability to regain compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet debt service obligations or refinance or restructure the debt. This is dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance, and the general condition of the financial markets. We can provide no assurance that our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our secured loan agreements. Continued disruptions to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations. There can also be no assurance that our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations will revert to pre-2020 levels once the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic cease. Given the current financial markets, we can provide no assurance that we can successfully generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our outstanding debt or otherwise restructure or refinance the debt. We could be forced to undertake alternate financings, including a sale of additional common stock, negotiate for an extension of the maturity, or sell assets and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay such indebtedness. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to consummate any such transaction on terms that are commercially reasonable, on terms acceptable to us or at all. If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company\u2019s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify. If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company\u2019s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify. In the event we are unsuccessful in such endeavors, we may be unable to pay the amounts outstanding, which may require us to seek protection under bankruptcy laws. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock and the value of an investment in our common stock could significantly decrease, which could lead to holders of our common stock losing their investment in our common stock in its entirety.\nB5.\nOur business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit.\nAdverse changes to the availability, terms and cost of capital, interest rates or our credit ratings (which would have a corresponding impact on the credit ratings of our subsidiaries that are party to any cross-guarantee agreements) could cause our cost of doing business to increase by limiting our access to capital, including our ability to refinance maturing or accelerated existing indebtedness on similar terms. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all. Any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms, we may further reduce our expenses and we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels; (ii) successfully implement our business strategy; (iii) fund certain obligations as they become due; (iv) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements; or (v) repay our indebtedness. Based on the historical negative cash flows and the continued limited cash inflows in the period subsequent to year end there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nB6.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt instruments may limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nVarious covenants in our debt instruments may restrict our financial flexibility in a number of ways. Our current indebtedness subjects us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments and investments, consummate certain asset sales or asset swaps, conduct businesses other than our current businesses, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Some of our debt instruments also require us to satisfy or maintain certain financial condition tests in certain circumstances. Our ability to meet these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not meet such tests. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our existing debt could result in a further event of default that could enable our lenders, subject to the terms and conditions of such debt, to declare the outstanding principal, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Events beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses, volatility in commodity prices, and extreme weather resulting from climate change may affect our ability to comply with our covenants. If we are unable to repay the accelerated amounts, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, defaults under our other debt instruments, if any, may be triggered, and our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full.\nDuring the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, we received two small loans totaling $0.3 million in the aggregate under federal or other governmental programs to support our operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loans provided or guaranteed by the U.S. government, including pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020, subject us to additional restrictions on our operations, including limitations on personnel headcount and compensation reductions and other cost reduction activities that could adversely affect us.\nB7.\nAffiliates hold a significant ownership interest in us and exert significant influence over us, and their interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders; Affiliate transactions may cause conflicts of interest that may adversely affect us.\nAffiliates controlled approximately 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report and, by virtue of such stock ownership, can control or exert substantial influence over us, including:\n\u25cf\nElection and appointment of directors;\n\u25cf\nBusiness strategy and policies;\n\u25cf\nMergers and other business combinations;\n\u25cf\nAcquisition or disposition of assets;\n\u25cf\nFuture issuances of Common Stock or other securities; and\n\u25cf\nIncurrence of debt or obtaining other sources of financing.\nThe existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding Common Stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nAffiliate interest may not always be consistent with our interests or with the interests of our other stockholders. Affiliates may also pursue acquisitions or business opportunities in industries in which we compete, and there is no requirement that any additional business opportunities be presented to us. We also have and may in the future enter transactions to purchase goods or services with Affiliates. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between us and Affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or its other stockholders.\nThese relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nB8.\nThe dangers inherent in oil and gas operations could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities, and reduce our liquidity.\nOil and gas operations are inherently subject to significant hazards and risks. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, ruptures, blowouts, spills, third-party interference and equipment failure, any of which could result in interruption or termination of operations, pollution, personal injury and death, or damage to our assets and the property of others. These risks could result in substantial losses to us from injury and loss of life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. Offshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as hurricanes or other severe weather conditions, and more extensive governmental regulation. These regulations may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for pollution damage or result in the interruption or termination of operations. These risks could harm our reputation and business, result in claims against us, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nB9.\nThe geographic concentration of our assets creates a significant exposure to the risks of the regional economy and other regional adverse conditions.\nOur primary operating assets are in Nixon, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale, and we market our refined products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. In addition, we have facilities and related onshore pipeline assets in Freeport, Texas, and offshore pipelines and oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our operations are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Any changes in market conditions, unforeseen circumstances, or other events affecting the area in which our assets are located could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather, demographics, and population.\nB10.\nCompetition from companies having greater financial and other resources could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe refining industry is highly competitive. Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast), domestic refiners in other PADD regions, and foreign refiners that import products into the U.S. Certain of our competitors have larger, more complex refineries and may be able to realize higher margins per barrel of product produced. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and have access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain all our feedstocks from a single supplier. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, larger, more complex refineries may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as crude oil and other feedstocks supply shortages or commodity price fluctuations. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers.\nB11.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remain in compliance or to remediate current or future contamination that could give rise to material liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the environment, product specifications and the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and remediation of solid and hazardous wastes. Violations of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.\nIn addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations, or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. The requirements to be met, as well as the technology and length of time available to meet those requirements, continue to develop and change. Expenditures or costs for environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and profitability. For example, President Biden has issued an executive order seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and to consider suspending, revising, or rescinding prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration\u2019s climate policies. The current administration may take further actions that could restrict or limit operations as currently conducted at the Nixon Facility.\nThe Nixon facility operates under several federal and state permits, licenses, and approvals with terms and conditions that contain a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards. These permits, licenses, approvals, limits, and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval, limit or standard. Non-compliance or incomplete documentation of our compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. Additionally, there may be times when we are unable to meet the standards and terms and conditions of our permits, licenses and approvals due to operational upsets or malfunctions, which may lead to the imposition of fines and penalties or operating restrictions that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our facilities, and accordingly our financial performance.\nB12.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding personnel and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and profitability.\nWe are subject to the requirements of OSHA, SEMS, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection, health, and safety of workers, and the proper design, operation and maintenance of our equipment. In addition, OSHA and certain other environmental regulations require that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to personnel and state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, may result in significant fines or compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nB13.\nOur insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs, or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums.\nOur insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim. We do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Losses in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in the insurance markets subsequent to certain hurricanes and other natural disasters have made it more difficult and more expensive to obtain certain types of coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance, or failure by one or more of our insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Insurance companies may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or may demand significantly higher premiums or deductibles to cover our assets. If significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost. There is no assurance that our insurers will renew their insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. The unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nB14.\nOur ability to use NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.\nUnder IRC Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Within the meaning of IRC Section 382, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nBlue Dolphin experienced ownership changes in 2005 because of a series of private placements, and in 2012 because of a reverse acquisition. The 2012 ownership change limits our ability to utilize NOLs following the 2005 ownership change that were not previously subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect, and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated after the 2012 ownership change are not subject to limitation. If the IRS were to challenge our NOLs in an audit, we cannot assure that we would prevail against such challenge. If the IRS were successful in challenging our NOLs, all or some portion of our NOLs would not be available to offset any future consolidated income, which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in 2017, may also limit our ability to utilize our net operating tax loss carryforwards.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, management determined that cumulative losses incurred over the prior three-year period provided significant objective evidence that limited the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth. Based on this evaluation, we recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nB15.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or development new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. We may not be able to respond do these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nB16.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our production and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers\u2019 operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nB17.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats.\nA cyberattack or similar incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, damage to our reputation or financial loss. Our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production, processing and financial activities. Our technologies, systems, networks, or other proprietary information, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or could otherwise lead to the disruption of our business operations. Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period and could lead to disruptions in critical systems or the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information. These events could lead to financial loss from remedial actions, loss of business, disruption of operations, damage to our reputation or potential liability. Also, computers control nearly all the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States and abroad, which are necessary to transportation our production to market. A cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Cyber incidents have increased, and the United States government has issued warnings indicating that energy assets may be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. Further, as cyberattacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyberattacks.\nB18.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against oil and natural gas companies.\nOpposition toward oil and natural gas companies has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as drilling and development. Any restrictions or limitations on our business or operations resulting from such opposition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nB19.\nAn outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business will be dependent upon the willingness and ability of our customers to conduct transactions. The spread of a highly infectious or contagious disease, such as COVID-19, could cause severe disruptions in the worldwide economy, which could in turn disrupt our business, activities, and operations, as well as that of our customers. Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, may result in a significant decrease in business and/or cause customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations. A spread of COVID-19, or an outbreak of another contagious disease, could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business. Such a spread or outbreak could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party providers who perform critical services for our business. If COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, spreads or the response to contain COVID-19 is unsuccessful, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRemainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nC.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nC1.\nRefining margins, which are affected by commodity prices and refined product demand, are volatile, and a reduction in refining margins will adversely affect the amount of cash we will have available for working capital.\nHistorically, refining margins have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship between our crude oil and condensate acquisition costs, the prices at which we ultimately sell our refined products, and the volume of refined products that we sell, all of which depend upon numerous factors beyond our control. The prices at which we sell our refined products are strongly influenced by the commodity price of crude oil. If crude oil prices increase, our \u2018refinery operations\u2019 business segment margins will fall unless we can pass along these price increases to our wholesale customers. Increases in the selling prices for refined products typically trail the rising cost of crude oil and may be difficult to implement when crude oil costs increase dramatically over a short period. Sharp decreases in refined product market demand, such as the record low demand that has occurred because of widespread COVID-19 related travel restrictions, can adversely affect our refining margins.\nC2.\nThe price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products, and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity.\nOur refining earnings, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil and condensate that are processed and blended into refined products) at which we can sell refined products. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business. To improve margins, it is important for a crude oil refinery to maximize the yields of high value finished petroleum produces and to minimize the costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. When the margin between refined product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs decreases, our margins are negatively affected. Crude oil refining margins have historically been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, because of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products, and fuel and utility services. Although an increase or decrease in the price for crude oil generally results in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products, typically there is a time lag between the comparable increase or decrease in prices for refined products. The effect of changes in crude oil and condensate prices on our refining margins therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes.\nPrices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined products. Such supply and demand are affected by, among other things:\n\u25cf\nchanges in foreign, domestic, and local economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nforeign and domestic demand for fuel products;\n\u25cf\nworldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions;\n\u25cf\nforeign and domestic production levels of crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined products and the volume of crude oil, feedstocks, and refined products imported into the U.S.;\n\u25cf\navailability of and access to transportation infrastructure;\n\u25cf\ncapacity utilization rates of refineries in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 influence on oil prices;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment and marketing of alternative and competing fuels;\n\u25cf\ncommodities speculation;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters (such as hurricanes and tornadoes), accidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather, or other events that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries;\n\u25cf\nfederal and state governmental regulations and taxes; and\n\u25cf\nlocal factors, including market conditions, weather, and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets.\nC3.\nOur future success depends on our ability to acquire sufficient levels of crude oil on favorable terms to operate the Nixon refinery.\nOperation of the Nixon refinery depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate. Although we have no crude oil reserves and are not engaged in the exploration or production of crude oil, we believe that will be able to obtain adequate crude oil and other feedstocks at generally competitive prices for the foreseeable future. We have a long-term crude supply agreement in place with Pilot. In April 2020, the crude supply agreement renewed on a one-year evergreen basis. Pilot may terminate the crude supply agreement at any time by providing us 60 days prior written notice. We may terminate the agreement at any time during a renewal term by giving Pilot 60 days prior written notice.\nPilot also stores crude oil at the Nixon facility under a terminal services agreement Under the terminal services agreement, Pilot stores crude oil at the Nixon facility at a specified rate per bbl of the storage tank\u2019s shell capacity. In April 2020, the terminal services agreement renewed on a one-year evergreen basis. Either party may terminate the terminal services agreement by providing the other party 60 days prior written notice. The terminal services agreement will automatically terminate upon expiration or termination of the crude supply agreement.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nOur financial health could be adversely affected by defaults under our secured loan agreements, margin deterioration and volatility, and historic net losses and working capital deficits, which could impact our ability to acquire crude oil and condensate. A failure to acquire crude oil and condensate when needed will have a material effect on our business results and operations. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, our refinery experienced downtime as a result of lack of crude due to cash constraints.\nC4.\nDowntime at the Nixon refinery could result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense, increased inventory, and a reduction in cash available for payment of our obligations.\nThe Nixon refinery periodically experiences planned and unplanned temporary shutdowns. Unplanned shutdowns can occur for a variety of reasons, including voluntary regulatory compliance measures, cessation or suspension by regulatory authorities, disabled equipment, or lack of crude due to cash constraints. However, in Texas the most typically reason is excessive heat or power outages from high winds and thunderstorms. The Nixon refinery did not incur significant damage related to freezing temperatures in February 2021. However, the plant was down for approximately 8 days as a result of lost external power. Planned turnarounds are used to repair, restore, refurbish, or replace refinery equipment. Refineries typically undergo a major turnaround every three to five years. Since the Nixon refinery is still in the recommissioning phase, turnarounds are needed more frequently for unanticipated maintenance or repairs.\nWe are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our operations because all our refining operations are conducted at a single facility. Refinery downtime in 2020 totaled 42 days compared to 21 days in 2019. Refinery downtime in 2020 primarily related to lack of crude due to cash restraints, a maintenance turnaround, and equipment repairs while refinery downtime in 2019 primarily related to a maintenance turnaround and equipment repairs. Significant refinery downtime in 2020 negatively impacted refinery throughput, refinery production, and capacity utilization rate. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime will result in lost margin opportunity, potential increased maintenance expense, and a reduction of refined products inventory, which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nC5.\nWe may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate. Further, Affiliates may, but are not required to, fund our working capital requirements in the event our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity are inadequate.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or pursue our business strategies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. We currently rely on revenue from operations, including sales of refined products and rental of petroleum storage tanks, and Affiliates to meet our liquidity needs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accounts payable, related party totaled $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, long-term debt and accrued interest, related party combined totaled $18.5 million and $8.2 million, respectively.\nIn the event our working capital requirements are inadequate, or we are otherwise unable to secure sufficient liquidity to support our short term and/or long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards, or pursue our business strategies, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to acquisition of crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon refinery, repayment of debt obligations, and capital expenditures for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment of equipment at the Nixon facility. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy all these needs.\nC6.\nOur business may suffer if any of the executive officers or other key personnel discontinue employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain productivity.\nOur future success depends on the services of the executive officers and other key personnel and on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas of our operations. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced personnel with proficiency in multiple tasks. Competition for skilled personnel with industry-specific experience is intense, and the loss of these executives or personnel could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nC7.\nLoss of business from, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, one or more of our significant customers, one of which is an Affiliate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nWe have bulk term contracts in place with most of our customers, including month-to-month, six months, and up to one-year terms. Certain of our contracts require our customers to prepay and us to sell fixed quantities and/or minimum quantities of finished and intermediate petroleum products. Many of these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation on a forward-looking basis, which could result in higher or lower relative prices on future sales of our refined products.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nOur customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from. As a result, they can make substantial demands on us, including demands for more favorable product pricing or contractual terms. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. Our operating results could be harmed if a key customer is lost, reduces their order quantity, requires us to reduce our prices, is acquired by a competitor, or suffers financial hardship. Additionally, our profitability could be adversely affected if there is consolidation among our customer base and our customers command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale. We could decide not to sell our refined products to a certain customer if, because of increased leverage, the customer pressures us to reduce our pricing such that our gross profits are diminished, which could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors, and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results. Loss of business from, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, one or more of our major customers could similarly affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nOne of our significant customers is an Affiliate. The Affiliate purchases our jet fuel under a Jet Fuel Sales Agreement and bids on jet fuel contracts under preferential pricing terms due to a HUBZone certification. The Affiliate accounted for 28.7% and 31.3% of total revenue from operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Affiliate represented approximately $0 and $1.4 million in accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts will be paid under normal business terms. Amounts outstanding relating to the Jet Fuel Sales Agreement can significantly vary period to period based on the timing of the related sales and payments received. Amounts we owed to LEH under various long-term debt, related-party agreements totaled $9.1 million and $6.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nC8.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the transportation of crude oil and condensate into and refined products out of our Nixon facility; if these third parties become unavailable to us, our ability to process crude oil and condensate and sell refined products to wholesale markets could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on trucks for the receipt of crude oil and condensate into and the sale of refined products out of our Nixon facility. Since we do not own or operate any of these trucks, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of the third-party trucking companies that we use, or the trucking industry in general, become unavailable to transport crude oil, condensate, and/or our refined products because of acts of God, accidents, government regulation, terrorism or other events, our revenue and net income would be materially and adversely affected.\nC9.\nOur suppliers source a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale and may experience interruptions of supply from that region.\nOur suppliers source a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale. Consequently, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of supply from that region caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, unavailability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, severe weather, plant closures for scheduled maintenance, or the interruption of oil or natural gas being transported from wells in that area.\nC10.\nOur refining operations and customers are primarily located within the Eagle Ford Shale and changes in the supply/demand balance in this region could result in lower refining margins.\nOur primary operating assets are in Nixon, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale, and we market our refined products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. Therefore, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Should the supply/demand balance shift in our region due to changes in the local economy, an increase in refining capacity or other reasons, resulting in supply in the PADD 3 (Gulf Coast) region to exceed demand, we would have to deliver refined products to customers outside of our current operating region and thus incur considerably higher transportation costs, resulting in lower refining margins.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nC11.\nSevere weather or other events affecting our facilities, or those of our vendors, suppliers, or customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in receiving, handling, storing, and transferring crude oil and petroleum products, including: damages to facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by severe weather (such as cold temperatures, hurricanes, floods, and other natural disasters) or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, mechanical or structural failures, explosions, fires, spills, or acts of terrorism) at our facilities or at third-party facilities on which our operations are dependent could result in severe damage or destruction to our assets or the temporary or permanent shut-down of our operations. If we are unable to operate, our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected.\nC12.\nRegulatory changes, as well as proposed measures that are reasonably likely to be enacted, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur significant costs or could result in a decrease in demand for our refined products, which could adversely affect our business.\nScientific studies have indicated that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can produce changes in climate with significant physical effects, including increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other extreme weather events that could affect our operations. Increased concern over the effects of climate change may also affect our customers\u2019 energy strategies, consumer consumption patterns, and government and private sector alternative energy initiatives, any of which could adversely affect demand for petroleum products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBoth houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to: (i) establish a Cap-and-Trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or \u201cclean\u201d energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in energy supply and use. In addition, the EPA is taking steps to regulate greenhouse gases under the existing federal CAA. The EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources, including refineries. Various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken steps to control greenhouse gas emissions, including adoption of greenhouse gas reporting requirements, Cap-and-Trade systems, and renewable portfolio standards. This has also been a focus of the Biden Administration in its first few months. These and similar regulations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations.\nRequirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain the Nixon facility as well as implement and manage new emission controls and programs. For example, some states have passed regulations, such as Cap-and-Trade and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions below set targets by 2030 and beyond. Cap-and-Trade places a cap on greenhouse gases and refiners are required to acquire a sufficient number of credits to cover emissions from their refinery and in-state sales of gasoline and diesel. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard requires an established percentage reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel by a specified time period. Compliance with the Low Carbon Fuel Standard is achieved through blending lower carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits. Compliance with each of these programs is facilitated through a market-based credit system. If sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase or refiners are unable to pass through costs to their customers, they must pay a higher price for credits. It is currently uncertain how the current presidential administration or future administrations will address greenhouse gas emissions. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions, we may not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Regulatory requirements also could adversely affect demand for the refined petroleum products that we produce. Any increased costs or reduced demand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nC13.\nWe may not be successful in integrating or pursuing acquisitions in the future.\nAlthough we regularly engage in discussions with, and submit proposals to, acquisition candidates, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. Even if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition, or, if the acquisition occurs, effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing businesses. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations may require a disproportionate amount of management\u2019s attention and our resources. Even if we complete additional acquisitions, continued acquisition financing may not be available or available on reasonable terms, any new businesses may not generate the anticipated level of revenues, the anticipated cost efficiencies, or synergies may not be realized, and these businesses may not be integrated successfully or operated profitably. Our inability to successfully identify, execute, or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results of operations.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nD.\nRisks Related to Pipeline and Facilities Assets, as well as our Pipelines and Oil and Gas Properties\nD1.\nAssessment of civil penalties by BOEM for our failure to satisfy orders to provide additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bonds) within the time period prescribed.\nTo cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, BOEM evaluates an operator\u2019s financial ability to carry out present and future obligations to determine whether the operator must provide additional security beyond the statutory bonding requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning pipelines and platforms at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by BOEM.\nBDPL has historically maintained $0.9 million in financial assurance to BOEM for the decommissioning of its trunk pipeline offshore in federal waters. Following an agency restructuring of the financial assurance program, in March 2018 BOEM ordered BDPL to provide additional financial assurance totaling approximately $4.8 million for five (5) existing pipeline rights-of-way within sixty (60) calendar days. In June 2018, BOEM issued BDPL INCs for each right-of-way that failed to comply. BDPL appealed the INCs to the IBLA, and the IBLA granted multiple extension requests that extended BDPL\u2019s deadline for filing a statement of reasons for the appeal with the IBLA. On August 9, 2019, BDPL timely filed its statement of reasons for the appeal with the IBLA. Considering BDPL\u2019s August 2019 meeting with BOEM and BSEE, BDPL requested a stay in the IBLA matter until August 2020. The Office of the Solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior was agreeable to a 10-day extension while it conferred with BOEM on BDPL\u2019s stay request. In late October 2019, BDPL filed a motion to request the 10-day extension, which motion was subsequently granted by the IBLA. The solicitor\u2019s office consented to an additional 14-day extension for BDPL to file its reply, and BDPL filed a motion to request the 14-day extension in November 2019. The solicitor\u2019s office indicated that BOEM would not consent to further extensions. However, the solicitor\u2019s office signaled that BDPL\u2019s adherence to the milestones identified in an August 15, 2019 meeting between management and BSEE may help in future discussions with BOEM related to the INCs. Decommissioning of these assets will significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of financial assurance required by BOEM, which may serve to partially or fully resolve the INCs. Although we planned to decommission the offshore pipelines and platform assets in the third quarter of 2020, decommissioning of these assets has been delayed due to cash constraints associated with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and winter being the offseason for dive operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We cannot currently estimate when decommissioning may occur. In the interim, BDPL provides BOEM and BSEE with updates regarding the project\u2019s status.\nBDPL\u2019s pending appeal of the BOEM INCs does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to provide additional financial assurance or of BOEM\u2019s authority to impose financial penalties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bond) requirements. If BDPL is required by BOEM to provide significant additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bonds) or is assessed significant penalties under the INCs, we will experience a significant and material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nWe are currently unable to predict the outcome of the BOEM INCs. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, BDPL maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed pipeline rights-of-way bonds issued to BOEM.\nD2.\nAssessment of civil penalties by BSEE for our failure to decommission pipeline and platform assets within the time periods prescribed.\nBDPL has pipelines and platform assets that are subject to BSEE\u2019s idle iron regulations. Idle iron regulations mandate lessees and rights-of-way holders to permanently abandon and/or remove platforms and other structures when they are no longer useful for operations. Until such structures are abandoned or removed, lessees and rights-of-way holders are required to inspect and maintain the assets in accordance with regulatory requirements.\nIn December 2018, BSEE issued an INC to BDPL for failure to flush and fill Pipeline Segment No. 13101. Management met with BSEE on August 15, 2019 to address BDPL\u2019s plans with respect to decommissioning its offshore pipelines and platform assets. BSEE proposed that BDPL re-submit permit applications for pipeline and platform decommissioning, along with a safe boarding plan for the platform, within six (6) months (no later than February 15, 2020), and develop and implement a safe boarding plan for submission with such permit applications. Further, BSEE proposed that BDPL complete approved, permitted work within twelve (12) months (no later than August 15, 2020). BDPL timely submitted permit applications for decommissioning of the subject offshore pipelines and platform assets to BSEE on February 11, 2020 and the USACOE on March 25, 2020. In April 2020, BSEE issued another INC to BDPL for failure to perform the required structural surveys for the GA-288C Platform. BDPL requested an extension to the INC related to the structural platform surveys, and BSEE approved BDPL\u2019s extension request. The required platform surveys were completed, and the INC was resolved in June 2020. Although we planned to decommission the offshore pipelines and platform assets in the third quarter of 2020, decommissioning of these assets has been delayed due to cash constraints associated with the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and winter being the offseason for dive operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We cannot currently estimate when decommissioning may occur. In the interim, BDPL provides BSEE with updates regarding the project\u2019s status.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nLack of permit approvals does not relieve BDPL of its obligations to remedy the BSEE INCs or of BSEE\u2019s authority to impose financial penalties. If BDPL fails to complete decommissioning of the offshore pipelines and platform assets and/or remedy the INCs within a timeframe determined to be prudent by BSEE, BDPL could be subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement, including but not limited to failure to correct an INC, civil penalties, and revocation of BDPL\u2019s operator designation, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe are currently unable to predict the outcome of the BSEE INCs. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, BDPL maintained $2.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in AROs related to abandonment of these assets.\nE.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nE1.\nOur stock price has experienced price fluctuations and may continue to do so, resulting in a substantial loss in your investment.\nThe market for our common stock has been characterized by volatile prices. As a result, investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly unpredictable and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nQuarterly variations in our operating results and achievement of key business metrics.\n\u25cf\nChanges in the global economy and the local economies in which we operate.\n\u25cf\nOur ability to obtain working capital financing.\n\u25cf\nChanges in the federal, state, and local laws and regulations to which we are subject.\n\u25cf\nMarket reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors.\n\u25cf\nThe departure of any of our key executive officers and directors.\n\u25cf\nFuture sales of our securities.\nE2.\nOur stock price may decline due to sales of shares by Affiliates.\nAffiliates sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future. Affiliates could elect in the future to request that we file a registration statement to them to sell shares of our Common Stock. If Affiliates were to sell a large number of shares into the public markets, Affiliates could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nE3.\nWe are authorized to issue up to a total of 20 million shares of our Common Stock and 2.5 million shares of preferred stock; issuance of additional shares would further dilute the equity ownership of current holders and potentially dilute the share price of our Common Stock.\nWe periodically issue Common Stock to non-employee directors for services rendered to the Board and to Jonathan Carroll pursuant to the Guaranty Fee Agreements. In the past, we have also issued Common Stock, Preferred Stock, convertible securities (such as convertible notes), and warrants in order to raise capital. We believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock to provide us with the flexibility to issue Common Stock or Preferred Stock for business purposes that may arise as deemed advisable by our Board. These purposes could include, among other things, (i) future stock splits, which may increase the liquidity of our shares; (ii) the sale of stock to obtain additional capital or to acquire other companies or businesses, which could enhance our growth strategy or allow us to reduce debt if needed; and (iii) for other bona fide purposes. Our Board may authorize us to issue the available authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock without notice to, or further action by, our stockholders, unless stockholder approval is required by law or the rules of the OTCQX.\nThe issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or new shares of Preferred Stock, convertible securities, and/or warrants may significantly dilute the equity ownership of the current holders of our Common Stock, affect the rights of our stockholders, or could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, the issuance or sale of large amounts of our Common Stock, or the potential for issuance or sale even if they do not actually occur, may have the effect of depressing the market price of our Common Stock.\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage\nE4.\nShares eligible for future sale pursuant to Rule 144 may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of Common Stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, stockholders who have been non-affiliates for the preceding three months may sell shares of our Common Stock freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell shares of our Common Stock after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale, current public information, and notice requirements. Any substantial sales of our Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nE5.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore investors should not anticipate cash dividends on their investment.\nUnder certain of our secured loan agreements, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend on our Common Stock without the prior written consent of the lender. We have historically not declared any dividends on our Common Stock and there can be no assurance that cash dividends will ever be paid on our common stock.\nE6.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting.\nThere are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. An effective control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met. Accordingly, management does not expect that the control system can prevent or detect all errors or fraud. Further, projections of any evaluation or assessment of effectiveness of a control system to future periods are subject to the risks that, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in an entity\u2019s operating environment or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nManagement\u2019s evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 determined they were ineffective. There is currently not a process in place for formal review of manual journal entries. In addition, we currently lack resources to handle complex accounting transactions. This can result in errors related to the recording, disclosure, and presentation of consolidated financial information in quarterly, annual, and other filings. Prior year audit procedures resulted in significant adjustments related to the accounting for a certain stock issuance in payment of related party debt, as well as deferred revenue relating to consideration received from a supplier. Management has taken steps to address these matters, however, efforts have been affected by remote work arrangements, reduced personnel, business disruption, and a diversion of resources due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot at this time estimate how long it will take to fully remedy the identified weakness and deficiency, and our initiatives may not prove to be successful in fully remediating the identified weakness and deficiency. Full remediation requires one or more additional period-end financial reporting periods to evaluate effectiveness. Because we are unable to resolve internal control deficiencies in a timely manner, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nRemainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank\nBlue Dolphin Energy Company\nDecember 31,\nPage", "PERMNO": 76310, "SIC": 4922, "TIC": "BDCO"}
