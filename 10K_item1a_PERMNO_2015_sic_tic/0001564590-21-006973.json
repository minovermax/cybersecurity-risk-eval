{"cik": "1171825", "company": "CIT GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe operation of our business, and the economic and regulatory climate in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business involve various elements of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before deciding whether to invest in the Company. This is a discussion of the risks that we believe are material to our business and does not include all risks, material or immaterial, that may possibly affect our business. Any of the following risks, and additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMerger-Related Risks\nFailure to complete the merger with First Citizens could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nIf our pending merger with First Citizens is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative effects on our stock price\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from our customers and vendors\n\u2022\nwe will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, including legal, accounting, and other fees, whether or not the merger is completed\n\u2022\nour management team will have devoted substantial time and resources to matters relating to the merger, and would otherwise have devoted their time and resources to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to CIT, which could cause CIT to lag competitor advances.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and CIT seeks another merger or business combination, the market price of our common stock could decline, which could make it more difficult to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration First Citizens has agreed to provide in the merger.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nWe will be subject to uncertainties while our merger with First Citizens is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers and others that transact business with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the surviving corporation following the merger.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated and our merger with First Citizens may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and the requisite approvals of CIT\u2019s and First Citizens\u2019 stockholders (which stockholder approvals were obtained on February 9, 2021). Conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, we and/or First Citizens may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances.\nOur ability to complete our pending merger with First Citizens is subject to various regulatory approvals, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us.\nBefore our pending merger with First Citizens may be completed, we must obtain federal and state regulatory approvals, including approval of the FRB, the FDIC, and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the merger, and any such conditions could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or causing a termination of the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be received, the timing of that approval, or whether any conditions will be imposed.\nShareholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of our pending merger with First Citizens or otherwise negatively affect our business and operations.\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with our pending merger with First Citizens. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger.\nBecause the market price of First Citizens\u2019 common stock may fluctuate, our stockholders cannot be certain of the precise value of the merger consideration they may receive in our pending merger with First Citizens.\nAt the time our pending merger with First Citizens is completed, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock (other than certain shares held by us or First Citizens) will be converted into the right to receive 0.062 shares of First Citizens\u2019 class A common stock. There will be a time lapse between each of the date of the proxy statement/prospectus for the stockholders\u2019 meeting to approve the merger, the date on which our stockholders vote to approve the merger, and the date on which our stockholders are entitled to receive shares of First Citizens\u2019 common stock actually receive such shares. The market value of First Citizens\u2019 common stock may fluctuate during these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in First Citizens\u2019 businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of our and First Citizens\u2019 control. The actual value of the shares of First Citizens\u2019 common stock received by our shareholders will depend on the market value of shares of First Citizens\u2019 common stock at the time the merger is completed. This market value may be less or more than the value used to determine the exchange ratio stated in the Merger Agreement.\nStrategic Risks\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness and acceptance of any vaccines, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nAlthough financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic and global economic conditions showed some improvement during the second half of 2020, many of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted at the end of the year, including (i) sudden and significant declines, and significant increases in volatility, in financial markets; (ii) ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, including transportation, natural resources, retail, hospitality and commercial real estate; (iii) customers drawing on credit lines to increase liquidity; (iv) the federal funds rate and yields on U.S. Treasury securities near zero; and (v) heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements. In addition, many of our customers, counterparties and third-party service providers have been, and may further be, affected by \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, market volatility, supply chain disruption, and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to repay loans, perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide other essential services. As a result, our credit, operational and other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.\nAlthough we have a business continuity plan that is designed to provide for our continuing operation in case of potentially disruptive events, such as a global pandemic, there can be no guarantee that our plan will continue to effectively address some or all of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business operations may be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, or if we are unable to maintain service in our branches, lockboxes, or other operations that cannot be operated remotely.\nDepending on the duration and severity of the pandemic going forward, the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and these or other adverse developments may occur or reoccur. We continue to monitor the sectors that are most susceptible to economic uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for goods and service for many of our customers and other businesses in sectors that we service. In the retail sector, our exposure is primarily in the factoring business, principally in trade receivables, and to a lesser extent in the commercial real estate business. In the hospitality and transportation sectors, we have loan exposures to the restaurant, lodging, gaming, maritime, aviation and rail industries. The significant declines in the price of, and demand for, oil and gas may have negative effects on not only our loan exposures in the exploration and production sector, but may also lead to a decreased demand for our railcars, and could have a significant adverse effect on the demand for ships that are collateral for our loans. Further, we have exposure to small businesses through both equipment loans and leases and through SBA loans, which could be adversely affected by the extensive closure of businesses in many states during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have exposure to single family residential mortgages, which could be adversely affected by job losses due to the economic dislocation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we have implemented several forms of temporary relief to our consumer and commercial customers, including payment deferrals, suspension of foreclosures and evictions, and fee waivers for ATM transactions, overdrafts, and early withdrawal of certificates of deposit, which may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations or result in higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periods.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and market conditions have increased demands on credit facilities that we provide to our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. In addition, these adverse developments may negatively affect our capital and leverage ratios. We previously announced that we were suspending repurchases of our common stock in connection with our acquisition of Mutual of Omaha Bank until our target 10.5% CET1 capital ratio was reached, which we originally projected to occur by the end of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our ability to reach the 10.5% target by the end of 2020, and, even if that target is reached at a later date, may cause us to continue suspension of repurchases or further reduce capital distributions to preserve capital and liquidity to meet our customers\u2019 needs. Long-term adverse effects could also prevent us from satisfying minimum regulatory capital ratios. Further, although we continue to monitor our capital and liquidity, including through stress testing, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to accurately predict our future capital and liquidity needs.\nIn addition to the potential impact on industries that we serve, we are also potentially impacted by increased cybersecurity attacks. In times of economic stress, there are typically increased attempts at cybersecurity attacks to exploit potential weaknesses. For example, there currently are increased attempts at phishing attacks, in which attackers pose as known persons or authorities to entice employees to reveal their network credentials. Although we have significant resources dedicated to cybersecurity, there is no guarantee that we will not fall victim to phishing attacks or other cybersecurity attacks, which could lead to unauthorized access to confidential customer information or disruption of our technology and systems.\nFurther, like most organizations, we are susceptible to key man risk, meaning the risk that key members of our executive management team, such as our Chairwoman and CEO, our CFO, the leaders of our two operating segments, our Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Credit Officer, or our Chief Technology and Operations Officer become ill or are incapacitated. Although we have management succession plans in place, there is no guarantee that those plans will be successfully implemented or will succeed.\nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken unprecedented measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown, and they may not be sufficient to address the negative effects of COVID-19 or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity.\nThe length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown. Other negative effects of COVID-19 that may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations cannot be predicted at this time. It is likely, however, that our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected until the pandemic subsides. Until the pandemic subsides, we may experience increased draws on lines of credit, reduced revenues in certain commercial business lines and increased credit losses in our lending portfolios. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy as well as most other major economies may struggle to reopen their economies and may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged or double-dip recession in the U.S. and other major markets.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nIf the assumptions and analyses underlying our strategy and business plan are incorrect, including with respect to market conditions, capital and liquidity, business strategy, and operations, we may be unsuccessful in executing our strategy and business plan.\nA number of strategic issues affect our business, including how we allocate our capital and liquidity, our business strategy, our funding models, and the quality and efficiency of operations. We developed our strategy and business plan based upon certain assumptions, analyses, and financial forecasts, including with respect to our capital levels, credit ratings, revenue growth, earnings, interest margins, expense levels, cash flow, credit losses, liquidity and financing sources, lines of business and geographic scope, acquisitions and divestitures, equipment residual values, capital expenditures, retention of key employees, and the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions. Financial forecasts are inherently subject to many uncertainties and are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. Accordingly, our actual financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from what we have forecast, and we may not be able to reach our goals and targets. If we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives effectively, we may need to refine, supplement, or modify our business plan and strategy in significant ways. If we are unable to fully implement our business plan and strategy, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from buying or selling a business or assets, or entering into a new business initiative, which may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nAs part of our strategy and business plan, we may consider buying or selling a business or assets in order to manage our business, the products and services we offer, our asset levels, credit exposures, or liquidity position. There are a number of risks inherent in purchase and sale transactions, including the risk that we fail to identify or acquire key businesses or assets, that we fail to complete a pending transaction, that we fail to sell a business or assets that are considered non-strategic or high risk, that we overpay for an acquisition or receive inadequate consideration for a disposition, or that we fail to properly integrate an acquired company or to realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction. We acquired MOB on January 1, 2020, and we sold (i) NACCO SAS, our European rail car leasing business in October 2018, and (ii) our Financial Freedom servicing business, including our reverse mortgage portfolio, in May 2018.\nIn engaging in business acquisitions, CIT may decide to pay a premium over book and market values to complete the transaction, which may result in dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share. If CIT uses substantial cash or other liquid assets or incurs substantial debt to acquire a business or assets, we could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nIntegrating the operations of an acquired entity can be difficult. As a result, CIT may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. If we fail to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product scope, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition, or if we are unable to adequately integrate the acquired business, or experience unexpected costs, changes in our risk profile, or disruption to our business, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhen we sell a business or assets, the agreement between the Company and the buyer typically contains representations and warranties, including with regard to the conduct of the business, the servicing practices, and compliance with laws and regulations, among others, and the agreement typically contains certain indemnifications to allocate risks among the parties and may be subject to certain caps and limitations. CIT may also retain certain pre-closing liabilities, including the cost of legacy and future litigation matters related to pre-closing actions. The terms of any agreement, including any representations and warranties, indemnifications or retained liabilities, may subject us to ongoing risks after the sale is completed and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, as part of its ongoing business, CIT from time to time enters into new business initiatives, and from time to time has targeted certain expense reductions in its business. The new business initiatives may not be successful in increasing revenue, whether due to significant levels of competition, lack of demand for services, lack of name recognition or a record of prior performance, or otherwise, or may require higher expenditures than anticipated to generate new business volume. The expense initiatives may not reduce expenses as much as anticipated, whether due to delays in implementation, higher than expected or unanticipated costs of implementation, increased costs for new regulatory obligations, or for other reasons. If CIT is unable to achieve the anticipated revenue growth from its new business initiatives or the projected expense reductions from efficiency improvements, its results of operations and profitability may be adversely affected.\nCompetition from both traditional competitors and new market entrants may adversely affect our market share, profitability, and returns.\nOur markets are highly competitive and are characterized by competitive factors that vary based upon product and geographic region. We have a wide variety of competitors that include captive and independent finance companies, commercial banks and thrift institutions, industrial banks, community banks, internet banks, leasing companies, hedge funds, business development companies, insurance companies, mortgage companies, manufacturers and vendors. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulation we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial service companies (or fintechs) have grown significantly over recent years and are expected to continue growing.\nWe compete on the basis of pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits and the pricing for equipment leases), product terms and structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology in the delivery of products and services to our customers is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nindustry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction.\nIf we are unable to address the competitive pressures that we face, we could lose market share, which could result in reduced net finance revenue and profitability and lower returns. On the other hand, if we meet those competitive pressures, it is possible that we could incur significant additional expense, experience lower returns due to compressed net finance revenue, or incur increased losses due to less rigorous risk standards.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nIf we fail to maintain sufficient capital or adequate liquidity to meet regulatory capital requirements or supervisory expectations, there could be an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAs a banking organization, CIT\u2019s capital and liquidity are subject to regulation and supervision by banking regulators. Although the enhanced prudential supervision requirements imposed on large BHCs under the Tailoring Rules do not apply to CIT, the banking regulators, pursuant to their regular supervisory process, could require CIT to maintain more and higher quality capital than previously. The banking regulators could also require CIT to hold higher levels of liquidity or high-quality liquid assets (\u201cHQLA\u201d), thereby limiting our ability to invest in longer-term other assets at higher yields. If we fail to maintain the appropriate capital levels or adequate liquidity, we could become subject to a variety of formal or informal enforcement actions, which may include restrictions on our business activities, including limiting lending and leasing activities, limiting the expansion of our business, either organically or through acquisitions, limiting our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or requiring the raising of additional capital, which may be dilutive to shareholders. If we are unable to maintain sufficient capital or adequate liquidity, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility also includes terms that require us to comply with regulatory capital requirements and maintain a Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio of at least 9.0%. If we are unable to satisfy these or any of the other relevant terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to terminate the Revolving Credit Facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. In such event, unless we can refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the Revolving Credit Facility, we may not have adequate liquidity for our business needs, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate liquidity or to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our obligations as they come due, whether due to a downgrade in our credit ratings or for any other reasons, it could adversely affect our future business operations.\nCIT\u2019s liquidity is essential for the operation of our business. Our liquidity, and our ability to fund our activities through bank deposits or wholesale funding markets, could be affected by a number of factors, including market conditions, our capital structure and capital levels, our credit ratings, and the performance of our business. An adverse change in any of those factors, and particularly a downgrade in our credit ratings, could negatively affect CIT\u2019s liquidity and competitive position, increase our funding costs, or limit our access to the deposit markets or wholesale funding markets. Further, an adverse change in the performance of our business could have a negative impact on our operating cash flow. Our liquidity may also be impaired by unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such as occurred during the first quarter of 2020 when corporate customers drew on revolving credit facilities at a historic pace in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CIT\u2019s credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, which consider a number of factors, including CIT\u2019s own financial strength, performance, prospects, and operations, as well as factors not within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. See the \"Funding and Liquidity - Debt Ratings\" section of the MD&A for additional discussion of CIT\u2019s credit ratings. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current ratings, some of which are below investment grade at the holding company level. If we experience a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity, or fail to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our obligations, either as a result of a downgrade in our credit ratings or for any other reason, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully expand our deposits at CIT Bank or if our aggregate amount of deposits decreases.\nCIT Bank currently has a retail branch network and an on-line bank, which offer a variety of deposit products to retail customers. CIT Bank also offers a range of deposit products to commercial clients. Our ability to raise deposits and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is dependent on CIT Bank's capital levels, the size of its branch network, the quality and scope of its online banking platform, and its ability to attract lower cost demand deposits. Federal banking law generally prohibits a bank from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits, unless the bank is well-capitalized, or it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the FDIC. There are also restrictions on interest rates that may be paid by banks that are less than well capitalized, under which such a bank generally may not pay an interest rate on any deposit of more than 75 basis points over the national rate published by the FDIC, unless the FDIC determines that the bank is operating in a high-rate area. We are likely to face significant competition for deposits from larger BHCs who are similarly seeking larger and more stable pools of funding and from new entrants to online banking. If CIT Bank fails to expand and diversify its deposit-taking capability, or if CIT Bank's aggregate amount of deposits decreases due to economic uncertainty, a migration of deposits to the largest banks, or for other reasons, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be restricted from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.\nCIT Group Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, including CIT Bank, and relies on interest and dividends from its subsidiaries for a significant portion of its cash flow. Federal banking laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that CIT Bank can pay to CIT Group Inc. At CIT Group Inc., routine payment of dividends from earnings that can be\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nsustained on a recurring basis would not typically require consultation with the regulators. However, regulatory guidance states that a BHC should consult with regulators in circumstances where the declaration and payment of a dividend could raise concerns about the safe and sound operation of the BHC and its depository institution subsidiaries, where the dividend declared for a period is not supported by earnings for that period, and where a BHC plans to declare a material increase in its common stock dividend. In certain circumstances, CIT Group Inc.\u2019s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under the regulations or policies of the FRB.\nCredit and Asset Risks\nOur allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate.\nThe quality of our loans and leases depends on the creditworthiness of our customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us, and the value of the underlying collateral. We maintain a consolidated allowance for credit losses on our loans to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. The amount of our allowance reflects management's judgment of current expected credit losses over the life of the portfolio. However, the economic environment is dynamic, and our portfolio credit quality could decline in the future.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not keep pace with changes in the credit-worthiness of our customers or in collateral values. If the credit quality of our customer base declines, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes significantly, if we are unable to collect the full amount on equipment, real estate, or accounts receivable taken as collateral, or if the value of equipment, real estate, or other collateral deteriorates significantly, our allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by the actions and changes in the commercial soundness of other financial institutions.\nCIT\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and changes in the commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of syndications, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. CIT has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, vendors, and other institutional clients. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could affect market liquidity and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose CIT to credit risk in the event of default by its counterparty or client. In addition, CIT\u2019s credit risk may be impacted if the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to CIT. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect CIT, possibly materially.\nOur Rail business is concentrated by industry and our retail banking business is concentrated geographically, and any downturn in the rail industry or in the geographic area of our retail banking business may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our business is diversified by customer, industry, and geography. However, although our Rail business is diversified by customer and geography, it is concentrated in one industry. If there is a significant downturn in shipping by railcar, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA majority of CIT Bank\u2019s retail branch network and a majority of its consumer mortgage loans are located in Southern California. Although our other businesses are national in scope, these other businesses also have a significant presence within the Southern California geographic market. Adverse conditions in the Southern California geographic market, such as inflation, unemployment, recession, market disruption, natural or man-made disasters, or other factors beyond our control, could impact the ability of borrowers in Southern California to repay their loans, decrease the value of the collateral securing loans in Southern California, or affect the ability of our customers in Southern California to continue conducting business with us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to realize our entire investment in the equipment we lease to our customers.\nOur loans and leases include a significant portion of leased equipment, including but not limited to railcars and locomotives, technology and office equipment, and medical equipment. The realization of equipment values (residual values) during the life and at the end of the term of a lease is an important element in the profitability of our leasing business. At the inception of each lease, we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the end of the lease term or end of the equipment\u2019s estimated useful life.\nIf the market value of leased equipment decreases at a rate greater than we projected, whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence, unusual wear and tear on the equipment, excessive use of the equipment, recession or other adverse economic conditions, it could adversely affect the current values or the residual values of such equipment. For example, as the price of or demand for crude oil, coal, or other commodities goes up or down, whether due to changes in production levels, general economic conditions, concerns over climate change, or other reasons, it may affect the demand for railcars used to ship such commodities and the lease rates for such railcars, which could affect the residual values of such railcars. Further, if certain commodities cause more wear and tear on railcars, such as increased corrosion, it may increase maintenance and repair costs, which could affect the residual values of such railcars.\nCertain equipment residual values, including railcar residuals, are dependent on the manufacturers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 warranties, reputation, and other factors, including demand and market conditions and liquidity. Residual values for certain equipment, including rail and medical equipment, may also be affected by changes in laws or regulations that mandate design changes or\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nadditional safety features. For example, regulations issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d) in the U.S. and Transport Canada (\u201cTC\u201d) in Canada in 2015, and supplemented by the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (\u201cFAST Act\u201d) in the U.S., require us to retrofit a significant portion of our tank cars over the next several years in order to continue leasing those tank cars for the transport of a flammable liquid. In addition, we may not realize the full market value of equipment if we are required to sell it to meet liquidity needs or for other reasons outside of the ordinary course of business. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will realize our estimated residual values for equipment.\nThe degree of residual realization risk varies by transaction type. Finance leases bear the least risk because contractual payments usually cover approximately 90% of the equipment's cost at the inception of the lease. Operating leases have a higher degree of risk because a smaller percentage of the equipment's value is covered by contractual cash flows over the term of the lease. A significant portion of our leasing portfolios are comprised of operating leases, which increase our residual realization risk.\nMarket Risks\nInvestment in and revenues in foreign jurisdictions are subject to various risks and requirements associated with transacting business in foreign countries.\nWe conduct limited business operations in certain foreign jurisdictions, and we engage in certain cross border lending and leasing transactions. An economic recession or downturn, increased competition, or business disruption associated with the political or regulatory environments in the international markets in which we do business could adversely affect us.\nIn addition, our limited foreign lending and leasing transactions are sometimes denominated in foreign currencies, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These exposures, if not effectively hedged, could have a material adverse effect on our investment in international loan and lease transactions and the level of international revenues that we generate from such transactions. Reported results from our foreign loan and lease transactions may fluctuate from period to period due to exchange rate movements in relation to the U.S. dollar.\nForeign countries have various compliance requirements for tax filings, which are required in order to obtain and maintain licenses to transact business and may be different in some respects from tax laws and regulations of the U.S. If we are unable to properly complete and file our tax filings, tax authorities in the applicable jurisdiction may restrict our ability to do business.\nFurthermore, both our domestic and international loan and lease transactions could expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. The U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trade sanction laws, anti-bribery rules under the FCPA and other federal statutes. Under trade sanction and anticorruption laws, the government may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities with sanctioned parties or in sanctioned countries, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to severe criminal and civil fines, penalties and other sanctions. If any of the risks described above materialize, it could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by significant changes in interest rates.\nWe rely on deposits, secured debt, and unsecured debt to fund our business. We derive the bulk of our income from net finance revenue, which is the difference between (i) interest and rental income on our loans and leases and interest expense on deposits and other borrowings, depreciation on our operating lease equipment and maintenance and other operating lease expenses. Prevailing economic conditions, the trade, fiscal, and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which in turn significantly affects our net finance revenue. Volatility in interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions.\nAny significant change in market interest rates may result in a change in net finance margin and net finance revenue. A substantial portion of our loans and other financing products, a portion of our investment portfolio, and a portion of our deposits and other borrowings, bear interest at floating interest rates. As interest rates increase, periodic interest obligations owed by our customers to us will also increase, as will our own interest expense. Demand for our loans or other financing products may decrease as interest rates rise or if interest rates are expected to rise in the future. In addition, if prevailing interest rates increase, some of our customers may not be able to make the increased interest payments or refinance their payment transactions, resulting in payment defaults and loan impairments. As interest rates rise, the yield on any floating rate securities in our investment portfolio will increase but the market value of securities with fixed-rate interest payments will fall. Conversely, if interest rates remain low, our interest expense may decrease, but our customers may refinance the loans they have with us at lower interest rates, or with others, leading to lower revenues. As interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate investment securities will rise but the yield on any floating-rate securities in our investment portfolio will fall. As interest rates rise and fall over time, any significant change in market rates may result in a change in net finance revenue, particularly if the interest rates we pay on our deposits and other borrowings and the interest rates we charge our customers do not change uniformly either due to timing or differences in reference rates, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the targeted Federal Funds rate to between zero and 0.25%. In addition, some foreign central banks have moved to a negative interest rate environment, which has exerted downward pressure on the profitability of banks in those regions. The Company\u2019s financial condition could be damaged if this interest rate trend\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nextends to the United States.\nReforms to and uncertainty regarding LIBOR and certain other indices may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. However, the administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and will cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in \u201cnew\u201d contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is not possible to know whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may have on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions, and the potential or actual discontinuance of benchmark quotes, may adversely affect the value of, return on and trading market for our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to benchmarks, including any LIBOR-based securities, loans and derivatives, or our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for an actual discontinuation of benchmarks, including LIBOR, that may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics (including, but not limited to, interest rates to be paid to or by us) and cause significant disruption to financial markets that are relevant to our business segments, particularly Commercial Banking, among other adverse consequences, which may result in negative impacts to our financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulators and industry groups have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and identified recommended alternatives for certain reference rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR). We continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments and have a transition program in place to manage the implementation of alternative reference rates. Though the usage of, methodologies for, and proposals around alternative reference rates continue to evolve, it is not possible at this time to predict what the ultimate acceptance will be and what the effect of this transition may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nCompliance, Regulatory and Legal Risks\nAlthough we are not subject to the enhanced prudential supervision requirements applicable to banking organizations over $100 billion in assets, we may still be adversely affected by the increased scrutiny applicable to large regional banking organizations.\nAs a BHC with total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion, CIT Group Inc. is not subject to the FRB\u2019s enhanced prudential standards. However, the FRB has stated that it will continue to supervise and regulate financial institutions to ensure the safety and soundness of individual institutions and the stability of the broader banking system, and the capital planning and risk management practices of financial institutions with assets of less than $100 billion, including CIT Group Inc., will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. CIT Group Inc. has dedicated significant time, effort, and expense over time to comply with regulatory and supervisory standards and requirements imposed by our regulators, either through rulemaking or the supervisory process, and we expect to continue to do so. If we fail to develop at a reasonable cost the systems and processes necessary to comply with the standards and requirements imposed by these rules, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to significant government regulation and supervision and we could be adversely affected by banking or other regulations, including new regulations or changes in existing regulations or the application thereof.\nThe financial services industry, in general, is heavily regulated. CIT is subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision of the FRB and CIT Bank is subject to supervision by the OCC, in each case including risk-based and leverage capital requirements, information reporting requirements, consumer protection laws and regulations, financial crimes monitoring, and others. Further, CIT Bank is subject to regulation in certain instances by the FDIC, due to its insured deposits, and the CFPB. This regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors, consumer borrowers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, and is not intended to protect debt and equity security holders. The financial condition and results of operations of a BHC (including its depository institution subsidiaries) that fails to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements and that has elected to be treated as an FHC, including maintaining its status as well managed and well capitalized and meeting the supervisory standards set by banking regulators, could be adversely affected, and the BHC may be restricted in its ability to undertake certain capital actions (such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares) or to engage in certain activities or acquisitions.\nThese laws and regulations may impose significant assessments on CIT. Because our deposits are insured by the FDIC, we are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally are unable to control the amount of our assessments, and we may be required to pay higher FDIC assessments in the future than we currently do if increases are required to meet the FDIC\u2019s designated reserve ratio, or if there is an increase in the number of bank failures. In addition, CIT could be required to pay risk-based assessments to the Orderly Liquidation Fund if there are future liquidations of systemically important BHCs or non-bank financial companies. Any increase in our FDIC insurance assessments or any assessments related to the Orderly Liquidation Fund could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. See the \u201cRegulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation - FDIC Deposit Insurance\u201d and \u201cRegulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation - Orderly Liquidation Authority\u201d sections of Item 1. Business Overview for additional discussion of FDIC deposit insurance and Orderly Liquidation Fund assessments.\nFurthermore, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have broad enforcement powers with respect to BHCs and insured depository institutions, such as CIT and CIT Bank, including the power to impose cease and desist orders and/or substantial fines and other penalties. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject CIT or CIT Bank, as well as their\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nofficers and directors, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties. Regulators also have broad authority to enforce AML and sanctions laws. Failure to comply with AML and sanctions laws or to maintain an adequate compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage, and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when considering approval of applications to acquire, merge, or consolidate with another banking institution, or to engage in other expansionary activities. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions by regulators, as well as state attorneys general and the Department of Justice, against banks, broker-dealers and non-bank financial institutions with respect to AML and sanctions laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including criminal pleas. Any violation of law or regulation, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations, could result in the fines, sanctions or other penalties described above, which could have significant reputational or other consequences and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the \u201cRegulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation\u201d section of Item 1. Business Overview for additional discussion of the laws and regulations applicable to CIT and CIT Bank.\nProposals for legislation to further regulate, restrict, and tax certain financial services activities are continually being introduced in the United States Congress and in state legislatures. In addition, the agencies regulating the financial services industry periodically issue new regulations and adopt changes to their existing regulations. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, increased costs in connection with any change to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as any change may necessitate adjustments to the Company\u2019s existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure and could result in increased competition. In addition, we expect that we will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision, and that the level of scrutiny and the enforcement environment may fluctuate over time, based on numerous factors, including changes in the U.S. presidential administration or one or both houses of Congress and public sentiment regarding financial institutions (which can be influenced by scandals and other incidents that involve participants in the industry). We are unable to predict the form or nature of any future changes to statutes or regulation, including the interpretation or implementation thereof. Changes to our supervision or regulation could significantly affect our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective manner, restrict the type of activities in which we are permitted to engage, impact our business strategy (including our ability to return capital) or subject us to stricter and more conservative capital, leverage, liquidity, and risk management standards. Any such action could have a substantial impact on us, significantly increase our costs, limit our growth opportunities, affect our strategies and business operations and increase our capital requirements, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Aviation Lending, Rail, Maritime and other equipment financing operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In the U.S., our equipment leasing operations, including for railcars, ships, and other equipment, are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards promulgated by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Association of American Railroads, the Maritime Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Similar governmental agencies issue similar rules and regulations in other countries in which we do business. In 2015, the PHMSA and TC each released final rules establishing enhanced design and performance criteria for tank cars loaded with a flammable liquid and requiring retrofitting of existing tank cars to meet the enhanced standards within a specified time frame. In addition, the U.S. Congress enacted the FAST Act, which, among other things, expanded the scope of tank cars classified as carrying flammable liquids, added additional design and performance criteria for tank cars in flammable service, and required additional studies of certain criteria established by PHMSA and TC. In addition, state agencies regulate some aspects of rail and maritime operations with respect to health and safety matters not otherwise preempted by federal law. Our business operations and our equipment financing and leasing portfolios may be adversely impacted by rules and regulations promulgated by governmental and industry agencies, which could require substantial modification, maintenance, or refurbishment of our railcars, ships, or other equipment, or potentially make such equipment inoperable or obsolete. Violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.\nSeveral states have recently enacted consumer privacy laws that impose compliance obligations with respect to personal information. For example, the CCPA was enacted in June 2018, and became effective for certain companies conducting business in California on January 1, 2020. The CCPA imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to consumer data privacy rights. In November 2020, voters in the State of California approved the CPRA, a ballot measure that amends and supplements the CCPA by creating the California Privacy Protection Agency, a watchdog privacy agency to be appointed shortly after the CPRA\u2019s enactment. The CPRA also modifies the CCPA by expanding both the scope of businesses covered by the law and certain rights relating to personal information and its use, collection, and disclosure by covered businesses. Compliance with the CCPA, the CPRA as it phases in, and other state statutes, common law, or regulations designed to protect consumer, employee, or applicant personal data could potentially require substantive technology infrastructure and process changes across many of CIT\u2019s businesses. Non-compliance with the CCPA, CPRA, or similar laws and regulations could lead to substantial regulatory imposed fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action, and/or reputational harm. CIT cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted, or the substance and impact of any legislation on CIT. Future legislation could result in substantial costs to CIT and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, and may from time to time be involved in government investigations and inquiries, related to the conduct of our business, the results of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nWe are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, and may from time to time be involved in government and regulatory investigations and inquiries, relating to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of our business (collectively, \"Litigation\"). We are also at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to Litigation they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. It is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of Litigation matters, particularly when such matters are in their early stages or where the claimants seek indeterminate damages. We cannot state\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nwith certainty what the eventual outcome of the pending Litigation will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines, or penalties related to each pending matter will be, if any. The actual results from resolving Litigation matters may involve substantially higher costs and expenses than the amounts reserved or amounts estimated to be reasonably possible, or judgments may be rendered, or fines or penalties assessed in matters for which we have no reserves or have not estimated reasonably possible losses. Adverse judgments, fines or penalties in one or more Litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe and/or our affiliates are involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies.\nWe and/or our affiliates are involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies, regarding our customers and businesses. Because our businesses are complex and subject to continuing change, and because they are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign authorities, the outcome of any of these requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and their impact on us can be difficult to predict. In addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution may give rise to an inquiry or investigation by regulators or other authorities of the same or similar practices by us. For example, an event of improper sales practices at other financial institutions, including the opening of fraudulent customer accounts, has prompted close scrutiny of consumer banking practices by regulators and the media.\nMoreover, the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S. means that a single event or topic may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings. Such matters may result in material adverse consequences, including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of our SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures.\nThere has been a trend of large settlements with governmental agencies that may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions, to the extent they are used as a template for other settlements in the future. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements with other financial institutions. The uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and actual settlements or penalties.\nOur investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe invest in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable energy resources. Our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. We are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside of our control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed. If we are unable to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOperational Risks\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain, which include assumptions and estimates of current risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. Because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates involved in preparing our financial statements, we may be required to undertake one or a number of actions that include, but are not limited to, increasing our allowance (and/or sustaining losses that are significantly higher than reserves); recognizing significant impairment charges to goodwill; or increasing our accrued income taxes. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d section of the MD&A for additional discussion of our accounting estimates.\nIn particular, our critical accounting estimates include the ACL, including the impact of CECL accounting due to the impact of the pandemic from COVID-19, realizability of deferred tax assets, and goodwill impairment. The quality of our loans and leases depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. We maintain a consolidated ACL on our loans to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. The amount of our ACL reflects management's judgment of losses inherent in the portfolio. CECL introduced many new methodologies and assumptions for the reserving process, most notably assumptions for macroeconomic forecasts and future cash flows.\nOur ACL may not keep pace with changes in the credit-worthiness of our customers or in collateral values. If the credit quality of our customer base declines, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes significantly, if we are unable to collect the full amount on accounts receivable taken as collateral, or if the value of equipment, real estate, or other collateral deteriorates significantly, our ACL may prove inadequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSee Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 and the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d section of the\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nMD&A for additional discussions.\nManagement reviews our intangible assets for impairment in accordance with GAAP on an annual basis, or more often as warranted by changes in events or circumstances. See Note 25 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Item 8 and the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d section of the MD&A for additional discussion of goodwill impairment testing.\nIf the models that we use in our business are poorly designed and/or implemented, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values, including valuations associated with acquisitions. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models or gaps in model risk management process present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information, or lack compensating controls. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely if their perception is that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information or necessary compensating controls is insufficient.\nWe are party to various financing arrangements, commercial contracts and other arrangements that under certain circumstances give, or in some cases may give, the counterparty the ability to exercise rights and remedies under such arrangements which, if exercised, may have material adverse consequences.\nWe are party to various financing arrangements, commercial contracts and other arrangements, such as securitization transactions, derivatives transactions, funding facilities, and agreements to purchase or sell loans, leases or other assets, that give, or in some cases may give, the counterparty the ability to exercise rights and remedies upon the occurrence of certain events. Such events may include a material adverse effect or material adverse change (or similar event), a breach of representations or warranties, a failure to disclose material information, a breach of covenants, certain insolvency events, a default under certain specified other obligations, or a failure to comply with certain financial covenants. The counterparty could have the ability, depending on the arrangement, to, among other things, require early repayment of amounts owed by us or our subsidiaries and in some cases payment of penalty amounts, or require the repurchase of assets previously sold to the counterparty. Additionally, a default under financing arrangements or derivatives transactions that exceed a certain size threshold in the aggregate may also cause a cross-default under instruments governing our other financing arrangements or derivatives transactions. If the ability of any counterparty to exercise such rights and remedies is triggered and we are unsuccessful in avoiding or minimizing the adverse consequences discussed above, such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to risk of environmental liability or claims for negligence, property damage, or personal injury when we take title to properties or lease certain equipment.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate that contains or was used in the manufacture or processing of hazardous materials or that is subject to other environmental risks. In addition, we may lease equipment to our customers that is used to mine, develop, process, or transport hazardous materials. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities or claims for negligence, property damage, or personal injury with respect to these properties or equipment. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation, and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, accidents or other hazardous risks, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site or equipment involved in a hazardous incident, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination, property damage, personal injury or other hazardous risks emanating from the property or related to the equipment. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities or claims for negligence, property damage, or personal injury, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our systems, employees, and certain third-party vendors and service providers in conducting our operations, and certain operational failures, including internal or external fraud, operational errors, or systems malfunctions, could materially adversely affect our operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical and recordkeeping errors, and computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Our businesses depend on our ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. If any of our operational, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings (including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyber attackers), we could be materially adversely affected. We are similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or intentional sabotage or fraudulent manipulation of our operations or systems. Third parties with which we do business, including vendors that provide internet access, portfolio servicing, deposit products, or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns, failures, capacity constraints of their own systems or employees, or cyber security attacks through their systems to our systems. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or cause financial loss, potential liability to clients, inability to secure insurance, reputational damage, or regulatory intervention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nIn addition, there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The computer systems and network systems we and others use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These problems may arise in both our internally developed systems and the systems of third-party hardware, software, and service providers. Any such failure could affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance. The adverse impact of disasters, terrorist activities, or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, analyze, and mitigate the types of risk to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, legal and compliance risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, and operational risk related to our employees, systems and vendors, among others. Any system of control and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.\nA failure in our internal controls or our systems or strategies to mitigate risk could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also our reputation with customers, regulators and investors, which is critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and highly-skilled management and employees. Our reputation can be damaged as a result of any number of circumstances, including, among others, employee misconduct, regulatory action or litigation. Moreover, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the advent and expansion of social media creates the potential for rapid and widespread dissemination of inaccurate, misleading, or false information that could damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract and retain customers and employees.\nIf our risk management framework proves ineffective, we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, and we could incur litigation, negative regulatory consequences, reputational damages or other adverse consequences and we could suffer unexpected losses that may affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nSee the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section of the MD&A for additional discussion of our risk management framework and related risks.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and if we are unable to implement new or upgraded technology when required, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introduction of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in our operations. If we are unable to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow us to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, or if we implement technology that is susceptible to information security breaches or cyber security attacks, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face risks of data breaches and cybersecurity attacks that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nThe use of computing devices is critical to our operations and businesses and those of our customers, service providers and vendors. The importance of computing devices has continued to increase, particularly in light of work-from-home arrangements implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we face cybersecurity risks, both directly and through our third party service providers, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, ransomware, and identity theft, that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure. Information security risks, including privacy risk for large financial institutions such as CIT, have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the implementation of work-from-home arrangements, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. Our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers' devices have and may become the target of cyber-attacks or data breaches that, if successful, could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of CIT's or our customers' confidential, proprietary and other information, including personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, or otherwise disrupt CIT's or its customers' or other third parties' business operations.\nIn recent years, there have been several well-publicized attacks on various companies, including in the retail, financial services, media and entertainment, social media, and other industries, and personal, proprietary, and public e-mail systems in which the perpetrators gained unauthorized access to confidential information and customer data, or locked data from access and use through encryption and demanded ransom to unlock the data (ransomware), often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, phishing, social engineering, or other means. Recently, there have also been a series of Business Email Compromise (\u201cBEC\u201d) incidents on public companies. In a BEC incident, fraudsters use spoofed or compromised email accounts to trick an organization\u2019s personnel into effectuating wire transfers to financial accounts controlled by the fraudsters.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nEven if not directed at CIT specifically, attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.\nSince January 1, 2018, we have not experienced any material data breaches involving either proprietary or customer, employee, or applicant information. However, if we, or our third-party service providers, are the victim of a successful cyber-attack or other data breach in the future, either the Company or its customers may suffer material losses. While CIT maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, including significant deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risk, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the risk that protective measures in place, despite their sophistication, may be defeated, the prominent size and scale of CIT and its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our online banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers (including on-line and mobile applications), our geographic footprint, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. We have expended significant resources to develop cybersecurity systems and other protective measures. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and mitigate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The inherent limitations in investigating and remediating an information security incident could also further increase the cost and consequences of such incident. We expect that any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable and that there would be some passage of time before the completion of any investigation and before full and reliable information is available to us. During such time we may not know the extent of any harm to us or our customers, or how best to remediate the incident, and certain errors or actions could be repeated and compounded before they are discovered and remediated.\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, or a failure to adequately disclose such disruptions, failures, cyber-attacks, or security breaches to our customers, suppliers, or vendors or to the financial markets, could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, remediation costs, including preventative costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThere are risks associated with CIT\u2019s common stock that may affect its market price or make it difficult to resell.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and can fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nOur operating results and financial condition, including whether our operating results vary from expectations of management, securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nOperating results and stock price performance of our peers;\n\u2022\nOur creditworthiness or changes in our credit ratings;\n\u2022\nDevelopments in our business or the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nMarketplace perceptions of us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nTechnological developments;\n\u2022\nRegulatory changes;\n\u2022\nWhether we declare or fail to declare dividends on our common stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\nChanges in executive management;\n\u2022\nChanges in the financial markets or economy; and\n\u2022\nGeopolitical conditions, such acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance. Increased volatility as a result of these or other causes could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, federal and state banking law, including regulatory approval requirements, impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over a BHC or an insured depository institution, such as CIT and CIT Bank. These laws may be perceived by the market as having an anti-takeover effect, and may prevent a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of the Company. These laws could result in CIT being less attractive to a potential acquirer and/or could affect the price that investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, it could result in a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements.\nManagement of CIT is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2020, the Company reported no material weaknesses, as disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. However, if we identify material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal controls, or if material weaknesses or other deficiencies exist that we fail to identify, our risk will be increased that a material misstatement to our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any such potential material misstatement, if not prevented or detected, could require us to restate previously released financial statements and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nChanges in accounting standards or interpretations could materially impact our reported earnings and financial condition.\nThe FASB, the SEC and other regulatory agencies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of CIT's consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, potentially resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings.\nSee Note 1 - Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Item 8 for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that could impact CIT and its business.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters, acts or threats of terrorism, pandemics and other catastrophic conditions or events that are beyond our control.\nWe have a nationwide business with customers and operation centers in multiple states, some of which are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods, and droughts. These types of natural catastrophic events have at times disrupted the local economies and our customers, business and facilities. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on our customers, and in turn on our business. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be successful upon the occurrence of one of these scenarios, and a significant catastrophic event anywhere in the world could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nTerrorist attack, threats of terrorism, or other hostilities may disrupt our business and operations or those of our customers. In addition, these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending, which could harm our business and operations. Any of these events could increase volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets, which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to (i) sudden and significant declines, and significant increases in volatility, in financial markets; (ii) ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, including transportation, natural resources, retail, hospitality and commercial real estate; (iii) customers drawing on credit lines to increase liquidity; and (iv) heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements. In addition, many of our customers, counterparties and third-party service providers have been, and may further be, affected by \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, market volatility, supply chain disruption, and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to repay loans, perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide other essential services. As a result, our credit, operational and other risks are generally expected to increase until the pandemic subsides.\nAlthough we have a business continuity plan that is designed to provide for our continuing operation in case of potentially disruptive events, such as a global pandemic, there can be no guarantee that our plan will effectively address some or all of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a recurrence or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, or another future pandemic event or global health emergency. Our business operations may be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, or if we are unable to maintain service in our branches, lockboxes, or other operations that cannot be operated remotely.\nWe may be adversely affected by deterioration in economic conditions that is general in scope or affects specific industries, products or geographic areas.\nWeak economic conditions are likely to have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. Prolonged economic weakness or other adverse economic or financial developments in the U.S. or global economies in general, or affecting specific industries, geographic locations and/or products, would likely adversely impact credit quality as borrowers may fail to meet their debt payment obligations, particularly customers with highly leveraged loans. Adverse economic conditions have in the past and could in the future result in declines in collateral values, which also decreases our ability to fund and collect against collateral. This would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The value to us of other assets such as investment securities, most of which are debt securities or other financial instruments supported by loans, similarly would be negatively impacted by widespread decreases in credit quality resulting from a weakening of the economy. Accordingly, higher credit and collateral related losses and decreases in the value of financial instruments could impact our financial position or operating results. A deterioration in economic conditions could result in a reduction in wholesale market liquidity for financial instruments, negatively impacting our financial condition.\nAside from a general economic downturn, a downturn in certain industries may result in reduced demand for products that we finance in that industry or negatively impact collection and asset recovery efforts. Decreased demand for the products of various manufacturing customers due to recession or other economic factors, such as increased tariffs, may adversely affect their ability to repay their loans and leases with us. Similarly, a decline in railroad shipping volumes may adversely affect our rail business, the value of our rail assets, and the ability of our lessees to make lease payments. Further, a decrease in prices or reduced demand for certain raw materials or bulk products, such as oil, coal, or steel, may result in a significant decrease in gross revenues and profits of our borrowers and lessees or a decrease in demand for certain types of equipment for the production, processing and transport of such raw materials or bulk products, including certain specialized railcars, which may adversely affect the ability of our customers to make payments on their loans and leases and the value of our rail assets and other leased equipment.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\nWe are also affected by the economic and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in reaction to economic conditions. Changes in monetary policies of the FRB directly impact our cost of funds for lending, raising capital, and investment activities, and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, such changes may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict.\nWe may be adversely affected by global political and economic uncertainties.\nGlobal financial markets, including the United States, face political and economic uncertainties that may delay investment and hamper economic activity. International events, such as trade disputes, separatist movements, leadership changes, and political and military conflicts, could adversely affect global financial activity and markets and could negatively affect the U.S. economy. The results of the 2020 federal elections in the U.S. could lead to additional political stalemate or disruption, or significant policy changes, which could negatively impact financial markets or macroeconomic conditions. Changes in monetary or other policies by the FRB or other major central banks could increase the risk of recession or negatively impact asset values and credit spreads. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), or Brexit, could negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that extend beyond the U.K. and the EU. Any of these potential negative effects on financial markets and economic activity could lead to reduced revenues, increased costs, increased credit risks and volatile markets, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretations of such laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. Changes to the tax laws, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our net income.\nThese changes could affect our regulatory capital ratios as calculated in accordance with the Basel III Rules. The exact impact is dependent upon the effects an amendment has on our net DTAs arising from NOL and tax credit carryforwards, versus our net DTAs related to temporary timing differences, as the former is a deduction from capital (the numerator to the ratios), while the latter is included in RWA (the denominator). See \"Regulation - Banking Supervision and Regulation - Capital Requirements\" section of Item 1. Business Overview for further discussion regarding the impact of DTAs on regulatory capital.\nIn addition, our ability to continue to record our DTAs is dependent on our ability to realize their value through future projected earnings. Future changes in tax laws or regulations could adversely affect our ability to record our DTAs. Loss of part or all of our DTAs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See the \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates - Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets\u201d section of the MD&A for additional discussion regarding our DTAs.\nIt could adversely affect our business if we fail to retain and/or attract skilled employees.\nOur business and results of operations will depend in part upon our ability to retain and attract highly skilled and qualified executive officers and management, financial, compliance, technical, marketing, sales, and support employees. Competition for qualified executive officers and employees can be challenging, and CIT cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining such individuals. This competition can lead to increased expenses in many areas. If we fail to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete or operate our business successfully, or to meet our operations, risk management, compliance, regulatory, funding and financial reporting requirements.\nIn 2016, the federal bank regulators and the SEC jointly published proposed rules designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions. The agencies have taken no action on the proposed rules since they were introduced, and it cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted. Compliance with such a final rule, if approved, may substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. Depending on the nature and application of the final rules, we may not be able to successfully compete with certain financial institutions and other companies that are not subject to some or all of the rules to retain and attract executives and other high performing employees. If this were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020", "PERMNO": 93150, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CIT"}
