RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the following Risk Factors before deciding whether to invest in Aspen Group. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations or our financial condition. If any of the events discussed in the Risk Factors below occur, our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the value and marketability of the common stock could decline.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our common stock. The following is a summary of the principal risk factors we face:\n\u2022the sufficiency of our cash resources;\n\u2022any inability by AU to comply with the terms of the Consent Agreement and probation imposed by the AZ BON;\n\u2022strong competition in the postsecondary education market;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any future public health emergencies;\n\u2022our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy of opening new nursing campuses;\n\u2022our ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022continued growth and acceptance of online education;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts;\n\u2022the accuracy of our assumptions with respect to our long-term accounts receivable;\n\u2022continued demand for the nursing workforce;\n\u2022the long-term success of our monthly payment plan;\n\u2022our ability to develop awareness among, and attract and retain, high quality learners to our schools;\n\u2022the impact on our business of failure by the third parties on which we rely to provide services in running our operations, including administration and hosting of learning management system software for our online classroom;\n\u2022any system disruptions to our online computer networks;\n\u2022the loss of the services of key personnel and our continued ability to attract and retain our faculty, administrators, management and skilled personnel;\n\u2022our and our service providers\u2019 ability to update the technology that we rely upon to offer online education;\n\u2022any interruption to our technology infrastructure or service on our websites, including through privacy and data security breaches;\n\u2022the potential impact of new laws or regulations governing Internet commerce;\n\u2022compliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security, advertising and consumer protection, government access requests, or, new laws in one or more of these areas;\n\u2022failure to protect our intellectual property and the impact of potential intellectual property infringement claims against us;\n\u2022inflation and government responses thereto could result in a recession in the U.S., which could adversely impact us, directly and through lower student enrollments;\n\u2022tax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce;\n\u2022potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets arising from the USU acquisition;\n\u2022failure to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business;\n\u2022our continued ability to maintain authorizations in the states where we have campuses;\n\u2022our ability to achieve and maintain a required minimum pass rate on the NCLEX in the BSN Pre-Licensure nursing programs;\n\u2022potential repayment liability to the Department of Education (the \u201cDOE\u201d) resulting from a defense to repayment of federal student loans by our students;\n\u2022our continued ability to maintain institutional accreditation and comply with the complex regulations associated with Title IV Programs;\n\u2022USU\u2019s provisional certification by the DOE resulting in the need to reestablish our eligibility and certification to participate in the Title IV Programs;\n\u2022potential adverse actions and litigation resulting from compliance reviews by the DOE;\n\u2022potential loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if percentage of our revenues derived from Title IV Programs is too high;\n\u2022new regulations or congressional action or reduction in funding for Title IV Programs;\n\u2022potential sanctions for failure to calculate correctly and return timely Title IV Program funds for students who stop participating before completing their educational program;\n\u2022potential loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs, including as the result of our distance education programs being considered \u201ccorrespondence courses,\u201d failure to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d or \u201cadministrative capability,\u201d failure by third parties on which we rely to administer our participation in Title IV Programs to comply with applicable regulations, or loan default rates;\n\u2022potential sanctions for failure to comply with the DOE\u2019s substantial misrepresentation rules or credit hour requirements;\n\u2022future legislation or additional rulemaking by the DOE that may limit or condition Title IV Program participation of proprietary schools; and\n\u2022potential sanctions for failure to comply with the federal campus safety and security reporting requirements as implemented by the DOE.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nIn order to meet our working capital needs, we expect to raise capital or materially reduce our cash outflows.\nIn order to meet our short-term working capital requirements and to achieve our operational goals during the next 12 months, we expect to either raise sufficient capital or reduce our expenditures. While we consider our plans through the end of August, we have implemented two key steps. First we have reduced our marketing expenses by $700,000 per month on an interim basis. Our monthly marketing spend had been approximately $1.4 million. In addition, we expect to enter into an at-the-market offering which has the potential to supply additional cash. As of July 22, 2022, we have $4.2 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\nThe issuance of securities by us in a financing could have a dilutive effect on our current investors, and any such issuance or the possibility of such issuance may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, any debt or equity financing secured by us could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital, continue our operations as presently contemplated and to pursue business opportunities. If we are unable to raise additional capital sufficient to meet our current requirements and growth goals, we may have to further reduce our operations. There can be no assurance that such funding will be available to the Company in the amount required at any time or, if available, that it can be obtained on terms satisfactory to the Company. Finally, even a temporary reduction of marketing will effect our future enrollments and class starts and reduce our future revenue.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the probation terms under the Consent Agreement with the Arizona State Board of Nursing, or fail to meet the requirements of other states in which we operate, our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAspen University, our largest subsidiary which is based in Phoenix, Arizona, entered into a Consent Agreement related to its BSN pre-licensure program in Arizona, in which the AZ BON revoked its approval of AU\u2019s core component of its pre-licensure program in Arizona but simultaneously imposed a conditional stay on the revocation. Approximately 12% of AU\u2019s enrollments are students in its BSN Pre-Licensure nursing programs at two campus locations in Phoenix. The AU Arizona Pre-Licensure program accounted for 19.5% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2022 and is projected to decline to approximately 10% of our revenue in fiscal year 2023.\nThe stay is broken into two phases. During Phase I of the Consent Agreement which lasts through calendar year 2022, Aspen University is not permitted to enroll any new students into the core component of its pre-licensure nursing program in Arizona, and must achieve the AZ BON required 80% NCLEX first-time pass rate for the Calendar Year 2022 annual reporting cycle. If this benchmark is not achieved, the AZ BON may lift the stay and initiate the revocation. If Phase I is completed successfully, Phase II will commence with Aspen University on Probation (regular or \u201cstayed revocation\u201d probation, depending on the outcome of Phase I). During Phase II, Aspen University is permitted to begin enrollments into the core component of its pre-licensure nursing program in Arizona once four consecutive quarters of 80% first-time pass rate occurs. However, if the NCLEX pass rate falls below 80% for any quarter, the AZ BON may limit enrollments, and repeated failures may result in a required cessation of enrollments and teach-out of the program. Aspen University did not meet the 80% minimum for the first two quarters of 2022.\nAs long as Aspen University is unable to enroll new students in the Phoenix metro area, our results of operations and cash flow may be materially and adversely affected. Until the minimum probationary period ends, should Aspen University not successfully satisfy the probation terms, our future results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, if we lose the Arizona approval and are forced to teach out those locations as a result of the foregoing developments, we will be prohibited from further utilizing the two Phoenix campus locations for future in-person pre-licensure classes at AU, and will be forced to find other uses for the premises, such as subletting the premises to USU or an outside party which we may be unable to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In such an event, our investments in those campuses will not result in the long-term benefits originally anticipated, and our future prospects at those locations would be materially diminished.\nFurther, any similar adverse developments in other states in which we operate could also have a material adverse effect on us. The regulatory risks of our other state locations could also be at higher risk as a result of the developments in Arizona as regulators could review our operations with enhanced scrutiny following the investigations and actions taken by the AZ BON.\nIf the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education does not reduce the surety bond, it will eliminate one possible way of increasing our working capital.\nThe Arizona Board required us to post an $18.3 million surety bond which we were able to do. In addition to the premium cost, we had to subordinate our $20 million debt financing to support the surety bond which eliminated our ability to borrow additional funds from the two lenders. If the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education does not agree during this fiscal year to reduce the size of the surety bond, we will have to incur the cost of an additional renewal premium and be unable to use the debt facility for our working capital needs.\nAs a result of the disclosure of the recent AZ BON probation and related matters, we are subject to a class action lawsuit and are or may become subject other litigation which could expose us to significant costs and cause business and reputational harm.\nAs more particularly described in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings,\u201d in April 2022 certain students who had completed the PPN portion of AU\u2019s BSN Pre-Licensure nursing degree program filed a class action lawsuit in Arizona state court against AU, alleging violation of the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act and unjust enrichment, claiming that AU made false representations and promises and material omissions to the students with respect to its BSN Pre-Licensure program in Arizona. To the extent that costs exceed our insurance coverage, we could be materially and adversely affected. Further, the existence and facts alleged in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our public image, and in turn on future enrollments.\nShould we fail to effectively defend against the above lawsuit, or other litigation arises against us with respect to AU Arizona or otherwise, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nBecause there is strong competition in the postsecondary education market, especially in the online education market and as a result of COVID-19, our cost of acquiring students may increase and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nPostsecondary education is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two-year and four-year brick and mortar institutions as well as other for-profit schools and online not-for-profit schools. Public and private colleges and universities, as well as other for-profit schools, offer programs similar to those we offer. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions that create large endowments and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. Accordingly, public and private institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for-profit sector. In addition, some of our competitors, including both traditional colleges and universities and online for-profit schools, have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students. We also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including established colleges and universities that have not previously emphasized online education programs, a trend which has been amplified and accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Major brick and mortar universities continue to develop and advertise their online course offerings. Purdue University\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Kaplan University and the University of Arizona Global Campus\u2019 2020 acquisition of Ashford University are prime examples of this change. Another example is Arizona State University which spends considerable sums on advertising its online degree programs in partnership with its Online Program Manager.\nCOVID-19 has created a tendency to increase remote learning as well as create a movement away from in person interactions to a limited extent. Our for-profit competitors such as Adtalem Global Education, Inc. and American Public Education, Inc., as well as public non-profit institutions, shifted their licensure program from on-campus classes to 100% online classes in response to the pandemic, although transitions back to campus learning have commenced or been completed in some cases. Because the long-term effects of COVID-19, including the widespread adoption of online learning methods employed by our competitors, remain uncertain, the resulting increase in competition may subsist going forward. For example, our competitors may determine that a new potential revenue stream has been opened to them and decide to maintain their increased online course offerings indefinitely or permanently to capitalize on the perceived opportunities, which would result in relatively new additional competitors.\nAdditionally, another side effect of the pandemic was to force many prospective higher education students in the U.S. to defer commencement of their college and postsecondary courses and/or to more closely consider the possibility of declining to pursue a college or post-graduate degree. The result of these and other factors has been steepened declines in new college and graduate student enrollments in recent years.\nWhile we believe another factor in this decline has been the sustained increases in degree costs, which could render our offerings more attractive than some competitors given the relatively lower costs of our programs to other more traditional educational programs, the trend poses significant uncertainty and challenges to the industry as a whole, including AGI, and may cause us to experience lower revenue, be less competitive and otherwise harm our business as we continue to compete with a lower and lower pool of prospective enrollments.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures including price pressures that could adversely affect our business or results of operations and reduce our operating margins. These competitive factors could cause our enrollments, revenues and profitability to materially decrease.\nCOVID-19 has materially and adversely affected our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant downturn to the U.S. and global economies for an extended period. Our nursing students include many working nurses who became over stressed due to the healthcare crisis and necessary long hours they had\nto work. As a result, our attrition rates increased. We also believe nursing students delayed taking courses and also enrollments were adversely affected.\nAll of these factors and remote work inefficiencies have materially and adversely affected our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy of opening new nursing campuses, our results of operations and future growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition to its two existing campus locations in Phoenix, the Company opened two additional new metro locations in fiscal year 2021 (Austin and Tampa) and opened two new locations in fiscal year 2022 (Nashville and Atlanta). Opening new campus locations will require us to obtain appropriate state and accrediting agency approvals and to comply with any requirements from those agencies related to a new location. Adding new locations will also require significant financial investments, including capital improvements, human resource capabilities, and new clinical placement relationships. If we are unable to obtain the required approvals, attract sufficient additional students to new campus locations, offer programs at new campuses in a cost-effective manner, identify appropriate clinical placements, or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established campus locations, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the event that we are unable to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, our results of operations may be harmed.\nThe updates and expansions of our existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers. If we cannot respond to changes in market requirements, our business may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, we may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned, delayed or declined in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. In addition, a new academic program that must prepare students for gainful employment must be approved by the DOE for Title IV purposes if the institution is provisionally certified. If we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints, regulatory limitations or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs may require us to make investments in management and faculty, incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources. If we are unable to increase the number of students, or offer new programs in a cost-effective manner, or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nBecause we are an online provider of education, we are substantially dependent on continued growth and acceptance of online education and, if the recognition by students and employers of the value of online education does not continue to grow, our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe believe that continued growth in online education will be largely dependent on additional students and employers recognizing the value of degrees and courses from online institutions. If students and employers are not convinced that online schools are an acceptable alternative to traditional schools or that an online education provides necessary value, or if growth in the market penetration of exclusively online education slows, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. Because our business model is in part based on online education, if the acceptance of online education does not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts, if those efforts are unsuccessful we may not be profitable in the future.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon our media performance, including our ability to:\n\u2022Maintain and grow our nursing programs including Aspen University\u2019s BSN Pre-Licensure hybrid online/campus program; USU\u2019s MSN-FNP program; Aspen University\u2019s legacy Baccalaureate, Master\u2019s and Doctoral online degree programs; and USU's legacy Baccalaureate and Master's degree programs;\n\u2022Select communities which have excess demand for nursing students interested in an on-campus model. In this respect, we are uncertain if our commercial experience in Phoenix can be replicated in other metros. To date we have not had the same enrollment results in Austin, Tampa, or Nashville; and Atlanta began enrollments in February 2022; Further,\nenrollments in Tampa have been much lower than expected due to students in Florida preferring Associate-level, 2-year nursing degree programs versus Bachelor-level pre-licensure programs;\n\u2022Replicate the success we have had with nursing in other programs;\n\u2022Create greater awareness of our schools and our programs;\n\u2022Identify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market and specific media vehicle;\n\u2022Determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures;\n\u2022Comply with applicable laws and regulations affecting our marketing activities; and\n\u2022Effectively manage marketing costs (including creative and media).\nFurther as a result of our cash needs, we will not be able to expand BSN Pre-Licensure program beyond Atlanta until we improve our operating results.\nOur marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness. If our media performance is not effective, our future results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. Further, as disclosed earlier in this Report and Item 7, we are purposely slowing our growth rate and re-allocating marketing expenses. We may not achieve the results anticipated for a number of reasons including any future recession, unanticipated regulatory actions, the impact of COVID-19 on nurse enrollments and any adverse reaction of potential students who learn of the regulatory actions in Arizona.\nBecause of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the effect on the capital markets and the economy is uncertain, and we may have to deal with a recessionary economy and economic uncertainty including possible adverse effects upon our business.\nAs a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, certain events have affected the global and United States economy including increased inflation, substantial increases in the prices of oil and gas and other goods, large Western companies ceasing to do business in Russia and uncertain capital markets with declines in leading market indexes. The duration of this war and its impact are at best uncertain and continuation may result in Internet access issues if Russia, for example, began illicit cyber activities. In addition, in the U.S. the Federal Reserve has begun raising interest rates sharply, the continuation of which could lead to a recession. Ultimately the economy may turn into a recession with uncertain and potentially severe impacts upon public companies and us. We cannot predict how this will affect our business but the impact may be adverse. If the U.S. or global economy enters a recession, one possible if not probable result could be reduced spending by individuals on higher education, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nIf our assumptions with respect to our long-term accounts receivable prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to take a charge to our Allowance for Doubtful accounts and incur a material non-cash charge to earnings.\nAs a result of the growing acceptance of our monthly payment plans, our long-term accounts receivable balance has grown from $10,249,833 at April 30, 2021 to $11,406,525 at April 30, 2022. The primary component consists of students who make monthly payments over 36, 39 and 72 months. The average student completes their academic program in 30 months, therefore most of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable are short-term. However, when students graduate earlier than the 30-month average completion duration, and as students enter academic year two of USU\u2019s MSN-FNP 72-month payment plan, they all transition to long-term accounts receivable when their liability increases to over $4,500. Our ability to collect the sums owed directly by students in contrast to the federal government or other third parties is directly tied to the future ability of students to pay us and their other obligations stemming from a variety of factors including the impact of any economic decline in the United States, the students\u2019 individual and family financial conditions, including unemployment and under-employment, health issues which affect students, and/or family members and whether students continue with their courses or cease taking courses. Due to inflation, Federal Interest rate hikes and other factors, many market analysists predict a recession is probable later in 2022 or 2023, which would diminish the spending power of prospective students, as well as possibly reduce demand for our offerings due to a weakened labor market. Further if we experience a recession, it is possible that we will face more difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable from students and former students.\nWhile our management, based on its experience, makes assumptions which affect the reserves we take against our long-term accounts receivable, these assumptions may be incorrect and the above or other factors may cause us to increase our reserves and reduce the long-term accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet. The amount of any future reductions we take may be a non-cash material charge to future earnings.\nWe experienced a reduction in enrollments year-over-year, and if we are unable to change the trend in future periods, our results of operations and prospects, and your investment in us, could be materially adversely impacted.\nOn a Company-wide basis, new student enrollments were down 14% year-over-year, primarily as a result of three factors: (1) Aspen University dropped advertising spend in the BSN pre-licensure program in the Phoenix metro down to a maintenance spend, causing enrollments in that metro to drop, and subsequently stopped enrollments in Phoenix starting in Q4 of fiscal 2022, (2) enrollments at USU were down 1% year-over-year given the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as prospective nursing post-licensure students continue to delay their education goals on a short-term basis as they continued to care for COVID patients, and (3) Aspen University saw a COVID-19 related increase in attrition among current nursing students and a reduction in prospective nursing post-licensure students. Further, due to the probation imposed by the AZ BON, AU\u2019s Arizona pre-licensure locations will continue to contribute to the slowing of enrollment growth or a decline in enrollments. If the trend continues without offsetting reductions in expenses, it could materially adversely impact our business and financial condition, and in turn reduce our common stock price.\nIf the demand for the nursing workforce decreases or the educational requirements for nurses were relaxed, our business will be adversely affected.\nAspen Group\u2019s primary focus has been the continued growth of enrollment in its nursing programs at both universities. As of April 30, 2022, approximately 86% of our active degree-seeking students were enrolled in our nursing programs. If the demand for nurses or family nurse practitioners does not continue to grow (or declines) or there are changes within the healthcare industry that make the nursing occupation less attractive to learners or reduce the benefits of a bachelor\u2019s or an advanced degree, our enrollment and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAlthough our management has successfully implemented a monthly payment business model, it may not be successful long-term.\nUnder the leadership of Mr. Michael Mathews, our Chief Executive Officer, we have developed a monthly payment business model designed to substantially increase our student enrollment and reduce student debt among Aspen University\u2019s and USU\u2019s student bodies. While results to date have been as anticipated, there are no assurances that this business model will continue to be successful. Among the risks are the following:\n\u2022Our ability to compete with existing online institutions which have substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and academic resources, and enhanced public reputations;\n\u2022The emergence of more successful competitors including traditional campus based universities which accelerated their online presence as a result of the pandemic;\n\u2022Factors related to our marketing, including the costs of Internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;\n\u2022Limits on our ability to attract and retain effective employees because of the incentive compensation rule;\n\u2022Performance problems with our online systems;\n\u2022Our failure to maintain accreditation or regulatory approvals;\n\u2022Student dissatisfaction with our services and programs;\n\u2022Adverse publicity regarding us, our competitors or online or for-profit education generally;\n\u2022A decline in the acceptance of online education;\n\u2022A decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs;\n\u2022The potential that potential students may not be able to afford the monthly payments as a result of declines in the economy;\n\u2022The failure to collect our growing accounts receivable;\n\u2022The inability to expand our monthly payment program due to working capital requirements;\n\u2022If our monthly payment plan business model does not continue to be favorably received, our revenues may not increase.\nIf we are unable to develop awareness among, and attract and retain, high quality learners to our schools, our ability to generate significant revenue or achieve profitability will be significantly impaired.\nBuilding awareness of Aspen University and USU and the programs we offer are critical to our ability to attract prospective learners. If we are unable to successfully market and advertise our educational programs, our ability to attract and enroll prospective students could be adversely affected, and consequently, our ability to increase revenue or achieve profitability could be impaired. It is also critical to our success that we convert these applicants to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these students remain active in our programs. Some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully enrolling and retaining students in our programs include:\n\u2022The emergence of more successful competitors;\n\u2022Factors related to our marketing, including the costs of Internet advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;\n\u2022Performance problems with our online systems;\n\u2022Failure to maintain accreditation or regulatory approvals;\n\u2022Student dissatisfaction with our services and programs, including with our customer service and responsiveness;\n\u2022Adverse publicity regarding us, our competitors, or online or for-profit education in general;\n\u2022Price reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match;\n\u2022A decline in the acceptance of online education or our degree offerings by students or current and prospective employers;\n\u2022Increased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u2022A decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs;\n\u2022Litigation or regulatory investigations including those arising in Arizona that may damage our reputation; and\n\u2022Difficulties in executing on our strategy as a preferred provider to employers for the vertical markets we serve.\nIf we are unable to continue to develop awareness of Aspen University and USU and the programs we offer, and to enroll and retain students, our enrollments would suffer and our ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability would be significantly impaired.\nBecause we rely on third parties to provide certain services in running our operations, if any of these parties fail to provide the agreed services at an acceptable level, it could limit our ability to provide services and/or cause student dissatisfaction, either of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with services in order for us to efficiently and securely operate our business including our computer network and the courses we offer to students. Any interruption in our ability to obtain the services of these or other third parties or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our educational product and overall business. Generally, there are multiple sources for the services we purchase. Our business could be disrupted if we were required to replace any of these third parties, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on third-party administration and hosting of learning management system software for our online classroom, if that third-party were to cease to do business or alter its business practices and services, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate.\nOur online classrooms at Aspen University and USU employ the D2L learning management system called Brightspace. The system is a web-based portal that stores and delivers course content, provides interactive communication between students and faculty, and supplies online evaluation tools. We rely on third parties to host and help with the administration of it. We further rely on third parties, the D2L agreement and our internal staff for ongoing support and customization and integration of the system with the rest of our technology infrastructure. If D2L were unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with service, we may have difficulty maintaining the software required for our online classroom or updating it for future technological changes. Any failure to maintain our online classroom would have an adverse impact on our operations, damage our reputation and limit our ability to attract and retain students.\nIf we cannot manage our growth, our results of operations may suffer and could adversely affect our ability to comply with federal regulations.\nThe growth that we have experienced as well as any future growth that we may experience, may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our management information and reporting systems and financial management controls. We have experienced growth at Aspen University over the last several years and USU has grown significantly since we acquired it, although in the fiscal years 2021 and 2022 our growth has declined primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced marketing spending and regulatory challenges. Further, we have less experience in managing our hybrid programs and anticipate substantial growth from this business. Managing multiple campuses in many locations will pose operational challenges which may impact our ability to manage our business with the same level of effectiveness as we achieved in the past fiscal years. If growth negatively impacts our ability to manage our business, the learning experience for our students could be adversely affected, resulting in a higher rate of student attrition and fewer student referrals. Future growth will also require continued improvement of our internal controls and systems, particularly those related to complying with federal regulations under the Higher Education Act, as administered by the DOE, including as a result of our participation in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV. If we are unable to manage our growth, we may also experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nIf we experience system disruptions to our online computer networks, it could impact our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation, limiting our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe continue to make investments to update our computer network and systems primarily to permit accelerated student enrollment and enhance our students\u2019 learning experience. We plan to make significant changes to our student systems and our accounting systems to enhance our ability to support the growth of the business, improve the visibility of program specific activities and related costs and enhance overall business intelligence to support capital allocation decision making. The performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students and manage our business. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of our online classroom, damaging our reputation, and could cause a loss in enrollment. In addition, changes in systems can be disruptive, divert management's time and typically may involve bugs which cause further disruptions. Our technology infrastructure and systems could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist activities, hacking or cyber security issues and telecommunications failures.\nIf we lose the services of key personnel, it could adversely affect our business.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Our future also significantly depends on the continued services of Mr. Michael Mathews, our Chief Executive Officer. We also rely upon Mr. Matthew LaVay, our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Gerard Wendolowski, our Chief Operating Officer and Dr. Cheri St. Arnauld, our Chief Academic Officer, all of whom are important to the management of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction and would also be difficult to replace. We have a $3 million key man life insurance policy on Mr. Mathews. The loss of the services of Mr. Mathews and other key individuals and the process to replace these individuals would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain our faculty, administrators, management and skilled personnel, we may not be able to support our operations.\nTo maintain our operations and to execute our growth strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified faculty, administrators, management and skilled personnel. Competition for hiring these individuals is intense, especially with regard to faculty in specialized areas. If we fail to attract new skilled personnel or faculty or fail to retain and motivate our existing faculty, administrators, management and skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed. Further, we have moved to a new hybrid model focused on using full-time faculty members in addition to adjunct or part-time faculty. These efforts may not be successful resulting in the loss of faculty and difficulties in recruiting. Further, we cannot predict the effect of our recent layoffs on our retained staff. Our remaining employees may be fearful of being laid off or be concerned over whether we may remain operational. Accordingly, we may sustain a further decline in our employees which could adversely affect the services we provide.\nIf we or our service providers are unable to update the technology that we rely upon to offer online education, our future growth may be impaired.\nWe believe that continued growth will require our service providers to increase the capacity and capabilities of their technology infrastructure. Increasing the capacity and capabilities of the technology infrastructure will require these third parties to invest capital, time and resources, and there is no assurance that even with sufficient investment their systems will be scalable to accommodate future growth. Our service providers may also need to invest capital, time and resources to update their technology in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace. If they are unwilling or unable to increase the capacity of their resources or update their resources appropriately and we cannot change over to other service providers efficiently, our ability to handle growth, our ability to attract or retain students, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we experience any interruption to our technology infrastructure, it could prevent students from accessing their courses, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption.\nOur computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security problems. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, personal information about our students or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches.\nBecause the CAN-SPAM Act imposes certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails, it could adversely impact our ability to market Aspen University\u2019s and USU\u2019s educational services, and otherwise increase the costs of our business.\nThe Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act, establishes requirements for commercial email and specifies penalties for commercial email that violates the CAN-SPAM Act. In addition, the CAN-SPAM Act gives consumers the right to require third parties to stop sending them commercial email.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act covers email sent for the primary purpose of advertising or promoting a commercial product, service, or Internet website. The Federal Trade Commission, a federal consumer protection agency, is primarily responsible for enforcing the CAN-SPAM Act, and the Department of Justice, other federal agencies, state attorneys general, and Internet service providers also have authority to enforce certain of its provisions.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act\u2019s main provisions include:\n\u2022Prohibiting false or misleading email header information;\n\u2022Prohibiting the use of deceptive subject lines;\n\u2022Ensuring that recipients may, for at least 30 days after an email is sent, opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from the sender;\n\u2022Requiring that commercial email be identified as a solicitation or advertisement unless the recipient affirmatively permitted the message; and\n\u2022Requiring that the sender include a valid postal address in the email message.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act also prohibits unlawful acquisition of email addresses, such as through directory harvesting and transmission of commercial emails by unauthorized means, such as through relaying messages with the intent to deceive recipients as to the origin of such messages.\nViolations of the CAN-SPAM Act\u2019s provisions can result in criminal and civil penalties, including statutory penalties that can be based in part upon the number of emails sent, with enhanced penalties for commercial email companies who harvest email addresses, use dictionary attack patterns to generate email addresses, and/or relay emails through a network without permission.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act acknowledges that the Internet offers unique opportunities for the development and growth of frictionless commerce, and the CAN-SPAM Act was passed, in part, to enhance the likelihood that wanted commercial email messages would be received.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act preempts, or blocks, most state restrictions specific to email, except for rules against falsity or deception in commercial email, fraud and computer crime. The scope of these exceptions, however, is not settled, and some states have adopted email regulations that, if upheld, could impose liabilities and compliance burdens in addition to those imposed by the CAN-SPAM Act.\nMoreover, some foreign countries, including the countries of the European Union, have regulated the distribution of commercial email and the online collection and disclosure of personal information. Foreign governments may attempt to apply their laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities.\nBecause we use email marketing, the need to comply with, and any failure by us to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act could adversely affect our marketing activities and increase our costs.\nIf our data or our users\u2019 content is hacked, including through privacy and data security breaches, our business could be damaged, and we could be subject to liability.\nOur business is, and we expect it will continue to be, heavily reliant upon the Internet. Cyber security events have caused significant damage to large well-known companies. If our systems are hacked and our students\u2019 confidential information is misappropriated, we could be subject to liability.\nWe may fail to detect the existence of a breach of user content and be unable to prevent unauthorized access to user and company content. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target. They may originate from less regulated third world countries where lax local enforcement and poverty create opportunities for hacking. If our security measures are breached, or our students\u2019 content is otherwise accessed through unauthorized means, or if any such actions are believed to occur, Aspen University and USU may lose existing students and/or fail to enroll new students or otherwise be materially harmed.\nOur business could be harmed by any significant disruption of service on our websites.\nBecause of the importance of the Internet to our business, in addition to cybersecurity, we face the risk that our systems will fail to function in a robust manner. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our students are dependent upon the\nreliable performance of our websites, including our underlying technical infrastructure. Our technical infrastructure may not be adequately designed with sufficient reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our websites are unavailable when students and professors attempt to access them, or if they experience frequent slowdowns or disruptions, we may lose students and professors.\nIf we incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online during our class discussions, it may affect our future operating results and financial condition.\nIn some instances, our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards. We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions. Third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. As a result, we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages.\nBecause the personal information that we or our vendors collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss, any of these factors could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We use a third parties to collect and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information on our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches, restrict our use of personal information, and cause us to lose our certification to participate in the Title IV Programs. We cannot guarantee that there will not be a breach, loss or theft of personal information that we store or our third parties store. A breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal or administrative actions by state attorneys general, private litigants, and federal regulators and by such other international laws including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \"E.U. GDPR\") and, following the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d) and their respective enforcement mechanisms, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf governments enact new laws to regulate Internet commerce, it may negatively affect our business.\nThe widespread use of the Internet has led and may in the future lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the U.S. and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, data protection and breach copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security, advertising and consumer protection, government access requests, or, if new laws in one or more of these areas are enacted, it could result in proceedings, actions, or penalties against us and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a variety of marketing techniques, including email, radio, telemarketing, display advertising, and social media marketing, targeted online advertisements, and postal mailings, and we are or may become subject to various laws and regulations that govern such marketing and advertising practices. A variety of federal, state, and international laws and regulations, including those enforced by various federal government agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, and state and local agencies, govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, and security of personal data, particularly in the context of online advertising, which we utilize to attract new students.\nThe laws and regulations which may restrict, limit or otherwise affect our advertising efforts include the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act and various U.S. state laws regarding telemarketing. These laws generally impose restrictions on advertising practices, may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and governmental authorities and often require subjective interpretation, which could render our compliance efforts more\nchallenging. We cannot guarantee our efforts to comply with these laws, rules and regulations will be successful, or, if they are successful, that the cost of such compliance will not be materially adverse to our business. If any laws, rules or regulations applicable to our advertising techniques significantly restrict our business, we may not be able to implement adequate alternative communication and marketing strategies at favorable costs or at all. Further, any non-compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may result in financial penalties or litigation, which would adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nThe use and storage of data, files, and information on our websites and those of our third-party service providers concerning, among others, student information is essential to their enrollment in our schools. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing and advertising, and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other regulations or our current practices. As a result, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements, and obligations. We have implemented various features, integrations, and capabilities as well as contractual obligations intended to enable us to comply with applicable privacy and security requirements in our collection, use, and transmittal of data, but these features do not ensure our compliance and may not be effective against all potential privacy concerns. In particular, as a United States company, we may be obliged to disclose data pursuant to government requests under United States law. Compliance with such requests may be inconsistent with local laws in other countries where our students reside. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject, or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection, whether federal, state, or international, could adversely affect our reputation, brand, and business, and may result in claims, proceedings, or actions against us by governmental entities, students, users of our website, third party service providers, or others, or may require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain types of data. Any such claims, proceedings, or actions could hurt our reputation, brand, and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings or actions, result in adverse publicity, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of students and/or third-party service providers, and result in the imposition of monetary penalties.\nThe legislative and regulatory bodies or self-regulatory organizations in various jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations, or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, information security, and online advertising. California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which became operative on January 1, 2020, and its implementing regulations took effect in August, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process personal information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about such companies\u2019 data collection, use, and sharing practices and inform consumers of their personal information rights such as deletion rights, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, in November 2020, California enacted the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), which amends and expands the scope of the CCPA, while introducing new privacy protections that extend beyond those included in the CCPA and its implementing regulations. The CCPA, as amended and expanded by the CPRA, is one of the most prescriptive general privacy law in the United States and may lead to similar laws being enacted in other U.S. states or at the federal level. For example, the State of Nevada also passed a law, which went into effect on October 1, 2019, that amends the state\u2019s online privacy law to allow consumers to submit requests to prevent websites and online service providers (\u201cOperators\u201d) from selling personally identifiable information that Operators collect through a website or online service. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. Each of these privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations, and any other such changes or new laws or regulations, could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business model or practices, or restrict our use or storage of personal information, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct. In addition, any such changes could compromise our ability to develop an adequate marketing strategy and pursue our growth strategy effectively, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, federal and state governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party \u201ccookies\u201d and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. The U.S. government has enacted legislation and regulations, and may enact further legislation or regulations in the future, that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to utilize online behavioral tracking, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to block other tracking technologies, which could, if widely adopted, result in the use of third-party cookies and other methods of online tracking becoming significantly less effective. The regulation of the use of these cookies and other current online tracking and advertising practices or a loss in our ability to make effective use of services that employ such technologies could increase our\ncosts of operations and limit our ability to acquire new students on cost-effective terms and consequently, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAt least 35 states and the District of Columbia introduced or considered almost 200 consumer privacy bills in 2022. More and more states will continue to enact similar laws. Proposed federal legislation, like the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, will likely continue to be debated and, at some point, enacted in some form.\nFurthermore, judgments from foreign courts or regulatory actions of other foreign nations could impact our ability to transfer, process, and/or receive data relating to students outside the United States, or alter our ability to use cookies to deliver advertising and other products to such users. Such judgments or actions could affect the manner in which we provide services to our students or adversely affect our financial results if foreign students are not able to lawfully transfer data to us.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. However, U.S. federal, U.S. state, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, including the CCPA and CPRA are rapidly evolving and may be inconsistent and we could be deemed out of compliance with such laws and their interpretations. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for them. Furthermore, any changes in such laws and regulations or a change or differing interpretation or application to our business of the existing laws and regulations, GDPR, could also hinder our operational flexibility, raise compliance costs and, particularly if our compliance efforts are deemed to be insufficient, result in additional historical or future liabilities and regulatory scrutiny for us, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and our results of operations.\nRelease of personally identifiable information or other confidential information could subject us to civil penalties or cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nAs educational institutions participating in federal and state student assistance programs and collecting financial receipts from students and their families, we collect and retain certain personally identifiable information and other confidential information. Such information is subject to federal and state privacy and security rules, including the Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (\u201cFACTA\u201d). Release or failure to secure confidential information or other noncompliance with FERPA, HIPAA, FACTA or other similar laws could subject us to fines, loss of our capacity to conduct Internet commerce, and loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nJurisdictions, both nationally and internationally, are continuing to enact additional laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing and advertising, and consumer protection, and compliance with one set of laws and regulations rarely suffice for compliance with another.\nOn March 2, 2021, the Governor of Virginia signed into law the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the \u201cVCDPA\u201d), which will go into effect on January 1, 2023. The VCDPA, creates consumer rights, similar to the CCPA, but also imposes security and assessment requirements for businesses. That law applies to all persons that conduct business in Virginia which (i) control or process personal data of at least 100,000 consumers, or, (ii) derive over 50% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data and control or process personal data of at least 25,000 consumers. In addition, on July 7, 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (\u201cCoCPA\u201d), becoming the third comprehensive consumer privacy law to be passed in the United States (after the CCPA and VCDPA), which will go into effect on July 1, 2023. This additional legislation addresses consumers\u2019 rights to privacy, companies\u2019 responsibility to protect personal data, and authorizes the state to take enforcement action for violations. Although the CoCPA closely resembles the VCDPA, both of which do not contain a private right of action and will instead be enforced by the respective states\u2019 Attorney General and district attorneys, the two differ in many ways and once they become enforceable in 2023, we must comply with each if our operations fall within the scope of these newly enacted comprehensive mandates. Section 6(3) of a Connecticut statute signed May 10, 2022, states a data controller shall \u201cestablish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue.\u201d The effective date for that law is July 1, 2023. Utah\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act provides consumers the right to know what personal data a business collects, how the business uses the personal data, and whether the business sells the personal data. The effective date is December 31, 2023. Additionally, Maine recently enacted the Data Collection Protection Act, creating the Maine Data Collection Protection Act, which prohibits data collectors from collecting and aggregating, selling, or using specific types of public documents or information. Prior efforts undertaken to comply with other recent privacy-related laws have proven that\nthese initiatives require time to carefully plan, assess gaps in current compliance mechanisms, and implement new policies, processes and remediation efforts.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret or other protections. This intellectual property includes but is not limited to courseware materials, business know-how and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of operating and various education regulatory agencies. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names, agreements and registrations to protect our intellectual property. We rely on service mark and trademark protection in the U.S. to protect our rights to the mark ASPEN UNIVERSITY and the mark UNITED STATES UNIVERSITY as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. We rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content experts. We cannot assure you that the measures that we take will be adequate or that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the U.S. or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our curricula, online resource material and other content, and offer competing programs to ours.\nIn particular, third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or duplicate or copy aspects of our curriculum, online resource material, quality management and other proprietary content. Any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our business. Protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult, particularly as it relates to the development by our competitors of competing courses and programs.\nWe may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third-party.\nIf we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims, it could cause us to incur significant expenses and pay substantial damages.\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing or violating their intellectual property rights. Any such claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages and prevent us from using our intellectual property that may be fundamental to our business. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation regarding the intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nIf there is new tax treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce, this may adversely affect the commercial use of our marketing services and our financial results.\nDue to the growing budgetary problems facing state and local governments, it is possible that governments might attempt to tax our activities. New or revised tax regulations may subject us to additional sales, income and other taxes. In 2018 the United States Supreme Court ruled that states can tax the sale of goods sold to residents of their respective state. In the wake of the Court\u2019s decision, 45 states and the District of Columbia impose sales taxes on remote business. Although the effective date of these new state taxes vary by state, all collection requirements are expected to be in effect by January 1, 2023. Moreover, the minimum thresholds for the taxes to apply varies by state and ranges $100,000 and $500,000. In addition to monetary threshold requirements, some states also require transaction threshold requirements that range from 100 to 200 transactions. The decision also allows local governments to collect sales tax, per the United States Government Accountability Office; of the 45 states with sales tax 37 also have local sales taxes.\nWhile we are still evaluating the potential impact of these developments, including whether these states are intended to tax educational services, the new or revised tax requirements are expected to increase the cost of doing business online which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition to the direct added costs from any applicable taxes, we may need to establish systems and procedures to track the volume and monetary value of our course offerings and material sales on a state-by-state basis, and, when necessary, collect and remit taxes on behalf of the states, and potentially consult with tax or other experts to monitor and oversee compliance efforts with respect to certain state and local sales tax provisions, which can also be costly. These developments, including any potential failure by us to pay the required tax in a state or locality in which we are deemed to do business, could have an adverse consequences on our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, any of which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business, including our brick and mortar campuses, may experience business interruptions resulting from natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires or significant power outages. In addition to our largest office facility and two locations in Phoenix, AZ, we presently have locations in San Diego, CA, Austin, TX, Tampa, FL, Nashville, TN, and Atlanta, GA, which are susceptible to weather related problems. These events could cause us to close schools - temporarily or permanently - and could affect student recruiting opportunities in those locations, causing enrollment and revenue to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet arising from the USU acquisition become impaired, it would require us to record a material charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs a result of our acquisition of USU, we recorded approximately $5 million of goodwill and $7.9 million of intangible assets which are currently shown as assets on our consolidated balance sheet at April 30, 2022. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and judgments by management. Although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions, including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. If in the future we determine that an impairment exists, we may be required to record a material charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business, we could face penalties and significant restrictions on our operations, including loss of access to Title IV Program funds.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by (1) the federal government through the DOE under the HEA/HEOA, (2) state regulatory bodies and (3) accrediting agencies recognized by the DOE, including the DEAC and WSCUC, institutional accrediting agencies recognized by the DOE. In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs regulate our participation in the military\u2019s tuition assistance program and the VA\u2019s veteran's education benefits program, respectively. The laws, regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and financial condition. These regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to add new or expand existing educational programs and to change our corporate structure and ownership.\nInstitutions of higher education that grant degrees, diplomas, or certificates must be authorized by an appropriate state education agency or agencies. In addition, in certain states, as a condition of continued authorization to grant degrees, a school must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. Accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions, based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution. Accreditation is also required in order to participate in various federal programs, including tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces and the federal programs of student financial assistance administered pursuant to Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act and its implementing regulations require accrediting agencies recognized by the DOE to review and monitor many aspects of an institution\u2019s operations and to take appropriate action when the institution fails to comply with the accrediting agency\u2019s standards.\nOur operations are also subject to regulation due to our participation in Title IV Programs which are administered by the DOE and include loans made directly to students by the DOE and several grant programs for students with economic need as determined in accordance with the HEOA and the DOE regulations. To participate in Title IV Programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and be certified as an eligible institution by the DOE. Our growth strategy is partly dependent on being able to offer financial assistance through Title IV Programs as it may increase the number of potential students who may choose to enroll in our programs. Our highest long-term value program, Aspen University\u2019s BSN Pre-Licensure nursing program, which only offers a monthly payment program for the first year of each program, make these students dependent upon Title IV or other payment options in order to continue their education.\nThe laws, regulations, standards, and policies of the DOE, state education agencies, and our accrediting agencies change frequently particularly when there is a change in the U.S. President. Pending changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable\nlaws, regulations, standards, or policies, or our noncompliance with any applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, activities, receipt of funds under tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces, our ability to participate in Title IV Programs, receipt of veterans education benefits funds, or costs of doing business. Findings of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, standards and policies also could result in our being required to pay monetary damages, or subjected to fines, penalties, injunctions, limitations on our operations, termination of our ability to grant degrees, revocation of our accreditation, restrictions on or loss of our access to Title IV Program funds or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not maintain authorization in Arizona, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia and California and future states where we plan to have campuses, our operations would be curtailed, and we would not be able to grant degrees.\nAspen University is headquartered in Arizona and is authorized by the Arizona Board to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates. Aspen\u2019s BSN Pre-Licensure hybrid program is authorized by the Texas Board, Tennessee Commission, Georgia Commission and Florida Commission. If Aspen were to lose its authorization from the Arizona Board, Texas Board, Tennessee Commission, Georgia Commission or Florida Commission, Aspen would be unable to provide educational services in Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida and would lose its access to accreditation and eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs. USU is headquartered in California and is authorized by the California Bureau to grant degrees, diplomas or certificates. If USU were to lose its authorization from the California Bureau or Arizona Board, it would be unable to provide educational services in California and would lose access to accreditation and its eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs. See the risk factor relating to our operations in Arizona at page 23.\nOur failure to comply with regulations of various states could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues, and results of operations.\nVarious states impose regulatory requirements on education institutions operating within their boundaries. Many states assert jurisdiction over online education institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer education services to students who reside in the state or advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent among states and not well developed in many jurisdictions. As such, these requirements change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear or are left to the discretion of state regulators.\nState laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. To the extent that we have obtained, or obtain in the future, state authorizations or licensure, changes in state laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the applicable regulators may limit our ability to offer educational programs and award degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the DOE. If we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements, we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization. If we fail to comply with state requirements to obtain licensure or authorization, we may be the subject of injunctive actions or other penalties or fines. Loss of licensure or authorization or the failure to obtain required licensures or authorizations could prohibit us from recruiting or enrolling students in particular states, reduce significantly our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the DOE\u2019s 2016 regulations for distance education ultimately took effect on May 26, 2019. On November 1, 2019, the Department issued the Final Regulations on accreditation and the authorization of distance education, which took effect July 1, 2020. Like the 2016 regulations, the Final Regulations require us to (i) obtain authorization to offer our programs from each state where authorization is required or through participation in a reciprocity agreement, and (ii) provide specific consumer disclosures regarding our educational programs, including both general and direct disclosures to current and prospective students relating to professional licensure and whether the curriculum for on-ground and online professional licensure or certification programs meet states\u2019 educational requirements for licensure. If we fail to obtain required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a specific state, we could lose our ability to award Title IV aid to students within that state or be required to refund Title IV funds related to jurisdictions in which we failed to have state authorization. We must be able to document state approval for distance education if requested by the DOE. In addition, effective with the DOE\u2019s new state authorization regulations in effect as of July 1, 2020, the consumer disclosures required pursuant to the distance education rule are detailed and include disclosures regarding licensure and certification requirements, state authorization, student complaints, adverse actions by state and accreditation agencies, and refund policies. These disclosure requirements will require a considerable amount of data gathering needed to support such disclosures and will require our institutions to closely track where students enrolled in online programs are located during the course of their studies. These various disclosure requirements could subject us to financial penalties from the DOE and heightened the risk of potential federal and private misrepresentation claims.\nMoreover, in the event we are found not to be in compliance with a state\u2019s new or existing requirements for offering distance education within that state, the state could seek to restrict one or more of our business activities within its boundaries, we may not be able to recruit students from that state, and we may have to cease providing service to students in that state. In addition, a state may impose penalties on an institution for failure to comply with state requirements related to an institution\u2019s activities in a state, including the delivery of distance education to persons in that state. In addition, if Aspen University is unable to re-join or is found not to be in compliance with applicable eligibility criteria, including requirements related to financial responsibility that require institutions to maintain a composite score of 1.0 or higher, Aspen University could become ineligible to participate in interstate reciprocity programs such as SARA. Even if Aspen University again participates in SARA as discussed on Page 8, if Aspen University fails to meet such eligibility criteria and can no longer participate in SARA or similar programs, Aspen University would need to comply with each state\u2019s requirements for offering distance education in that state, which could lead to disruptions in enrollments and operations and additional costs while Aspen University obtains any necessary authorizations. Further, the required criteria could be altered in a manner rendering it more costly or difficult for us to comply, which would jeopardize our ability to operate as we have historically or as planned.\nIf the DOE determines that borrowers of federal student loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their federal student loans, our institution\u2019s repayment liability to the DOE could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations.\nThe DOE\u2019s 2016 BDTR regulations, effective for federal Direct Loans disbursed between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2020, as well as the new 2019 BDTR Rule, effective for loans disbursed after July 1, 2020, as well as the anticipated 2022 version of the BDTR, provide borrowers of loans under the Direct Loan program a defense against repayment under certain circumstances outlined in each rule. In the event the borrower\u2019s defense against repayment is successful, DOE has the authority to discharge all or part of the student\u2019s obligation to repay the loan and may require the institution to repay to DOE the amount of the loan to which the defense applies.\nUnder the 2016 BDTR Rule, there are three grounds for a borrower defense to repayment claim, for loans disbursed between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020: (1) the student borrower obtained a state or federal court judgment against the institution; (2) the institution failed to perform on a contract with the student; and/or (3) the institution committed a \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d on which the borrower reasonably relied to his or her detriment. Claims based on a court judgment or claims to assert a defense against loan payments that are still due can be made any time (with no statute of limitations), while other claims (such as to recoup loan funds already repaid to DOE) must be made within six years. For loans disbursed after July 1, 2020, the basis for a BDTR claim will be limited to a misrepresentation claim, under the DOE\u2019s 2020 definition, and generally, the claim must be made within three years of the borrower\u2019s last date of enrollment. As noted under \u201cRegulations\u201d on page 13, the 2022 version of the Rule is currently with OIRA/OMB and is not public. However, based on information available to us regarding the 2021 negotiations we believe that the new BDTR rule will likely expand the bases for borrower claims to include the original three bases from the 2016 BDTR Rule, as well as additional bases. Additionally, DOE indicated it wanted to apply the new BDTR rules to all borrower defense claims to alleviate the challenge of trying to process claims under multiple versions of the Rule. The DOE also indicated it planned to update definitions, reinstitute the group claim process, and remove all statutes of limitations on borrower claims, as long as borrowers still have an outstanding balance on a Direct Loan.\nClaim resolution process: Under the 2016 Rule, the DOE has also given itself authority to process claims on a group basis, and to take the initiative to create groups and include borrowers who have not filed a claim. Borrowers who file successful claims may have their loans forgiven in whole or in part, with the DOE reserving the right to calculate the amount of forgiveness in various ways. As noted above, the 2019 BDTR Rule removed the group claim option, and the discussion proposal provided during negotiated rulemaking in late 2021 would add the group claim process back into the Rule.\nFor debts relieved for individual borrowers, the prior regulations and the pending proposal give the DOE the authority to initiate a proceeding to seek repayment from the institution for any loan amounts forgiven.\nIf the DOE determines that borrowers of Direct Loan program loans who attended Aspen University or USU have a defense to repayment of their Direct Loan program loans based on our acts or omissions, the repayment liability to the DOE could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, excessive BDTR claims could become a \u201cfinancial trigger\u201d under the Financial Responsibility regulations, based on the proposal discussed during negotiated rulemaking. In such circumstances, the DOE could determine that we are not financially responsible, resulting in a requirement that we post an additional letter of credit, possible negative impacts on the status of our Title IV program participation agreement, additional reporting, growth limitations, and a change to a more stringent funding process, such as Heightened Cash Monitoring II or \u201creimbursement.\u201d\nThe financial responsibility regulations include numerous operational or financial events that would potentially indicate that the institution will have difficulty meeting its financial or administrative obligations. If one of the enumerated triggering events\noccur, the institution is required to report to DOE according to the reporting requirements included in the regulation. We fully expect the list of triggers will grow substantially in the anticipated 2022 BDTR Rule.\nFor certain of the triggers, the DOE assesses the potential liability or fiscal impact reported and recalculates the institution\u2019s composite score. If the institution\u2019s composite score drops below 1.0, the DOE may require the institution to provide additional surety to continue Title IV participation. The regulations (both current and expected) also include \u201cdiscretionary trigger\u201d events or conditions that institutions must report, and which the DOE will review to determine whether they are reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on the institution\u2019s fiscal or operational condition.\nIf based on these events and the DOE\u2019s assessment, it is determined that the institution is not financially responsible, DOE will require the institution to become provisionally certified and post a letter of credit in an amount specified, generally at least 10% of the Title IV funds received in the most recent fiscal year. The institution and the DOE may also agree to an offset of the institution's future Title IV funds for six to 12 months until the DOE is able to capture the amount of the surety required.\nIf Aspen University or USU were to experience an event that the DOE determines is an indication that either institution is not financially responsible, we could be forced to post letter(s) of credit which could have material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe 2016 BDTR Rule had included a prohibition on mandatory pre-dispute arbitration clauses and class action waivers as means to resolve a borrower defense-related claim (meaning related to the making of a Direct Loan or the educational services for which the Direct Loan was issued). Under the 2016 Rule, institutions were required to amend their arbitration and class action waiver agreements to include mandatory DOE language, and to provide notice to students under previous (non-compliant) versions of these agreements that the institution would not compel the borrower to arbitrate their claim or waive the right to join a class action for similar types of claims. Students who borrowed through the Direct Loan program between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020 cannot be compelled to bring an action in arbitration or waive their right to be a member of a class action lawsuit against Aspen University or USU, if the basis of the borrower\u2019s claim is rooted in the making of the Direct Loan or the educational services it paid for. In addition, under the 2016 Rule, institutions were required to report and provide DOE with arbitral and judicial records when a student files a borrower defense-related claim.\nUnder the 2019 BDTR Rule, which became effective on July 1, 2020, pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers are no longer prohibited. Institutions that opt to use these types of agreements will be required to provide \u201cplain language\u201d disclosures that explain arbitration and class action, and make those disclosures publicly available on the institution\u2019s admission webpage.\nDuring the 2021 negotiated rulemaking, the DOE indicated its intent to reinstate the 2016 prohibition on the use of pre-dispute arbitration and class actions waivers as enrollment contract conditions. It is unclear whether this proposal was included in the packages that have been sent to OIRA/OMB, as it was negotiated separately instead of as an element of the BDTR rules, as had been the case in prior rounds.\nIf we fail to maintain our institutional accreditations, we would lose our ability to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the U.S. Armed Forces and also to participate in Title IV Programs.\nAspen University is accredited by the DEAC and USU is accredited by WSCUC. Both the DEAC and WSCUC are institutional accreditors and recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education for Title IV purposes. Accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Secretary of Education is required for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs as well as in the tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces. The DEAC or WSCUC may impose restrictions on our accreditation or may terminate our accreditation. To remain accredited, we must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty qualification, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. Failure to meet any of these criteria or standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the accrediting agency. The loss of accreditation would, among other things, render our students and us ineligible to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the U.S. Armed Forces or Title IV Programs and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations. In addition, although the loss of accreditation by one school would not necessarily result in the loss of accreditation by the other school, the accreditor may consider the loss of accreditation by one school as a factor in considering the on-going qualification for accreditation of the other school.\nBecause we participate in Title IV Programs, our failure to comply with the complex regulations associated with Title IV Programs would have a significant adverse effect on our operations and prospects for growth.\nAspen University and USU participate in Title IV Programs. Compliance with the requirements of the Higher Education Act and Title IV Programs is highly complex and imposes significant additional regulatory requirements on our operations, which require additional staff, contractual arrangements, systems and regulatory costs. We have a limited demonstrated history of compliance with these additional regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with any of these additional regulatory requirements, the DOE could, among other things, impose monetary penalties, place limitations on our ability to access Title IV funds, and/or condition or terminate the eligibility of one or both of our schools to receive Title IV Program funds, which would limit our potential for growth and materiality and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations. In addition, the failure to comply with the Title IV Program requirements by one institution could increase the DOE's scrutiny of the other institution and could impact the other institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs.\nWe must regularly reestablish our eligibility and certification to participate in the Title IV Programs, and there are no assurances that the DOE will recertify us to participate in the Title IV Programs.\nAn institution generally must seek re-certification from the DOE at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors. In certain circumstances, the DOE provisionally certifies an institution to participate in Title IV Programs, such as when it is an initial participant in Title IV Programs or has undergone a change in ownership and control.\nOn May 14, 2019, United States University was granted temporary provisional approval to participate in the Title IV Programs and had a program participation agreement reapplication date of December 31, 2020, which it met. As part of the provisional approval, USU posted a letter of credit in the amount of $255,708 which was funded by AGI. USU was notified that amount would be reduced to $9,872 and that the reduced amount would remain in effect for the duration of the provisional approval. On May 6, 2022, the DOE fully certified USU and issued a new Program Participation Agreement, effective through December 31, 2025, thereby removing the provisional status of its participation. USU is working with the DOE to address the outstanding LOC.\nUnder provisional certification, an institution must obtain prior DOE approval to add an educational program or make other significant changes and may be subject to closer scrutiny by the DOE. In addition, if the DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities to comply with the Title IV requirements, the DOE may revoke the institution\u2019s certification to participate in the Title IV Programs without advance notice or opportunity to challenge the action.\nIf the DOE does not ultimately approve an institution's recertification to participate in Title IV Programs, students would no longer be able to receive Title IV Program funds. If this scenario were to affect us, it would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenues and results of operations. In addition, regulatory restraints related to the addition of new programs or substantive change of existing programs or imposition of an additional letter of credit could impair our ability to attract and retain students and could negatively affect our financial results.\nBecause the DOE may conduct compliance reviews of us, we may be subject to adverse actions and future litigation which could affect our ability to offer Title IV student loans.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of non-compliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies, and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. If the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties, including the requirement to make refunds. Even if we adequately address issues raised by any compliance review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit.\nIf the percentage of our revenues derived from Title IV Programs is too high, we could lose our ability to participate in Title IV Programs.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, an institution is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs if, on a cash accounting basis, it derives more than 90% of its fiscal year revenue from Title IV Program funds, for two consecutive fiscal years. This rule is known as the 90/10 rule. Our online programs are well below this threshold due to our monthly payment plans. However, our BSN Pre-Licensure hybrid campus/online nursing program tuition is too high to justify use of our monthly payment plans.\nAn institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year is placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to other conditions specified by the U.S. Secretary of Education. We must monitor compliance with the 90/10 rule by both Aspen University and USU. Failure to comply with the 90/10 rule for one fiscal year may result in restrictions on the amounts of Title IV funds that may be distributed to students; restrictions on expansion; requirements related to letters of credit or any other restrictions imposed by the DOE. Failure to comply with the 90/10 rule for one year is also considered a triggering event under the BDTR Rules. Additionally, if we fail to comply with the 90/10 rule for two consecutive years, we will be ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs and any disbursements of Title IV Program funds made while ineligible must be repaid to the DOE.\nThe 90/10 Rule was recently changed as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\u201cARP\u201d), but the effective date of this change is not yet established. Under a provision in ARP, the HEA would be modified to change the formula from counting only Title IV program funds on the \u201c90 side\u201d to include instead all \u2018\u2018federal funds that are disbursed or delivered to or on behalf of a student to be used to attend such institution\u201d or collectively \u201cfederal education assistance funds.\u201d This is a substantial change, and the impact is not entirely clear, in part because it is unclear whether other federal funds, such as Department of Defense Military Tuition Assistance program, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and Trade Adjustment Assistance, will be included in the new definition, despite not being discussed as an impetus for the change. In the final language of the ARP, the new 90/10 provision will be subject to negotiated rulemaking after October 2021, with an earliest effective date in fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2023.\nThe 90/10 Rule was one of the few items during the 2021/2022 Negotiated Rulemaking that reached consensus; however, the proposed rule is currently with OIRA/OMB and is not yet public. The changes agreed to by the negotiators did not clearly address how federal funds through programs outside of those available to veterans and the military would be counted, but it was clear that the intent is for GI Bill and any funds provided by the Department of Defense to be moved to the \u201c90 side\u201d of the equation.\nDue to scrutiny of the sector, legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress that would revise the requirements of the 90/10 rule to be stricter, including proposals that would reduce the 90% maximum under the rule to 85%. Despite the recent change in ARP, it is possible that additional legislative proposals could further amend the 90/10 rule.\nIf our competitors are subject to further regulatory claims and adverse publicity, it may affect our industry and reduce our future enrollment.\nWe are one of a number of for-profit institutions serving the postsecondary education market. In recent years, regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several companies that own for-profit educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and non-compliance with the DOE regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. Although the media, regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against specific companies, broader allegations against the overall for-profit school sector may negatively affect public perceptions of other for-profit educational institutions, including Aspen University and USU. In addition, in recent years, reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools, including for-profit schools, and investigations by a number of state attorneys general, Congress and governmental agencies have led to adverse media coverage of postsecondary education. For example, large competitors such as ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges sold or shut down their schools due to substantial regulatory investigations and the DOE actions. Adverse media coverage regarding other companies in the for-profit school sector or regarding Aspen University or USU directly could damage our reputation, could result in lower enrollments, revenues and operating profit, and could have a negative impact on our stock price. Such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the DOE, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures or other governmental authorities with respect to all for-profit institutions, including Aspen University and USU.\nDue to new regulations or congressional action or reduction in funding for Title IV Programs, our future enrollment may be reduced and costs of compliance increased.\nThe Higher Education Act comes up for reauthorization by Congress approximately every five to six years. When Congress does not act on complete reauthorization, there are typically amendments and extensions of authorization. Additionally, Congress reviews and determines appropriations for Title IV Programs on an annual basis through the budget and appropriations process. There is no assurance that Congress will not in the future enact changes that decrease Title IV Program funds available to students, including students who attend our institutions. Any action by Congress that significantly reduces funding for Title IV Programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs would require us to arrange for other sources of financial aid and would materially decrease our enrollment. Such a decrease in enrollment would\nhave a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Congressional action may also require us to modify our practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margin.\nFurther, there has been growing regulatory action and investigations of for-profit companies that offer online education. We are not in a position to predict with certainty whether any legislation will be passed by Congress or signed into law in the future. The reallocation of funding among Title IV Programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different Title IV Programs could reduce the ability of students to finance their education at our institutions and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIf our efforts to comply with the DOE regulations are inconsistent with how the DOE interprets those provisions, either due to insufficient time to implement the necessary changes, uncertainty about the meaning of the rules, or otherwise, we may be found to be in noncompliance with such provisions and the DOE could impose monetary penalties, place limitations on our ability to access Title IV funds, and/or condition or terminate the eligibility of our schools to receive Title IV Program funds. We cannot predict with certainty the effect the new and impending regulatory provisions will have on our business.\nBecause we are subject to sanctions if we fail to calculate correctly and return timely Title IV Program funds for students who stop participating before completing their educational program, our future operating results may be adversely affected.\nA school participating in Title IV Programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw or reduce their enrollment status in their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. Under the DOE regulations, institutions that use the last day of attendance in an academically related activity must determine the relevant date based on accurate institutional records (not a student\u2019s certificate of attendance). This definition was further refined in the September 2, 2020, Final Rule and for online classes, \u201cacademic attendance\u201d means engaging in an academically-related activity, such as participating in an asynchronous class through an online discussion, a study group, an interactive tutorial, or initiating contact with a faculty member to ask an academic question; simply logging into an online class does not constitute \u201cacademic attendance\u201d for purposes of the return of funds requirements or engagement in an academic course. The September 2, 2020 Final Rule also included an update to the determination of a withdrawn student and the calculation of a refund under a term-based modular calendar. Under the DOE regulations, late return of Title IV Program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in connection with the institution\u2019s annual compliance audit or a program review constitutes material non-compliance. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned, we may have to repay Title IV funds, post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE or otherwise be sanctioned by the DOE, which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations. This may have an impact on our systems, our future operations and cash flows. There is a risk that there may be a misinterpretation of these new rules resulting in late or incorrectly calculated refunds. After we acquired USU, we learned that its predecessor failed to comply with the prior Rule. As a result, we were required to post a $71,634 letter of credit which has been reduced to $9,872.\nIf we fail to ensure that the delivery of our distance education programs supports regular and substantive interaction between students and instructors, our distance education programs could be considered \u201ccorrespondence courses\u201d which could make those programs ineligible to participate in the Title IV Programs.\nThe DOE distinguishes between distance education and correspondence courses. Distance education involves the delivery of instruction to students who are separated from the instructor, which supports regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor, and this is a key distinguishing feature of a distance education course. Correspondence courses do not involve regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor. An institution is not eligible to participate in the Title IV Programs if 50% or more of its students were enrolled in correspondence courses or more than 50% of its courses are correspondence during its latest completed award year, making it important for the schools\u2019 distance education to involve regular and substantive interaction. If Aspen and USU distance education courses do not include sufficient documented regular and substantive interaction, they could be considered correspondence courses, and we would need to refund all Title IV aid received by the university back to the start of the award year after the 50% threshold was reached.\nNew regulations focused on regular and substantive interaction, as well as other elements of distance education, became effective on July 1, 2021. Included in those regulations were updated definitions, including an amendment to the definition of distance education, and examples of what the DOE will consider sufficiently regular, i.e. scheduled, interactions with faculty, academic engagement, and assessment and monitoring of student success. The updates did not require us to make material changes to our programs or delivery methodology.\nIf we fail to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility,\u201d Aspen University and USU may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs or be required to post a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nTo participate in Title IV Programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the DOE, or post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions, such as additional reporting requirements or regulatory oversight, on its participation in Title IV Programs. Effective July 1, 2020, the DOE has updated the triggering events and factors it considers when evaluating whether an institution is financially responsible, which may render compliance more difficult or costly in the future, and we expect that the current rulemaking process will yield additional factors that the DOE will consider in its assessment of financial responsibility; however, as noted above, the financial responsibility regulatory package is not expected to be completed in time for a July 2023 effective date. The DOE may also apply its measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution and, if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities, require the institution to meet alternative standards for continued participation in the Title IV Programs. Any of these alternative standards would increase our costs of regulatory compliance. If we were unable to meet these alternative standards, we would lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. If we fail to demonstrate financial responsibility and thus lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, our students would lose access to Title IV Program funds for use in our institutions, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.\nIf we fail to demonstrate \u201cadministrative capability,\u201d we may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nThe DOE regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to participate in Title IV Programs. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other DOE regulations, the DOE may require the repayment of Title IV funds, transfer the institution from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV funds to cash monitoring status or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d system of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV Programs.\nAdministrative capability was also a topic in the 2021/2022 rulemaking process. The issue paper discussed by negotiators included substantial updates to these provisions, including additional requirements around financial aid counseling and disbursement of funds, compliance with other areas of the HEA and Title IV regulations such as GE, BDTR, and 90/10, ensuring appropriate documentation of high school completion, ensuring sufficient clinical placements for students requiring such training, and offering career services to students enrolled in GE programs. This package is not yet at OIRA/OMB, as far as we know, and any text developed for a proposed rule is not yet public. We expect the DOE will try to submit this proposed rule to the appropriate White Offices soon, in an attempt to meet the Master Calendar timeline.\nIf we are found not to have satisfied the DOE\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements, we could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV Program funding, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on third parties to assist us in administering our participation in Title IV Programs, their failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause one or both of our schools to lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nWe rely on third-party assistance to comply with the complex administration of participation in Title IV Programs for our schools. Third parties assist us with the administration of our participation in Title IV Programs, and if one or both do not comply with applicable regulations, we may be liable for their actions and we could lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. In addition, if the third-party servicers are no longer able to provide their services to us, we may not be able to replace one or both in a timely or cost-efficient manner, or at all, and we could lose our ability to comply with the requirements of Title IV Programs, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenues and results of operation.\nIf we pay impermissible commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in recruiting, admissions or financial aid activities, we will be subject to sanctions.\nA school participating in Title IV Programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based, directly or indirectly, on success in enrolling students or securing financial aid to any person involved in student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. If we pay a bonus, commission, or other incentive payment in violation of applicable DOE rules, we could be subject to sanctions, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business. The incentive payment rule and related uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted also may influence our approach, or limit our alternatives, with respect to employment policies and practices and consequently may affect negatively our ability to recruit and retain employees, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the GAO has issued a report critical of the DOE\u2019s enforcement of the incentive payment rule, and the DOE has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts. If the DOE determines that an institution violated the incentive payment rule, it may require the institution to modify its payment arrangements to the DOE\u2019s satisfaction. The DOE may also fine the institution or initiate action to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs. The DOE may also seek to recover Title IV funds disbursed in connection with the prohibited incentive payments. In addition, third parties may file \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suits on behalf of the DOE alleging violation of the incentive payment provision. Such suits may prompt the DOE investigations. Particularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding the incentive payment rule, the existence of, the costs of responding to, and the outcome of, qui tam or whistleblower suits or the DOE investigations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation causing our enrollments to decline and could cause us to incur costs that are material to our business, among other things. As a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf their student loan default rates are too high, our schools may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nThe DOE regulations provide that an institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs ends when historical default rates reach a certain level in a single year or for a number of years. Because of our limited experience enrolling students who are participating in these programs, we have limited historical default rate information. Relatively few students are expected to enter the repayment phase in the near term, which could result in defaults by a few students having a relatively large impact on our default rate. If Aspen University or USU loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs because of high student loan default rates, our students would no longer be eligible to use Title IV Program funds in our institution, which would significantly reduce our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, high default rates were included in the updated list of \u201cfinancial triggers\u201d as well as an element of administrative capability, discussed during negotiated rulemaking.\nIf either institutional accrediting agency loses recognition by the U.S. Secretary of Education or we fail to maintain institutional accreditation for Aspen University and USU, we may lose our ability to participate in Title IV Programs.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny of accrediting agencies and their accreditation of universities is likely to continue. While Aspen University and USU are each accredited by a DOE-recognized accrediting body, if the DOE were to limit, suspend, or terminate either accreditor\u2019s recognition that institution could lose its ability to participate in the Title IV Programs. If we were unable to rely on accreditation in such circumstances, among other things, our students and our institution would be ineligible to participate in the Title IV Programs, and such consequence would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenues and results of operations. In addition, increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the Secretary of Education in connection with the DOE\u2019s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accrediting agencies.\nFurthermore, based on continued scrutiny of the for-profit education sector, it is possible that accrediting bodies will respond by adopting additional criteria, standards and policies that are intended to monitor, regulate or limit the growth of for-profit institutions like Aspen University and USU. Actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including any change in the legal status, form of control, or ownership/management of the institution, any significant changes in the institution\u2019s financial position, or any significant growth or decline in enrollment and/or programs, could open up an accredited institution to additional reviews by the applicable accreditor.\nIf we fail to comply with the DOE\u2019s substantial misrepresentation rules, it could result in sanctions against our schools.\nThe DOE may take action against an institution in the event of substantial misrepresentation by the institution concerning the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. In 2011, the DOE expanded the activities that constitute a substantial misrepresentation. Under the DOE regulations, an institution engages in substantial misrepresentation when the institution itself, one of its representatives, or an organization or person with which the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, marketing, advertising, or admissions services, makes a substantial misrepresentation directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency, or to the Secretary of Education. The regulations define misrepresentation as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, and they define a misleading statement as any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse. The regulations define substantial misrepresentation as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to the person\u2019s detriment. If the DOE determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the DOE may revoke an institution\u2019s program participation agreement, impose limitations on an institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs, deny participation applications made on behalf of\nthe institution, or initiate a proceeding against the institution to fine the institution or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs. We expect that there could be an increase in our industry of administrative actions and litigation claiming substantial misrepresentation, which at a minimum would increase legal costs associated with defending such actions, and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with the DOE\u2019s credit hour requirements, it could result in sanctions against our schools.\nThe DOE has defined \u201ccredit hour\" for Title IV purposes. However, the definition of a credit hour is different for degree and non-degree programs that do not transfer to a degree. The credit hour is used for Title IV purposes to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV aid that an institution may disburse for students in a particular program. The regulations define credit hour for a degree program as an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates certain specified time in class and out of class and an equivalent amount of work for other academic activities, which may be reviewed by the institution's accreditor. For non-degree programs that do not transfer to a degree program, the DOE regulations provide a specific formula for the calculation of a credit hour based on the number of clock hours in a course. The DOE has indicated that if it finds an institution to be out of compliance with the credit hour definition for Title IV purposes, it may require the institution to repay the amount of Title IV awarded under the incorrect assignment of credit hours and, if it finds significant overstatement of credit hours, it may fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in Title IV Programs, the result of which could be that our business is materially and adversely affected.\nThe Final Rule issued on September 2, 2020, effective as of July 1, 2021, included a new formula to calculate the credit hours eligible for Title IV funding for non-degree programs that do not transfer to a degree. Aspen University and USU do not have programs eligible for Title IV funding that do not lead to a degree and this rule change has no impact.\nThe U.S. Congress continues to examine the for-profit postsecondary education sector which could result in legislation or additional DOE rulemaking that may limit or condition Title IV Program participation of proprietary schools in a manner that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress has increased its focus on for-profit education institutions, including with respect to their participation in the Title IV Programs, and has held hearings regarding such matters. In addition, the GAO released a series of reports following undercover investigations critical of for-profit institutions. We cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, these hearings and reports will result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting our participation in Title IV Programs, or more vigorous enforcement of Title IV requirements. Moreover, with the HEA pending reauthorization a new administration, political considerations could impact Title IV funding as well as the treatment of for-profit education in future legislation. As noted above, the Biden administration has formulated a very aggressive schedule of rulemaking in 2021 and 2022, with the intent to rewrite the numerous regulations.\nTo the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition Title IV Program participation of proprietary schools or the amount of federal student financial aid for which proprietary school students are eligible, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with the federal campus safety and security reporting requirements as implemented by the DOE would result in sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nWe must comply with certain campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1990 (the \u201cClery Act\u201d), as amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. The Clery Act requires an institution to report to the DOE and disclose in its annual safety and security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred within the institution\u2019s so-called \u201cClery geography.\u201d As we expand to new campus locations, our efforts to comply with the Clery Act will become more costly and the risk of noncompliance will increase. Failure to comply with the Clery Act requirements or regulations promulgated by the DOE could result in fines or suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, could lead to litigation, or could harm our reputation, each of which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although not related to educational regulations, we must comply with state and local social distancing and pandemic related regulations and orders. These requirements may increase our expenses.\nGeneral Risks\nDue to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile.\nAny of the following factors could affect the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022Our failure to solve our liquidity risks;\n\u2022Our failure to resolve our Arizona regulatory issues;\n\u2022A decline in our growth rate including new student enrollments and class starts;\n\u2022Our failure to generate increasing material revenues;\n\u2022Our failure to meet our forecasts relating to our future operating performance;\n\u2022Our failure to meet financial analysts\u2019 performance expectations;\n\u2022Changes in earnings estimates and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022Our public disclosure of the terms of any financing which we consummate in the future;\n\u2022Disclosure of the results of our monthly payment plan and collections;\n\u2022A decline in the economy which impacts our ability to collect our accounts receivable;\n\u2022Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new services, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022The loss of Title IV funding or other regulatory actions;\n\u2022The sale of large numbers of shares of common stock by our officers, directors or other shareholders;\n\u2022Short selling activities;\n\u2022Any future non-compliance with Nasdaq rules or actions taken by the company in response; or\n\u2022Changes in market valuations of similar companies.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business.\nBecause we may issue preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders and have other anti-takeover defenses, it may be more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and could depress our stock price.\nOur Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) may issue, without a vote of our shareholders, one or more additional series of preferred stock that have more than one vote per share. This could permit our Board to issue preferred stock to investors who support us and our management and give effective control of our business to our management. Additionally, issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in our stock price and a decline in interest of our common stock. This could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common stock. This could also cause the market price of our common stock shares to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.", "PERMNO": 16856, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "ASPU"}
