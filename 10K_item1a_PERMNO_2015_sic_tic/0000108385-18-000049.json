{"cik": "108385", "company": "WORLD ACCEPTANCE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-06-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report contains various \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions, as well as information currently available to management. Statements other than those of historical fact, as well as those identified by the use of words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \"intend,\" \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d and any variations of the foregoing and similar expressions, are forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Any such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual financial results, performance or financial condition may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, expected or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nInvestors should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented in this annual report and the other reports and registration statements the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks, uncertainties, and possibly inaccurate assumptions underlying our plans and expectations, could result in harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline, which in turn could cause investors to lose all or part of their investment in our Company. These factors, among others, could also cause actual results to differ materially from those we have experienced in the past or those we may express or imply from time to time in any forward-looking statements we make. Investors are advised that it is impossible to identify or predict all risks, and that risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also could affect us in the future. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements it may make.\nFederal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are adverse to our operations or result in adverse regulatory proceedings, or our failure to comply with existing or future federal laws and regulations, could force us to modify, suspend or cease part or all of our nationwide operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal laws and regulations that affect our lending operations. Although these laws and regulations have remained substantially unchanged for many years, the laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities have been under review and subject to change in recent years as a result of various developments and changes in economic conditions, the make-up of the executive and legislative branches of government, and the political and media focus on issues of consumer and borrower protection. Any changes in such laws and regulations could force us to modify, suspend or cease part or, in the worst case, all of our existing operations. It is also possible that the scope of federal regulations could change or expand in such a way as to preempt what has traditionally been state law regulation of our business activities.\nIn July 2010 the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act restructured and enhanced the regulation and supervision of the financial services industry and created the CFPB, an agency with sweeping regulatory and enforcement authority over consumer financial transactions. Although the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits the CFPB from setting interest rates on consumer loans, efforts to create a federal usury cap, applicable to all consumer credit transactions and substantially below rates at which the Company could continue to operate profitably, are still ongoing. Any federal legislative or regulatory action that severely restricts or prohibits the provision of small-loan consumer credit and similar services on terms substantially similar to those we currently provide would, if enacted, have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Any federal law that would impose a 36% or similar annualized credit rate cap on our services would, if enacted, almost certainly eliminate our ability to continue our current operations. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which various expected provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been and are expected to continue to be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through\nregulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations remains unclear; however, these regulations have increased and are expected to further increase our cost of doing business and time spent by management on regulatory matters, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and results.\nThe CFPB\u2019s rulemaking and enforcement authority extends to certain non-depository institutions, including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies providing consumer financial products or services and their service providers from engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce, and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to our business. Further, the CFPB has authority to designate non-depository \u201clarger participants\u201d in certain markets for consumer financial services and products for purposes of the CFPB\u2019s supervisory authority under the Dodd-Frank Act. Such designated \u201clarger participants\u201d are subject to reporting and on-site compliance examinations by the CFPB, which may result in increased compliance costs and potentially greater enforcement risks based on these supervisory activities. Although the CFPB has not yet developed a \u201clarger participant\u201d rule that directly covers the Company\u2019s installment lending business, in June 2016 the CFPB stated that it expects to conduct separate rulemaking to identify larger participants in the installment lending market for purposes of its supervision program. Though the timing of any such rulemaking is uncertain, the Company believes that the implementation of such rules would likely bring the Company\u2019s business under the CFPB\u2019s direct supervisory authority.\nOn June 2, 2016, the CFPB announced proposed rules under its unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices rulemaking authority relating to payday, vehicle title, and similar loans. The proposal would cover short-term loans with a contractual term of 45 days or less, as well as \u201clonger-term loans\u201d with a term of longer than 45 days with an all-in annualized percentage rate of interest (\u201cAPR\u201d) in excess of 36% in which the lender has either a non-purchase money security interest in the consumer\u2019s vehicle or the right to collect repayment from the consumer\u2019s bank account or paycheck. The CFPB\u2019s \u201clonger-term\u201d credit proposals seek to address a concern that consumers suffer harm if lenders fail to reasonably underwrite loans but take a security interest in the consumer\u2019s vehicle or access to repayment from a consumer\u2019s account or wages. Although the Company does not make loans with terms of 45 days or less or obtain access to a customer\u2019s bank account or paycheck for repayment of any of its loans, it does make some vehicle-secured loans with an APR within the scope of the proposal. The proposals would require a lender, as a condition of making a covered longer-term loan, to first make a good-faith reasonable determination that the consumer has the ability to repay the covered longer-term loan without reborrowing or defaulting. The proposals would require a lender to consider and verify the amount and timing of the consumer's income, the consumer's major financial obligations, and the consumer's borrowing history prior to making a covered loan. Lenders would also be required to determine that a consumer is able to make all projected payments under the covered longer-term loan as those payments are due, while still fulfilling other major financial obligations and meeting living expenses. This ability to repay assessment would apply to both the initial longer-term loan and to any subsequent refinancing. In addition, the proposals would include a rebuttable presumption that customers seeking to refinance a covered longer-term loan lack an \u201cability to repay\u201d if at the time of refinancing: (i) the borrower was delinquent by more than seven days or had recently been delinquent on an outstanding loan within the past 30 days; (ii) the borrower stated or indicated an inability to make a scheduled payment within the past 30 days; (iii) the refinancing would result in the first scheduled payment to be due in a longer period of time than between the time of refinancing the loan and the next regularly scheduled payment on the outstanding loan; or (iv) the refinancing would not provide the consumer a disbursement of funds or an amount that would not substantially exceed the amount of payment due on the outstanding loan within 30 days of refinancing. To overcome this presumption of inability to repay, the lender would have to verify an improvement in the borrower\u2019s financial capacity to indicate an ability to repay the additional extension of credit. These proposals are subject to possible change before any final rules would be issued and implemented, and we cannot predict what the ultimate rulemaking will provide. The Company does not believe that these proposals as currently described by the CFPB would have a material impact on the Company\u2019s existing lending procedures, because the Company currently underwrites all its loans (including those secured by a vehicle title that would fall within the scope of these proposals) by reviewing the customer\u2019s ability to repay based on the Company\u2019s standards. However, there can be no assurance that these proposals for longer-term loans, if and when implemented in final rulemaking, would not require changes to the Company\u2019s practices and procedures for such loans that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to make such loans, the cost of making such loans, the Company\u2019s ability to, or frequency with which it could, refinance any such loans, and the profitability of such loans. Any final rulemaking also could have effects beyond those contemplated in the initial proposal that could further materially and adversely impact our business and operations.\nIn addition to the specific matters described above, other aspects of our business may be the subject of future CFPB rulemaking. The enactment of one or more of such regulatory changes, or the exercise of broad regulatory authority by regulators, including but not limited to, the CFPB, having jurisdiction over the Company\u2019s business or discretionary consumer financial transactions generically, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\u201d for more information regarding legislation we are subject to and related risks.\nWe have experienced significant turnover in our senior management, and our business may be adversely affected by the transitions in our senior management team or by our inability to effectively handle our leadership transition and any future succession planning.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a separation agreement with our then-serving Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, and in January 2018, we entered into a separation agreement with our then-serving President and Chief Executive Officer. The employment of these officers with the Company has terminated. On January 22, 2018, our Board of Directors appointed James H. Wanserski to serve as our interim President and Chief Executive Officer while the Board searches for a permanent replacement. There can be no assurances concerning the timing or outcome of the Company\u2019s search for permanent replacements.\nExecutive leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause disruption to our business. As a result of recent executive turnover, our existing management team has taken on substantially more responsibility, which has resulted in greater workload demands and could divert their attention away from certain key areas of our business. In addition, management transition inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge, which can negatively affect strategy and execution, and our results of operations and financial condition could be negative impacted as a result. The loss of services of one or more other members of senior management, or the inability to attract qualified permanent replacements, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to successfully attract and appoint permanent replacements with the appropriate expertise, we could experience increased employee turnover and harm to our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. The search for permanent replacements could also result in significant recruiting and relocation costs.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA, and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business and liquidity.\nWe are subject to the FCPA and various other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. We face significant risks and liability if we fail to comply with these laws, which generally prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties or candidates, employees of public international organizations, or private-sector recipients for the corrupt purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. As discussed in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings-Mexico Investigation,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to conduct an investigation of certain transactions and payments in Mexico that potentially implicate the Company in violations of the FCPA, including the books and records provisions of the FCPA. In addition, we have informed the DOJ and the SEC of these matters and intend to fully cooperate with these agencies in their review and investigation. The SEC has issued a formal order of investigation in connection with these matters.\nIf violations of the FCPA occurred, the Company could be subject to fines, civil and criminal penalties, equitable remedies, including profit disgorgement and related interest, and injunctive relief. In addition, any disposition of these matters could adversely impact the Company's access to debt financing and capital funding, as well as our ability to collect on outstanding loans and result in further modifications to our business practices and compliance programs, including significant restructuring or curtailment of our operations in Mexico. Any disposition could also potentially require that a monitor be appointed to review future business practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the FCPA and other applicable laws. The Company could also face fines, sanctions, and other penalties from authorities in Mexico, as well as third-party claims by shareholders and/or other stakeholders of the Company.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving these matters is expensive and consumes significant time and attention of the Company\u2019s senior management. While we are currently unable to predict what actions the DOJ, SEC, or other governmental agencies (including governmental agencies in Mexico) might take, or what the likely outcome of any such actions might be, we may incur substantial additional expenses responding to such actions. In addition, such actions, fines, and/or penalties could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and its ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from its current customers and potential customers, to attract and retain employees, and to access the capital markets. If it is determined that a violation of the FCPA has occurred, such violation, or a settlement thereof, may give rise to an event of default under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors-We depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to fund our liquidity needs\u201d and \u201c-The terms of our debt limit how we conduct business.\u201d\nOur investigation of our operations in Mexico may expose the Company to other potential liabilities in addition to any potential liabilities under the FCPA and cause the Company to incur substantial expenses.\nIn addition to the FCPA implications of our internal investigation into our Mexico operations, as described in the preceding risk factor, our internal investigation may also uncover other material violations of federal and local laws, including but not limited to\nviolations of tax laws and regulations. Any such violations could expose us to lawsuits and other liabilities under applicable law and have a material adverse effect on our business, including our operations in Mexico and our decisions with respect thereto, and our liquidity. Investigating, uncovering, and resolving these matters is expensive and continues to consume significant time and attention of the Company\u2019s senior management. In addition, we may incur substantial additional expenses responding to potential lawsuits and the results thereof could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients, to attract and retain employees, and to access the capital markets.\nOur operations in Mexico are subject to the risks inherent in conducting operations internationally and could contribute materially to increased costs and negatively affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations in Mexico accounted for 8.4% of our revenues during fiscal 2018 and 9.1% of our gross loans receivable at March 31, 2018 and expose our business to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including potential FCPA compliance risks, currency fluctuations and devaluations, unsettled political and social conditions, communication and translation errors due to language barriers, compliance with differing legal and regulatory regimes and differing cultural attitudes toward regulation and compliance. In particular, political and social unrest in Mexico, coupled with a unionized labor structure that effectively gives third parties control over repayment of funds remitted from our customers who borrow under our payroll deduction loan product in Mexico, create risks of non-payment or delinquent payment of these funds collected through the third parties. If we are unable to resolve any such possible issues and persuade the third parties to remit these types of payments, our revenues, delinquencies and charge-off rates from our Mexican operations could be materially and adversely affected. Further, any suspension, cessation or curtailment of our operations in Mexico would decrease our revenues and gross loans receivable and negatively affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nLitigation and regulatory actions, including challenges to the arbitration clauses in our customer agreements, could subject us to significant class actions, fines, penalties, judgments and requirements resulting in increased expenses and potential material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. While the arbitration provisions in our customer agreements historically have limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future. There may also be legislative, administrative or regulatory efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate pre-dispute arbitration clauses.\nUnfavorable state legislative or regulatory actions or changes, adverse outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings or failure to comply with existing laws and regulations could force us to cease, suspend or modify our operations in a state, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to federal laws and regulations, we are subject to numerous state laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Many of these regulations impose detailed and complex constraints on the terms of our loans, lending forms and operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil, monetary or other penalties, including the suspension or revocation of our licenses to lend in one or more jurisdictions.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this report, the Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations, and changes in those laws or regulations or their application could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, prospects or ability to continue operations in the jurisdictions affected by these changes. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-State Legislation\u201d and \u201c-Federal Legislation,\u201d and Part I, Item 1A,\u201cRisk Factors,\u201d for more information regarding this legislation and related risks.\nPassage of adverse legislation, such as rate caps on financial lending products or similar initiatives, in any of the states in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, prospects or ability to continue operations in the jurisdictions affected by such changes. We can give no assurance that the laws and regulations that govern our business, or the interpretation or administration of those laws and regulations, will remain unchanged or that any such future changes will not materially and adversely affect or in the worst case, eliminate the Company\u2019s lending practices, operations, profitability or prospects.\nIn addition, any adverse change in existing laws or regulations, or any adverse interpretation or litigation relating to existing laws and regulations in any state in which we operate, could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or could lower or\neliminate the profitability of our operations going forward by, among other things, reducing the amount of interest and fees we can charge in connection with our loans. If these or other factors lead us to close our branches in a state, then in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing, we would also incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use. If we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state, we may also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our branches and our employees in that state, with little or no revenues to offset those costs.\nMedia and public characterization of consumer installment loans as being predatory or abusive could have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nConsumer activist groups and various other media sources continue to advocate for governmental and regulatory action to prohibit or severely restrict our products and services. These critics frequently characterize our products and services as predatory or abusive toward consumers. If this negative characterization of the consumer installment loans we make and/or ancillary services we provide becomes widely accepted by government policy makers or is embodied in legislative, regulatory, policy or litigation developments that adversely affect our ability to continue offering our products and services or the profitability of these products and services, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nEmployee misconduct or misconduct by third parties acting on our behalf could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees or third party contractors could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee or a third party contractor were to engage in, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft, we could suffer direct losses from the activity and, in addition, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships and ability to attract future customers. Employee or third-party misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect violations of such rules. Our branches have experienced employee fraud from time to time, and it is not always possible to deter employee or third-party misconduct. The precautions that we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees or third party contractors, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nInterest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our borrowing costs, profitability and liquidity.\nOur profitability may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates, whether caused by changes in economic conditions or other factors, that affect our borrowing costs. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence the amount of interest we pay on our revolving credit facility or any other floating interest rate obligations we may incur. Our profitability and liquidity could be materially adversely affected during any period of higher interest rates. See Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\u201d for additional information regarding our interest rate risk.\nWe depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to fund our liquidity needs.\nOur revolving credit agreement allows us to borrow up to $480.0 million through June 15, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit agreement, we are required to comply with a number of covenants and conditions, including a minimum borrowing base calculation. If our existing sources of liquidity become insufficient to satisfy our financial needs or our access to these sources becomes unexpectedly restricted, we may need to try to raise additional capital in the future. If such an event were to occur, we can give no assurance that such alternate sources of liquidity would be available to us at all or on favorable terms. Additional information regarding our liquidity risk is included in the risk factor below, \"-We depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to fund our liquidity needs\" and Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur substantial debt could negatively impact our business, prevent us from satisfying our debt obligations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt. As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $244.9 million of total debt outstanding and a total debt to shareholders equity ratio of approximately 0.5 to 1. The substantial amount of our debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, debt refinancing, share repurchases or other purposes could be impaired;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at variable rates, as may any future debt that we incur;\n\u2022\nwe could be more vulnerable to adverse developments in our industry or in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nwe may be restricted from taking advantage of business opportunities or making strategic acquisitions;\n\u2022\nwe may be limited in our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty satisfying our obligations under the debt if accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.\nWe may incur substantially more debt and other liabilities. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our current debt levels.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the terms of our revolving credit agreement contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, as may any future debt that we incur, these restrictions are subject, or likely to be subject, in the case of any future debt, to exceptions that could permit us to incur a substantial amount of additional debt. In addition, our existing and future debt agreements will not prevent us from incurring certain liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness as defined for purposes of those debt agreements. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the risks associated with our having substantial debt could intensify. As of March 31, 2018, we had $234.8 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement, subject to borrowing base limitations and other specified terms and conditions.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding debt and fund operations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will depend in part on our cash flows from operations, which are subject to regulatory, economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may not generate a level of cash flows from operations sufficient to permit us to meet our debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, obtain additional financing or obtain additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. There can be no assurance that any refinancing will be possible or that any asset sales or additional financing can be completed on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe terms of our debt limit how we conduct our business.\nOur revolving credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur and guarantee debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase our stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nmerge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with shareholders and other affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures.\nOur revolving credit agreement also imposes requirements that we maintain specified financial measures not in excess of, or not below, specified levels. In particular, our revolving credit agreement requires, among other things, that we maintain (i) at all times a specified minimum consolidated net worth, (ii) as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a minimum ratio of consolidated net income available for fixed charges for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated fixed charges for that period of not less than a specified minimum, (iii) at all times a specified maximum ratio of total debt to consolidated adjusted\nnet worth and (iv) at all times a specified ratio of subordinated debt to consolidated adjusted net worth. These covenants limit the manner in which we can conduct our business and could prevent us from engaging in favorable business activities or financing future operations and capital needs and impair our ability to successfully execute our strategy and operate our business.\nA breach of any of the covenants in our revolving credit agreement would result in an event of default thereunder. Any event of default would permit the creditors to accelerate the related debt, which could also result in the acceleration of any other or future debt containing a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. In addition, an event of default under our revolving credit agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the revolving credit agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the revolving credit agreement or any other secured debt we may incur, the lenders thereunder could cause the collateral agent to proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our debt, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient assets to repay that debt, and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would suffer. Additional information regarding our revolving credit facility is included in Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and Mexico. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d). The changes included in the TCJA are broad and complex and significantly reform the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a limitation on the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings (except for certain small businesses), a limitation on the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and our expectations regarding our overall tax rate in fiscal 2018 and beyond, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain and the ultimate impact may prove to be inconsistent with our current expectations. As a result, the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by the TCJA, the interpretation and administration of the TCJA, and/or any future tax reform legislation.\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results.\nThe conditions of the U.S. and international capital markets may adversely affect lenders with which we have relationships, causing us to incur additional costs and reducing our sources of liquidity, which may adversely affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nTurbulence in the global capital markets can result in disruptions in the financial sector and affect lenders with which we have relationships, including members of the syndicate of banks that are lenders under our revolving credit agreement. Disruptions in the financial sector may increase our exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of lenders to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements with us. Failure by our lenders to perform under the terms of our lending arrangements could cause us to incur additional costs that may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. While overall market conditions have improved, there can be no assurance that future disruptions in the financial sector will not occur that could have similar adverse effects on our business. Additional information regarding our liquidity and related risks is included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our lending activities.\nOur ability to collect on loans to individuals, our single largest asset group, depends on the ability and willingness of our borrowers to repay such loans. Any material adverse change in the ability or willingness of a significant portion of our borrowers to meet their obligations to us, whether due to changes in economic conditions, unemployment rates, the cost of consumer goods (particularly, but not limited to, food and energy costs), disposable income, interest rates, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or other causes over which we have no control, would have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition. Although new customers are required to submit a listing of personal property that will serve as collateral to secure their loans, the Company does not rely on the value of such collateral in the loan approval process and generally does not perfect its security interest in that collateral. Additional information regarding our credit risk is included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Credit Quality.\u201d\nIf our estimates of loan losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for loan losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nTo estimate the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectibility, including the total amount of loan receivables outstanding, historical loan receivable charge-offs, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our allowance for loan losses is based on the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 450, Contingencies, and, in part, on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic conditions or if we are unable to predict how economic conditions may affect our allowance for loan losses, our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate. Our allowance for loan losses is an estimate, and if actual loan losses are materially greater than our allowance for loan losses, our provision for loan losses would increase, which would result in a decline in our future earnings, and thus our results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for loan losses. Additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses is included in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Credit Quality.\u201d\nIn June of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU significantly changes the way that entities will be required to measure credit losses. The new standard requires that the estimated credit loss be based upon an \u201cexpected credit loss\u201d approach rather than the \u201cincurred loss\u201d approach currently required. The new approach will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectibility. It is anticipated that the expected credit loss model may require earlier recognition of credit losses than the incurred loss approach. This ASU will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this ASU may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information on this new accounting standard.\nThe concentration of our revenues in certain states could adversely affect us.\nWe currently operate consumer installment loan branches in fifteen states in the United States. Any adverse legislative or regulatory change in any one of our states, but particularly in any of our larger states could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and results of operation or financial condition. See Part I, Item 1, \"Description of Business\" for information regarding the size of our business in the various states in which we operate.\nWe have goodwill, which is subject to periodic review and testing for impairment.\nAt March 31, 2018 our total assets contained $7.0 million of goodwill. Under generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill is subject to periodic review and testing to determine if it is impaired. Unfavorable trends in our industry and unfavorable events or disruptions to our operations resulting from adverse legislative or regulatory actions or from other unpredictable causes could result in goodwill impairment charges.\nIf we fail to maintain appropriate controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d) requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act requires us to engage our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify a material weakness in our controls and procedures, our ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC could be adversely affected. In addition, remediation of a material weakness would require our management to devote significant time and incur significant expense. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we are unable to maintain effective controls and procedures we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. Any such consequence or other negative effect could adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock.\nRegular turnover among our managers and other employees at our branches makes it more difficult for us to operate our branches and increases our costs of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe annual turnover as of March 31, 2018 among our branch employees was approximately 35.4%. This turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our branches. If we are unable to keep our employee turnover rates consistent with historical levels or if unanticipated problems arise from our high employee turnover, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to execute our growth strategy may be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy includes opening and acquiring branches in existing and new markets and is subject to significant risks, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state in which we operate or seek to operate, and, to the extent applicable, federal laws and regulations, which are subject to change at any time;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain any regulatory approvals, government permits or licenses that may be required;\n\u2022\nthe degree of competition in new markets and its effect on our ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans; and\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel to staff our new operations.\nWe currently lack product and business diversification; as a result, our revenues and earnings may be disproportionately negatively impacted by external factors and may be more susceptible to fluctuations than more diversified companies.\nOur primary business activity is offering small consumer installment loans together with, in some states in which we operate, related ancillary products. Thus, any developments, whether regulatory, economic or otherwise, that would hinder, reduce the profitability of or limit our ability to operate our small consumer installment loan business on the terms currently conducted would have a direct and adverse impact on our business, profitability and perhaps even our viability. Our current lack of product and business diversification could inhibit our opportunities for growth, reduce our revenues and profits and make us more susceptible to earnings fluctuations than many other financial institutions whose operations are more diversified.\nWe depend on secure information technology, and a breach of those systems or those of third-party vendors could result in significant losses, unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information and reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations and could lead to significant financial and legal exposure.\nOur operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other information about us, our customers and third parties with which we do business. We process a significant number of customer transactions on a continuous basis through our computer systems and networks and are subject to increasingly more risk related to security systems as we enhance our mobile payment technologies and otherwise attempt to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the financial services industry. While we commit resources to the design, implementation, maintenance, and monitoring of our networks and systems, there is no guarantee that our security controls can provide absolute security. Despite the measures we implement to protect our systems and data, we may not be able to anticipate, identify, prevent or detect cyber-attacks, particularly because the techniques used by attackers change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Such third parties may seek to gain unauthorized access to our systems directly, by fraudulently inducing employees, customers, or other users of our systems, or by using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems. Or, they may seek to disrupt or disable our services through attacks such as denial-of-service attacks and ransomware attacks. In addition, we may be unable to identify, or may be significantly delayed in identifying, cyber-attacks and incidents due to the increasing use of techniques and tools that are designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic artifacts. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks, as well as those of third-party vendors we utilize, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, malicious attacks and other events that could have a security impact beyond our control. Our staff, technologies, systems, networks and those of third-parties we utilize also may become the target of cyber-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious code, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, ransomware, and physical attacks that could result in information security breaches, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 operations. We also routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information through third parties, which may be vulnerable to interception, misuse or mishandling.\nIf one or more of such events occur, personal, confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or those of third-party vendors, could be compromised or could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations that could result in significant losses, loss of confidence by and business from customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation, regulatory exposures and harm to our reputation and brand.\nIn the event personal, confidential or other information is threatened, intercepted, misused, mishandled or compromised, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate the circumstances surrounding the event and implement mitigation and remediation measures. We also may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation (including securities fraud class action lawsuits) and regulatory investigation costs and settlements and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. If one or more of such events occur, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.\nAny interruption of our information systems could adversely affect us.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Each branch is part of an information network that is designed to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory, reconcile cash balances on a daily basis and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters. Any failure or interruption of these systems, including any failure of our back-up systems, network outages, slow performance, or similar problems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, loan and other systems, loss of confidential Company, customer or vendor information and could result in a loss of customer confidence and business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity, or expose us to civil litigation, financial liability, and increased costs to remediate such problems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to data privacy laws, which may significantly increase our compliance and technology costs resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various privacy, data protection and information security laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws affecting customer or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation.\nOur centralized headquarters functions are susceptible to disruption by catastrophic events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur headquarters building is located in Greenville, South Carolina. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our branches from this centralized location, and they could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as severe weather, natural disaster, power outage, act of terror or similar event, destroyed or severely damaged our headquarters. Any such catastrophic event or other unexpected disruption of our headquarters functions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAbsence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors.\nSince 1989, we have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and may not pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, our common stock may be less attractive to certain investors than the stock of dividend-paying companies.\nVarious provisions of our charter documents and applicable laws could delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may favor.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, South Carolina law, and the laws in several of the states in which our operating subsidiaries are incorporated could delay or prevent a change of control that the holders of our common stock may favor or may impede the ability of our shareholders to change our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation and South Carolina law, among other things, authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval, and will require the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of our outstanding shares of voting stock, to approve our merger or consolidation with another corporation. Additional information regarding the similar effect of laws in certain states in which we operate is described in Part 1, Item 1, \u201cDescription of Business - Government Regulation.\u201d\nOverall stock market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors could cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to the Company\u2019s operations or the inherent value of its common stock; state or federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are, or are perceived to be, adverse to our operations or the broader consumer finance industry in general; announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in our operating results and the provision for loan losses; low trading volume in our common stock; decreased availability of our common stock resulting from stock repurchases and concentrations of ownership by large or institutional investors; general conditions in the financial service industry, the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; our failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors; negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse developments in our relationships with our customers; investigations or legal proceedings brought against the Company or its officers; or significant changes in our senior management team.\nChanges to accounting rules, regulations or interpretations could significantly affect our financial results.\nNew accounting rules or regulations, changes to existing accounting rules or regulations and changing interpretations of existing rules and regulations have been issued or occurred and may continue to be issued or occur in the future. Our methodology for valuing our receivables and otherwise accounting for our business is subject to change depending upon the changes in, and interpretation of, accounting rules, regulations, or interpretations. Any such changes to accounting rules, regulations or interpretations could negatively affect our reported results of operations and could negatively affect our financial condition through increased cost of compliance.\nA small number of our shareholders have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval and such shareholders have interests which may conflict with the interests of our other security holders.\nAs of May 4, 2018, based on filings made with the SEC and other information made available to us, Prescott General Partners, LLC and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 29.9% of our common stock. As a result, these few shareholders are able to significantly influence matters presented to shareholders, including the election and removal of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as any reclassification, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and the control of our management and affairs, including executive compensation arrangements. Their interests may conflict with the interests of our other security holders.", "PERMNO": 77114, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "WRLD"}
