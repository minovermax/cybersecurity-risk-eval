RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risks may affect us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may suffer. As a result, the price of our common shares could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business.\nLike most banking organizations, a significant portion of our assets consists of loans, which if not repaid could result in losses to the Company.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing the payment of their loans (if any) may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total loan portfolio was approximately $1,958 million or 63% of our total assets. Three major components of the loan portfolio are loans principally secured by real estate, approximately $1,589 million or 81% of total loans; other commercial loans, approximately $323 million or 17% of total loans; and consumer loans, approximately $46 million or 2% of total loans. Our credit risk with respect to our consumer installment loan portfolio and commercial loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses within our local market area. Our credit risk with respect to our residential and commercial real estate mortgage and construction loan portfolio relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses and the value of real estate serving as security for the repayment of the loans. A related risk in connection with loans secured by commercial real estate is the effect of unknown or unexpected environmental contamination, which could make the real estate effectively unmarketable or otherwise significantly reduce its value as security. Continued or worsening declines in the economy could cause additional credit issues, particularly within our residential and commercial real estate mortgage and construction loan portfolio.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level estimated by management to be sufficient to cover probable incurred loan losses in our loan portfolio. Loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date. In determining the size of the allowance, our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification by industry of our commercial loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the local real estate markets on collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period, the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security, and the evaluation of our loan portfolio by an external loan review. If our assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Additionally, continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside the Company's control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Federal and state regulators also periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIf we foreclose on collateral property, we may be subject to the increased costs associated with ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues and earnings.\nWe may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) environmental remediation liabilities; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and (x) acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property, and we may have to advance funds in order to protect our investment, or we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nSignificant interest rate volatility could reduce our profitability.\nThe interest rate risk inherent in our lending, investing, and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business. We derive our income mainly from the difference or \"spread\" between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. In general, the wider the spread, the more net interest income we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can greatly affect our income. In addition, interest rate fluctuations can affect how much money we may be able to lend. Changes in interest rates may also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on our loans and the level of financing or refinancing by customers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates.\nNew mortgage regulations may adversely impact our business.\nRevisions made pursuant to Dodd-Frank to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), effective in January 2014, apply to all consumer mortgages (except home equity lines of credit, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages, or temporary loans), and mandate specific underwriting criteria and \"ability to repay\" requirements for home loans. This may impact our offering and underwriting of single family residential loans in our residential mortgage lending operation and could have a resulting unknown effect on potential delinquencies. In addition, the relatively uniform requirements may make it difficult for regional and community banks to compete against the larger national banks for single family residential loan originations.\nWe may be required to pay significantly higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) premiums in the future.\nInsured institution failures during the past several years have significantly increased FDIC loss provisions, resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio to historical lows. In addition the Dodd-Frank Act permanently implemented FDIC insurance coverage for all deposit accounts up to $250,000 and revised the insurance premium assessment base from all domestic deposits to the average of total assets less tangible equity. The minimum reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund has been increased from 1.15% to 1.35%, with the increase to be covered by assessments on insured institutions with assets over $10 billion until the new reserve ratio is reached.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Additionally, the FDIC may make material changes to the calculation of the prepaid assessment from the current proposal. Any future changes in the calculation or assessment of FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all.\nFuture growth or operating results may require the Company to raise additional capital but that capital may not be available or it may be dilutive.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. To the extent our future operating results erode capital or we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisition we may be required to raise capital. Our ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital if needed or on favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand our operations through acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches and may result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our management team. The loss of any of our senior managers could have an adverse effect on our growth and performance because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate and years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. The loss of key personnel in a particular market could have an adverse effect on our performance in that market because it may be difficult to find qualified replacement personnel who are already located in or would be willing to relocate to a non-metropolitan market. Additionally, recent regulations issued by banking regulators regarding executive compensation may impact our ability to compensate executives and, as a result, to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThe geographic concentration of our markets makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions.\nUnlike larger banking organizations that are more geographically diversified, our operations are currently concentrated in 31 counties in Indiana, three counties in Illinois, three counties in Ohio, and five counties in Kentucky. As a result of this geographic\nconcentration in four fairly contiguous markets, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. A deterioration in economic conditions in one or all of these markets could result in one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 an increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u00b7 an increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u00b7 a decrease in the demand for our products and services; or\n\u00b7 a decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers' borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage.\nIf we do not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, our financial performance may suffer.\nWe face substantial competition for deposit, credit and trust relationships, as well as other sources of funding in the communities we serve. Competing providers include other banks, thrifts and trust companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking operations, credit unions, finance companies, money market funds and other financial and nonfinancial companies which may offer products functionally equivalent to those offered by the Bank. Competing providers may have greater financial resources than we do and offer services within and outside the market areas we serve. In addition to this challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, our competitors now include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services to their customers that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. If we are unable to adjust both to increased competition for traditional banking services and changing customer needs and preferences, it could adversely affect our financial performance and your investment in our common stock.\nAcquisitions entail risks which could negatively affect our operations.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7 exposure to asset quality problems of the acquired institution;\n\u00b7 maintaining adequate regulatory capital;\n\u00b7 diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7 risks and expenses of entering new geographic markets;\n\u00b7 potential significant loss of depositors or loan customers from the acquired institution; or\n\u00b7 exposure to undisclosed or unknown liabilities of an acquired institution.\nAny of these acquisition risks could result in unexpected losses or expenses and thereby reduce the expected benefits of the acquisition.\nUnanticipated costs related to our acquisitions could reduce our future earnings per share.\nWe believe we have reasonably estimated the likely costs of integrating the operations of the banks we acquire into the Company and the incremental costs of operating such banks as a part of the MainSource family. However, it is possible that unexpected transaction costs such as taxes, fees or professional expenses or unexpected future operating expenses, such as increased personnel costs or increased taxes, as well as other types of unanticipated adverse developments, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of MainSource. If unexpected costs are incurred, acquisitions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share. Current accounting guidance requires expensing of acquisition costs. In prior years, these costs could be capitalized. In other words, if we incur such unexpected costs and expenses as a result of our acquisitions, we believe that the earnings per share of our common stock could be less than they would have been if those acquisitions had not been completed.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of the banks we have acquired and may acquire in the future and retain employees of such banks.\nOur acquisition strategy involves the integration of the banks we have acquired and may acquire in the future as MainSource subsidiary banks. The difficulties of integrating the operations of such banks with MainSource and its other subsidiary banks include:\n\u00b7 coordinating geographically separated organizations;\n\u00b7 integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds;\n\u00b7 combining different corporate cultures; or\n\u00b7 retaining key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the Company, our subsidiary banks and the banks we have acquired and may acquire in the future and the loss of key personnel. The integration of such banks as MainSource subsidiary banks requires the experience and expertise of certain key employees of such banks who we expect to retain. We cannot be sure, however, that we will be successful in retaining these employees for the time period necessary to successfully integrate such banks' operations as subsidiary banks of MainSource. The diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the mergers, along with the integration of the banks as MainSource subsidiary banks, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nRisks Relating to the Banking Industry\nChanges in governmental regulation and legislation could limit our future performance and growth.\nWe are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that governs almost all aspects of our operations, as well as any acquisitions we may propose to make. Any change in applicable federal or state laws or regulations could have a substantial impact on us, our subsidiary banks and our operations. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could reduce the value of your investment.\nThe implementation of final rules under the many provisions of Dodd-Frank Act could adversely affect us.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes from the enactment and ongoing implementation of Dodd-Frank. Certain provisions of Dodd-Frank are effective and have been fully implemented, including the revisions in the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and the permanent increase in FDIC coverage to $250,000; the permissibility of paying interest on business checking accounts; the removal of remaining barriers to interstate branching and required disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Other recent actions to implement the final Dodd-Frank provisions include (i) final new capital rules, (ii) a final rule to implement the \"Volcker Rule\" restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities and (iii) the promulgation of final rules and increased enforcement action by the CFPB. The full implementation of certain final rules is delayed or phased in over several years; therefore, as yet we cannot definitively assess what may be the short or longer term specific or aggregate effect of the full implementation of Dodd-Frank on us.\nChanges in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which we may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, investigations and limitations related to our securities, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. In light of the recent conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy, Congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDifficult conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally have affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom 2007 through 2009, the U.S. economy was in recession. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. was greatly reduced. Although economic conditions have improved, certain sectors, such as real estate, remain weak and unemployment remains high. Local governments and many businesses are still in serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. The Company's financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services that the Company offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the\ncost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters, or a combination of these or other factors.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, the business environment continued to be adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and worldwide. While economic conditions in the United States and worldwide have begun to improve, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Such conditions have affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the credit quality of the Company's loans, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect our financial results.\nTechnology and other changes now allow many customers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers.\nOur earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failure.\nFinancial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk. A fraud can be perpetrated by a customer of MainSource, an employee, a vendor, or members of the general public. We are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, ATM transactions and checking transactions. Our largest fraud risk, associated with the origination of loans, includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties. Compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our standards. There can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by the third parties that we deal with. Repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact the performance of our loan portfolio.\nRisks Related to the Company's Stock\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nThe Company has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common stockholders. The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and receives substantially all of its revenue and cash flow from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. Indiana state law and agreements between the Bank and its federal and state regulators may limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company. In the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company for an extended period of time, the Company may not be able to service its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock. Additionally, any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on the Bank's earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Company's Board of Directors. Starting in the second quarter of 2009 and continuing to the second quarter of 2012, the Company reduced the amount of cash dividends paid. This reduction was made to preserve capital levels at the Company. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the Company has steadily raised the dividend, including an increase to $.12/share in the third quarter of 2014 and $.13/share in the first quarter of 2015.\nThe price of the Company's common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\nGeneral market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the Company's common stock. In addition, the following factors may cause the market price for shares of the Company's common stock to fluctuate:\n\u00b7 announcements of developments related to the Company's business;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the Company's results of operations;\n\u00b7 sales or purchases of substantial amounts of the Company's securities in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 general conditions in the Company's banking niche or the worldwide economy;\n\u00b7 a shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts' expectations;\n\u00b7 changes in analysts' recommendations or projections; and\n\u00b7 the Company's announcement of new acquisitions or other projects.\nThe Company's charter documents and federal regulations may inhibit a takeover, or prevent a transaction that may favor or otherwise limit the Company's growth opportunities, which could cause the market price of the Company's common stock to decline.\nCertain provisions of the Company's charter documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. In addition, the Company must obtain approval from regulatory authorities before acquiring control of any other company.", "PERMNO": 77256, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MSFG"}
