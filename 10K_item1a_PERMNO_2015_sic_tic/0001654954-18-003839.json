{"cik": "1697851", "company": "Novume Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure and Business\nWe are currently not profitable and we may be unable to become profitable on a quarterly or annual basis.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we had a loss from operations before taxes of $5,335,799. We cannot assure that we will be profitable in the future. Our ability to become profitable in future periods could be impacted by budgetary constraints, government and political agendas, economic instability and other items that are not in our control. We cannot assure that our financial performance will sustain a sufficient level to completely support operations. A significant portion of our expenses are fixed in advance. As such, we generally are unable to reduce our expenses significantly in the short-term to compensate for any unexpected delay or decrease in anticipated revenues or increases in planned investments. As a result, we may continue to experience operating losses and net losses in the future, which would make it difficult to fund operations and achieve our business plan and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf we experience declining or flat revenues and fail to manage such declines effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plans and may experience future weaknesses in operating results.\nTo achieve future growth, we will need to continue to add additional qualified personnel, and invest in additional research and development and sales and marketing activities, which could lead to increases in our expenses and future declines in operating results. In addition, our future expansion is expected to place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage these activities or any revenue declines successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business has significant working capital needs and if we are unable to satisfy those needs from cash generated from our operations or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, our financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business. If we experience a significant and sustained drop in operating profits, or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays, we may be subject to cash shortfalls. If such a shortfall were to occur for even a brief period, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use working capital to pay expenses relating to our employees and temporary workers and to satisfy our workers\u2019 compensation liabilities. Generally, we pay our workers on a biweekly basis while we generally receive payments from our customers 30 to 60 days after billing. As a result, we must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay employees and independent contractors and fund related payroll liabilities prior to receiving payment from customers.\nWe have derived working capital for our operations through cash generated by our operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our current sources of capital are adequate to meet our working capital needs. However, our available sources of capital are limited. If our working capital needs increase in the future, we may be forced to seek additional sources of capital, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe amount we are entitled to borrow under our revolving credit facility is calculated monthly based on the aggregate value of certain eligible trade accounts receivable generated from our operations, which are affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows. The aggregate value of our eligible accounts receivable may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities, which could reduce our ability to react to changes in the market or industry conditions.\nOur revolving credit facility includes various financial and other covenants with which the Company must comply in order to maintain borrowing availability and avoid penalties, including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum working capital ratio.\nAny future failure to comply with the covenants which may occur under our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could trigger prepayment obligations. There can be no assurance that any future lender will waive defaults that may occur in the future. If we were forced to refinance our revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that such refinancing would be available or that such refinancing would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Even if such refinancing were available, the terms could be less favorable, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and interest rates.\nThe success of our business will depend, in part, on the continued services of certain key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThe success of our business will depend, in part, on the continued services of certain members of our management. In particular, the loss of the services of any of Robert A. Berman as Chief Executive Officer and our director, Harry Rhulen as President, and Suzanne Loughlin as Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could significantly disrupt our business.\nIn addition, as a solutions provider that provides engineers, certified technicians and other professionals, our business is labor intensive and, therefore, our ability to attract, retain, and expand our senior management, sales personnel, and professional and technical staff is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for qualified engineers, certified technicians, and other professionals is competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain such professionals. It may also be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals in the timeframe demanded by our clients. Furthermore, some of our contracts may require us to employ only individuals who have particular government security clearance levels. Our failure to attract and retain key individuals could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and conduct our business effectively.\nOur strategy of growth through acquisitions could excessively burden or otherwise strain our business.\nIt is our intent to continue to grow through strategic acquisitions. Investigation of target businesses, and negotiations and financial arrangements to acquire them, require significant management efforts and involve substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. Successful integration of newly acquired target companies may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources, and may require the implementation of additional internal controls and management and financial systems. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration processes could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may be unable to execute our acquisition strategy as planned, resulting in under-utilized resources and a failure to achieve anticipated growth. Our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected if we are unable to achieve, or achieve on a timely basis, cost savings or revenue opportunities from any future acquisitions, or incur unforeseen costs and expenses or experience unexpected operating difficulties from the integration of acquired businesses.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions which we consummate.\nWe acquired Firestorm, Brekford, Global and BC Management in 2017, and Secure Education Consultants, LLC (\u201cSEC LLC\u201d) in January 2018. We have only just begun to integrate the operations of these acquired companies that previously operated independently. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter significant difficulties in integrating the respective operations of these companies.\nThe difficulties of integrating the acquisitions may include, among others:\n\u25cf\nunanticipated issues in integration of information, communications, and other systems;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated incompatibility of logistics, marketing, and administration methods;\n\u25cf\nintegrating the business cultures of both companies;\n\u25cf\npreserving important strategic client relationships;\n\u25cf\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; and\n\u25cf\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations.\nThe achievement of the benefits expected from integration of the acquired companies may require us to incur significant costs. The incurrence of any such costs, as well as any unexpected costs or delays, in connection with such integration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties following the consummation of acquisitions that could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainties about the effect of our recent acquisitions on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on our company. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel for a period of time after the acquisitions, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us, which may have an adverse effect on the Company. Employee retention may be particularly challenging, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company. If, despite our retention efforts, key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us, as the case may be, our business could be seriously harmed.\nResources could be wasted in pursuing acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a potential business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete a potential business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. These may include terms and conditions which we are unable to satisfy or actions on the part of an acquisition target that prevents us from completing the acquisition on reasonable terms. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred, including fees and penalties for non-performance, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. We may also experience litigation intended to challenge or otherwise prevent the consummation of an acquisition or as a result of non-consummation of a planned merger. Such litigation may consume management resources, distract our personnel and result in publicity which affects our future acquisitions.\nWe may be required to write-down certain assets after completing our required annual evaluations, which may affect our reported financial results.\nThe initial determination of the fair value of assets we acquire upon consummation of an acquisition is based upon a valuation. We are required to analyze the carrying value of our acquired intangibles and goodwill on an annual basis going forward. After we complete the detailed annual evaluation of the carrying value of the intangible assets, we may be required to make adjustments to our consolidated balance sheet and/or statement of operations. Any adjustments will affect our reported financial results.\nWe may issue additional notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial additional debt which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in the Company.\nThe anticipated cash needs of our business could change significantly as we pursue and complete business acquisitions, if our business plans change, if economic conditions change from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated, or if other unexpected circumstances arise that may have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our business. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1,405,994 of notes payable and $3,663,586 due on lines of credit. On April 3, 2018, Novume and Brekford entered into a transaction pursuant to which an institutional investor loaned to $2,000,000 to Novume and Brekford. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business, either internally or through acquisition, we may need to seek to secure additional debt financing. We may not be able to obtain financing arrangements on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to meet our needs in the future.\nThe incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u25cf\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;\n\u25cf\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;\n\u25cf\nincreased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u25cf\nlimitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nImproper disclosure of confidential and personal data could result in liability and harm to our reputation.\nWe store and processes increasingly large amounts of confidential information concerning our employees, customers and vendors, as well as confidential information on behalf of our customers and must ensure that such storage and processing is compliant with our contractual obligations and all applicable national and local privacy laws, rules, and regulations. These laws, rules, and regulations can vary significantly from country to country, with many being more onerous than those in the U.S. The risk of failing to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations increases as we continue to expand globally and become subject to an increasing number of foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Moreover, we must ensure that all of our vendors who have access to such information also have the appropriate privacy policies, procedures and protections in place. Although we take appropriate measures to protect such information, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee or subcontractor error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are growing increasingly sophisticated. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nThis environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls throughout the Company. Despite these efforts, it is possible that our security controls over data, training, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable or other confidential information.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could be liable under laws and regulations that protect personal or other confidential data resulting in increases costs or loss of revenues and the market perception of our services could be harmed.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.\nWe face various cyber and other security threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks; insider threats; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts or other acts of aggression. Cyber threats are constant and evolving and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, malicious software, destructive malware, attacks by computer hackers attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, disruption or denial of service attacks, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release or loss of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or subcontractors), and corruption of data, networks or systems. In addition, we could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in our partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 systems that are used in connection with our business. Our clients and subcontractors face similar threats and/or they may not be able to detect or deter them, or effectively to mitigate resulting losses. These threats could damage our reputation as well as our subcontractor\u2019s ability to perform and could affect our client\u2019s ability to pay.\nAlthough we use various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats to us, our clients and our partners, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could result in the loss of information or capabilities, harm to individuals or property, damage to our reputation and/or require remedial actions or lead to loss of business, regulatory actions potential liability and financial loss, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe are dependent upon technology services, and if we experience damage, service interruptions or failures in our computer and telecommunications systems, our customer and worker relationships and our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected.\nOur business could be interrupted by damage to or disruption of our computer, telecommunications equipment, or software systems. Our customers\u2019 businesses may be adversely affected by any system or equipment failure we experience. As a result of any of the foregoing, our relationships with our customers may be impaired, we may lose customers, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to contractual liability. Precautions in place to protect us from, or minimize the effect of, such events may not be adequate.\nIn addition, the failure or disruption of mail, communications and/or utilities could cause an interruption or suspension of our operations or otherwise harm our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, revenue, profits and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards, we will not be able to remain competitive, and the demand for our services will likely decline.\nThe markets in which we operate are in general characterized by the following factors:\n\u25cf\nchanges due to rapid technological advances;\n\u25cf\nadditional qualification requirements related to technological challenges; and\n\u25cf\nevolving industry standards and changes in the regulatory and legislative environment.\nOur future success will depend upon our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards, and to effectively develop, introduce, market and gain broad acceptance of new product and service enhancements incorporating the latest technological advancements.\nImprovements in communications technology could expand the pool of potential competitors and diminish the demand for our traditional services.\nBased on recent technological developments, the market for outsourced services may diminish. Some of our competitors are beginning to advertise for various services on line, including experts for sale, anonymous authors to complete certain proposal sections for an \u201cintroductory fee,\u201d and even selling entire proposals on-line, sometimes by overseas vendors at extremely low prices. If these companies are successful at providing traditional consulting services at prices we cannot compete with, it may diminish the demand for some of our services, which may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry with low barriers to entry, and may be unable to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.\nOur business is highly competitive, and we compete with companies that may have greater name recognition and financial resources, as well as many independent sole proprietors who sell themselves as outsourced resources. We also compete with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants and other providers of services. We expect that the level of competition will remain high, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.\nThe needs of our clients change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to develop services and solutions that address these changing needs of our clients, and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and solutions. In order to compete effectively in our markets, we must target our potential customers carefully, continue to improve our efficiencies and the scope and quality of our services, and rely on our service quality, innovation, and client relations to provide services on a cost-effective basis to our clients. Our competitors may be able to provide clients with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide, including technical qualifications, past contract experience, geographic presence, price and the availability of qualified professional personnel.\nIn addition, heightened competition among our existing competitors, especially on a price basis, or by new entrants into the market, could create additional competitive pressures that may reduce our margins and adversely affect our business. If our competitive advantages are not compelling or sustainable, then we are unlikely to increase or sustain profits and our stock price could decline.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with geographic market concentration.\nThe geographic concentration of revenue greater than 10% of our pro forma consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was generated in the following areas:\nConsequently, economic conditions in these regions could reduce demand for our products and services, increase costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of future operations.\nA downturn of the U.S. or global economy could result in our customers using fewer workforce solutions and services or becoming unable to pay us for our services on a timely basis or at all, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nBecause demand for our solutions and services are sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity, our business may suffer during economic downturns. During periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for outsourced services could decline. When demand drops, our operating profit could be impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base because expenses may not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, we can only reduce selling and administrative expenses to a certain level without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our business.\nAdditionally, during economic downturns companies may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. If our customers become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer significantly.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and losses, including class action lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe typically place or assign personnel in the workplaces of other businesses. The risks of these activities include possible claims relating to:\n\u25cf\ndiscrimination and harassment;\n\u25cf\nwrongful termination or denial of employment;\n\u25cf\nviolations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;\n\u25cf\nclassification of temporary workers;\n\u25cf\nassignment of illegal aliens;\n\u25cf\nviolations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u25cf\nretroactive entitlement to temporary worker benefits;\n\u25cf\nerrors and omissions by our independent contractors or temporary workers;\n\u25cf\nmisuse of customer proprietary information;\n\u25cf\nmisappropriation of funds;\n\u25cf\ndamage to customer facilities due to negligence; and\n\u25cf\ncriminal activity.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these claims. In addition, these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. New employment and labor laws and regulations may be proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. There can also be no assurance that the insurance policies we have purchased to insure against certain risks will be adequate or that insurance coverage will remain available on commercially reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage.\nWe are dependent on workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage at commercially reasonable terms.\nWe provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance for our employees and temporary workers and are contractually obligated to collateralize our workers\u2019 compensation obligations under our workers\u2019 compensation program through irrevocable letters of credit, surety bonds or cash. A significant portion of our workers\u2019 compensation program renews annually on January 1 of each year, and as part of the renewal, could be subject to an increase in collateral. In addition, collateral requirements can be significant and place pressure on our liquidity and working capital capacity. Further, we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Depending on future changes in collateral requirements, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital in the future, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of our workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage would prevent us from doing business in the majority of our markets\nThe spending cuts imposed by Congress could impact our operating results.\nThe U.S. government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending, tax, and other initiatives to stimulate the economy, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. One of these initiatives, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the \u201cBCA\u201d), imposed constraints around U.S. government spending. In an attempt to balance decisions regarding defense, homeland security, and other federal spending priorities, the BCA imposed spending caps that contain approximately $487 billion in reductions to the Department of Defense base budgets over a seven-year period (to 2021). Additionally, the BCA triggered an automatic sequestration process, effective March 1, 2013, that would have reduced planned defense spending by an additional $500 billion over a nine-year period that began in the U.S. government\u2019s 2013 fiscal year. In 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (\u201cBBA 2015\u201d) raised the limit on the U.S. government\u2019s debt until March 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the BCA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (\u201cBBA 2013\u201d) suspended some budget cuts that would have otherwise been instituted through sequestration in the U.S. government\u2019s 2014 and 2015 fiscal years. While BBA 2013 and BBA 2015 (collectively, the \u201cBipartisan Budget Acts\u201d), taken together, increased discretionary spending limits through the U.S. government\u2019s 2017 fiscal year, the Bipartisan Budget Acts retained sequestration cuts for the U.S. government\u2019s 2018 through 2021 fiscal years.\nIn March 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (the \u201c2018 Act\u201d) was signed into law. It provides $1.3 trillion in funding through September 2018 and represents the largest investment in national defense in 15 years. It also anticipates $500 billion in new federal spending for defense and domestic programs over two years. Although the 2018 Act included a 2.4% pay raise for military personnel it also provides for significant increases military procurements. Furthermore, the 2018 Act seeks to maximize the participation of small and socio-economically diverse companies, which may increase the number of contractors offering goods and services to the federal government.\nThere remains uncertainty regarding how, or if, sequestration cuts will be applied in the U.S. government\u2019s 2019 fiscal year and beyond. Despite the increases provided for in the Bipartisan Budget Act and the 2018 Act, in light of the budget restrictions under the BCA that will be in effect through 2021 and other deficit reduction pressures which may arise in the future, the degree of congressional constraint on discretionary spending by the U.S. government will remain a question for a number of years.\nIf annual appropriations bills are not enacted on a timely basis for the future fiscal years, the U.S. government may once again operate under continuing resolution(s), thus abating RFP processes and restricting new contracts or program starts and resulting in government slowdowns, or even shutdowns. The uncertainty regarding the volume of RFPs issued by the U.S. government could have long-term impacts for our industry and our Company, including that we may not have sufficient resources to handle any increase in demand for services.\nSince we generate significant revenues from clients that bid on contracts with U.S. government agencies, our operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the U.S. government, as well as by delays in RFP processes, program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts.\nA delay in the completion of the budget process of the U.S. government could delay procurement of our services and have an adverse effect on our future revenue.\nWhen the U.S. government does not complete its budget process before its fiscal year-end on September 30 in any year, government operations are typically funded by means of a continuing resolution. Under a continuing resolution, the government essentially authorizes agencies of the U.S. government to continue to operate and fund programs at the prior year end but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, government agencies may delay the procurement of services, which could reduce our future revenue.\nIf our contractors and subcontractors fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our revenue, profitability, and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on contractors and subcontractors in conducting our business. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our contractors or subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor, client concerns about the contractor or subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract or subcontract. In addition, if any of our subcontractors fail to perform the agreed-upon services, go out of business, or fail to perform on a project, then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized and we may be contractually responsible for the work performed by those contractors or subcontractors. Historically, our relationship with our contractors and subcontractors have been good, and we have not experienced any material failure of performance by our contractors and subcontractors. However, there can be no assurance that such experience will continue and the absence of qualified subcontractors with which we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts.\nWe also rely on relationships with other contractors when we act as their subcontractor or joint venture partner. Our future revenue and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their subcontracts or teaming arrangement relationships with us or if a government agency terminates or reduces these other contractors\u2019 programs, does not award them new contracts, or refuses to pay under a contract.\nDue to the competitive process to obtain contracts and an increase in bid protests, we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability.\nWe expect that some of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be under service agreements awarded to our clients through a competitive bidding process, including Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (\u201cID/IQ\u201d) contracts. The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. As a result, there is a tendency for it to place emphasis on low price over technical merit when selecting contractors. This in turn can result in the U.S. government contracts market attracting extremely low-priced competitors who expect consulting products and services to be priced accordingly. Government contractors may decide that they can prepare their bid responses with internal resources and not engage outside organizations to assist this process.\nThe competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to our clients, and therefore puts our reputation at risk and may affect our future contracts with these clients, or that may be awarded but for which we customers do not receive meaningful task orders which might make them less likely to bid for additional task orders. For support contracts awarded to us, we also face the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill these engagements, which also could impact our reputation and the likelihood of getting additional engagements for capture and proposal support.\nOur business is directly tied to the success of our government contracting clients, which are increasingly reliant on ID/IQ contracts. ID/IQ contracts are not firm orders for services, and we may generate limited or no revenue from these contracts which could adversely affect our operating performance.\nID/IQ contracts are typically awarded to multiple contractors, and the award of an ID/IQ contract does not represent a firm order for services. Generally, under an ID/IQ contract, the government is not obligated to order a minimum of services or supplies from its contractor, irrespective of the total estimated contract value. In effect, an ID/IQ award acts as a \u201clicense,\u201d permitting a government contractor to bid on task orders issued under the ID/IQ contract, but not guaranteeing the award of individual task orders. Following an award under a multi-award ID/IQ program, the customer develops requirements for task orders that are competitively bid against all of the contract awardees. However, many contracts also permit the U.S. government to direct work to a specific contractor. Our clients may not win new task orders under these contracts for various reasons, including price, past performance and responsiveness, among others. We support our government contractor clients both when they compete to get the umbrella ID/IQ contract and subsequently when we help the winners of those contracts compete for individual tasks. The proposals for both stages can be relatively brief and require quick turn-arounds, thus potentially reducing some opportunities to be awarded significant turn-key engagements. While it is possible that the increased importance of winning the umbrella ID/IQ contract will prompt clients to hire outside firms to prepare their proposals, it is also likely that government contractors will decide to prepare ID/IQ proposals without the assistance from outside experts.\nWe incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to related compliance matters.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. under rules implemented by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), and The NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d). These impose various requirements on public companies, including establishing and maintaining effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management team will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements and we may need to hire additional personnel. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. To achieve compliance with Section 404, we engage in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants, and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and divert management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nAs a public company, complying with applicable rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain and maintain the same or similar coverage.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our management concluded that the Company had material weaknesses in its internal controls because we did not have adequately designed internal controls to ensure the timely preparation and review of the accounting for certain complex, non-routine transactions by those with appropriate technical expertise, which was necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures would be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In addition, we did not have adequately designed and documented financial close and management review controls to properly detect and prevent certain accounting errors and omitted disclosures in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. As defined in the Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management is developing a plan to remediate the material weaknesses although there can be no assurance that such plans, when enacted, will be successful.\nManagement continues to review and assess our internal controls to ensure we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls. However, any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, and cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required with respect to annual reports that we will file. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations, which could subject our business to higher tax liability.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carry-forwards that we can offset future taxable income with for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $5.91 million and $0.27 million, respectively. A lack of future taxable income could adversely affect our ability to use these NOLs. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, including through acquisitions, could result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and may result in a limitation on the amount of NOL carry-forwards that could be used annually to offset future taxable income and taxes payable. Our NOLs at December 31, 2017 may also be impaired under similar provisions of state law, and may expire unused or underused, which would prevent us from using our NOL carry-forwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have experienced volatility in earnings and cash flows from operations from year to year. If our business declines, we may need to raise additional capital to pursue acquisitions or expand our operations. Such additional capital may be raised through bank borrowings, or other debt or equity financings. We cannot assure you that any additional capital will be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, and such additional financing may result in further dilution to our stockholders.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\npotential acquisitions of businesses and product lines;\n\u25cf\nour ability to control costs;\n\u25cf\nour ability to increase revenue, reduce net losses or generate net income;\n\u25cf\nincreased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses;\n\u25cf\nour need to respond to technological advancements and our competitors\u2019 introductions of new products, services or technologies;\n\u25cf\ncapital improvements to new and existing facilities and enhancements to subsidiaries\u2019 infrastructure and systems;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our services, and the overall level of sales of our services;\n\u25cf\nour relationships with customers and suppliers and the promptness of their payments;\n\u25cf\ngovernment budgets, political agendas and other funding issues, including potential delays in government contract awards;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully negotiate arrangements with credit providers and the state of the financial markets, in general; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions, including the level of economic activity and the effects of international conflicts.\nIf our capital requirements are materially different from those currently planned, we may need additional capital sooner than anticipated. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to continue our operations as planned, develop or enhance our products, expand our sales and marketing programs, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, or we may be forced to sell assets at prices below their stated value.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThere has been a limited public market for our common stock, the stock price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the public offering price.\nOur common stock was previously quoted on the OTCQX and has been trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market since January 10, 2018. There is no established trading market for some of our securities and there has been a limited public market for our common stock. The market prices of the securities of newly listed companies can be highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our results of operations, cash flows, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u25cf\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to raise additional capital\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nvariations in general market, financial markets, economic, and political conditions in the United States;\n\u25cf\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations or new business models;\n\u25cf\nacquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nnew laws, regulations, or executive orders, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us, or unfavorable determinations or settlements in any such suits;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our technology, or third-party proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events;\n\u25cf\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements;\n\u25cf\nsales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf\ndelays in government contracts and funding from time to time and budgetary constraints at the federal, state and local levels;\n\u25cf\nthe long lead times associated with government contracts;\n\u25cf\nour ability to control costs;\n\u25cf\nour ability to develop, introduce, patent, market and gain market acceptance of new products, applications and product enhancements in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of the products incorporating our technologies and products;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of new products by competitors;\n\u25cf\nthe availability and cost of components used in the manufacture of our products;\n\u25cf\nour success in expanding and implementing our sales and marketing programs;\n\u25cf\nthe effects of technological changes in our target markets;\n\u25cf\nthe nature of our government contracts;\n\u25cf\ndecrease in revenues derived from key or significant customers;\n\u25cf\nrisks and uncertainties associated with our international business;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and political conditions;\n\u25cf\nother factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, natural disasters.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease covering us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of as of March 31, 2018, we have outstanding a total of 14,496,697 shares of common stock and 1,322,913 warrants. Based on shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018, 14,518,690 shares of common stock, or 66.6%, are held by our officers, directors and their affiliated entities, and will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and various vesting agreements. In addition, 2,585,021 shares of our common stock that are subject to outstanding options and warrants as of March 31, 2018, as well as 811,514 shares issuable upon the conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, and 481,722 shares issuable upon the conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock, will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements, and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued on exercise of outstanding options, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe also expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to quarterly dividends as set forth in more detail in the section entitled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d We currently anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain all of our future earnings for the development, operation and growth of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any future determination to pay dividends on our common stock in will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nOur executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their affiliates will continue to exercise significant influence over our company after this offering, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of March 31, 2018, our executive officers, directors, five percent or greater stockholders and their respective affiliates owned in the aggregate approximately 79.0% of our common stock.\nThese stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position and may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company,\" meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a \"smaller reporting company,\" have a public float of less than $75 million and have annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. As a \"smaller reporting company,\" we are subject to lesser disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers. Specifically, \"smaller reporting companies\" are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings, are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited consolidated financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status a \"smaller reporting company\" may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including:\n\u25cf\nthe vote of 66 2/3 of the voting power of the corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors is required for the removal of a member of our Board;\n\u25cf\nthe vote of 66 2/3 of the voting power of the corporation entitled to vote at an election of directors is required before any of our Bylaws may, at any annual meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose, be altered, amended, rescinded or repealed; and\n\u25cf\nthe request of one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 35% of the vote at a meeting is required to call a stockholder meeting.\nThese provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take certain actions you desire.", "PERMNO": 17270, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "REKR"}
