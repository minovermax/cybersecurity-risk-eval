Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this Form 10-K or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, efforts to mitigate the pandemic, and the related weakening economic conditions, have impacted our business and could have a significant negative impact on our operations, liquidity, financial condition and financial results\nIn early 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, started to impact the global economic environment causing extreme volatility and uncertainty in global markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and we started to see certain impacts to our business. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related adverse public health developments, and government orders to \"stay in place,\" have adversely affected work forces, economies and financial markets globally. Quarantines and \"stay in place\" orders, the timing and length of containment and eradication solutions, travel restrictions, absenteeism by infected workers, labor shortages or other disruptions to our supply chain or to our customers, have adversely impacted our sales and operating results and have resulted in some continued project delays. In addition, the pandemic contributed to an economic downturn that could affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for projects, which could therefore impact demand for our products and services. Order lead times could be extended or delayed and our pricing or pricing by our suppliers for needed materials could increase. Some critical materials, products or services may become unavailable if the regional or global spread were significant enough to prevent alternative sourcing.\nTo date, we have experienced delays in commercial construction projects due to COVID-19. While the construction and construction-related industries are considered an \"essential service\" in most jurisdictions in which we operate, site closures or project delays have occurred and increased social distancing and health-related precautions are required on many work sites, which may cause additional project delays and additional costs to be incurred. Within the LSO segment, we also experienced the temporary closure of many of our customer's retail locations. We also were required temporarily to shut down our factories in this segment to comply with government \"stay in place\" orders.\nWe expect this global pandemic to continue to have an impact on our future revenue and results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate severity and spread of the disease, the intensity and duration of outbreaks, travel restrictions and social distancing requirements in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain, treat and eradicate the disease.\nGiven the speed and frequency of continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impact to our future results of operations, liquidity or financial position. To the extent that our customers and suppliers are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, this could reduce the availability, or result in delays, of materials or supplies, or delays in customer payments, which in turn could materially interrupt our business operations and/or impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nMarket and Industry Risks\nNorth American and global economic and industry-related business conditions materially affect our sales and results of operations\nOur Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass and Architectural Services segments are significantly influenced by North American economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry. The commercial construction industry is impacted by macroeconomic trends, such as availability of credit, employment levels, consumer confidence, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, changes in architectural design trends, demographic trends, and/or remote work trends could negatively impact demand for our products. To the extent changes in these factors negatively impact the overall commercial construction industry, our revenue and profits could be significantly reduced.\nOur LSO segment primarily depends on the strength of the retail custom picture framing industry. This industry is dependent on consumer confidence and the conditions of the U.S. economy. A decline in consumer confidence, whether as a result of an economic slowdown (due to COVID-19 concerns discussed above or otherwise), uncertainty regarding the future or other factors, could result in a decrease in net sales and operating income of this segment.\nGlobal instability and uncertainty arising from events outside of our control, such as significant natural disasters, political crises, public health crises and pandemics, and/or other catastrophic events could materially affect our results of operations\nNatural disasters, political crises, public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, have broader adverse impacts on the commercial construction market, consumer confidence and spending, and/or impact both the well-being of our employees and our ability to operate our facilities. These types of disruptions or other events outside of our control could affect our business negatively, cause delays or cancellation of commercial construction projects or cause us to temporarily close our facilities, harming our operating results. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our manufacturing, finishing or distribution facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, political crises, public health crises, or other catastrophic events or events outside of our control, our business and operating results could suffer.\nNew competitors or specific actions of our existing competitors could materially harm our business\nWe operate in competitive industries in which the actions of our existing competitors or new competitors could result in loss of customers and/or market share. Changes in our competitors' products, prices or services could negatively impact our share of demand, net sales or margins.\nOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Glass segments have seen an increase in imports of products into the U.S. from international suppliers due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. If foreign imports occur at increased levels for extended periods of time, our net sales and margins in those segments could be negatively impacted.\nOur LSO segment competes with several international specialty glass manufacturers and international and domestic acrylic suppliers. If these competitors are able to successfully improve their product attributes, service capabilities and production capacity and/or increase their sales and marketing focus in the U.S. custom picture framing market, this segment's net sales and margins could be negatively impacted.\nOur customer dependence in the LSO segment creates a significant risk of reduced demand for our products\nThe LSO segment is highly dependent on a relatively small number of customers for its sales, while working to grow in new markets and with new customers. Accordingly, loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction in pricing, or a shift to a less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass or acrylic products for one or more of those customers could materially reduce LSO net sales and operating results. Many customers in this segment temporarily closed retail outlets, during a portion of fiscal 2021, as a result of \"stay in place\" orders within the United States, resulting in reduced demand for our product. We are unable to estimate the severity or longer-term impact resulting from this COVID-19 pandemic on our business in this segment.\nOperational Risks\nIf we are not able effectively to utilize and manage our manufacturing capacity, our results of operations will be negatively affected\nNear-term performance depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to provide sufficient available capacity and appropriately utilize existing production capacity. The failure to successfully maintain existing capacity, or manage unanticipated interruptions in production, successfully implement planned capacity expansions, and/or make timely investments in additional physical capacity and supporting technology systems could adversely affect our operating results.\nLoss of key personnel and inability to source sufficient labor could adversely affect our operating results\nOur success depends on the skills of the Company's leadership, construction project managers and other key technical personnel, and our ability to secure sufficient manufacturing and installation labor. In recent years, strong residential and commercial construction and low U.S. unemployment has caused increased competition for experienced construction project managers and other labor. If we are unable to retain existing employees, provide a safe and healthy working environment, and/or recruit and train additional employees with the requisite skills and experience, our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively, including availability and price of materials used in our products, our results of operations will be negatively affected\nOur Architectural Framing Systems and Architectural Services segments use aluminum as a significant input to their products. While we structure many of our supply agreements in a way to moderate the effects of fluctuations in the market for raw aluminum and we endeavor to adjust our pricing to offset potential impacts, operating results could be negatively impacted by price movements in the market for raw aluminum. In recent years, we have seen increased volatility in the price of aluminum that we purchase from both domestic and international sources. Due to our Architectural Framing Systems segment presence in Canada, we have significant cross-border activity, as our Canadian businesses purchase inputs from U.S.-based suppliers and sell to U.S.-based customers. A significant change in U.S. trade policy with Canada could, therefore, have an adverse impact on our net sales and operating results.\nOur Architectural Glass and LSO segments use raw glass as a significant input to their products. We periodically experience a tighter supply of raw glass when there is growth in automotive manufacturing and residential and non-residential construction. Failure to acquire a sufficient amount of raw glass on terms as favorable as current terms, including as a result of a significant unplanned downtime or shift in strategy at one or more of our key suppliers, could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles. Global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses, including recent impacts from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of one or more suppliers may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier or suppliers, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf we encounter problems with distribution, our ability to deliver our products to market could be adversely affected. Our operations are vulnerable to interruptions in the event of work stoppages, whether due to health concerns, such as COVID-19 or otherwise, labor disputes or shortages, and natural disasters that may affect our distribution and transportation to job sites. Moreover, our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to data and system security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. If we encounter problems with our distribution systems, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, manage transportation-related costs, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected.\nProduct quality issues and product liability claims could adversely affect our operating results\nWe manufacture and/or install a significant portion of our products based on the specific requirements of each customer. We believe that future orders of our products or services will depend on our ability to maintain the performance, reliability, quality and timely delivery standards required by our customers. We have in the past and are currently subject to product liability and warranty claims, including certain legal claims related to a commercial sealant product formerly incorporated into our products. If our products have performance, reliability or quality problems, or products are installed using incompatible glazing materials or installed improperly (by us or a customer), we may experience additional warranty expense; reduced or canceled orders; higher manufacturing or installation costs; or delays in the collection of accounts receivable. Additionally, product liability and warranty claims, including relating to the performance, reliability or quality of our products and services, could result in costly and time-consuming litigation that could require significant time and attention of management and involve significant monetary damages that could negatively impact our operating results. There is also no assurance that the number and value of product liability and warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that coverage under insurance policies, if applicable, will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against us. If we are unable to recover on an insurance claims, in whole or in part, or if we exhaust our available insurance coverage at some point in the future, then we might be forced to expend legal fees and settlement or judgment costs, which could negatively impact our profitability, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nProject management and installation issues could adversely affect our operating results\nSome of our segments are awarded fixed-price contracts that include material supply and installation services. Often, bids are required before all aspects of a construction project are known. An underestimate in the amount of labor required and/or cost of materials for a project; a change in the timing of the delivery of product; system design errors; difficulties or errors in execution; or significant project delays, caused by us or other trades, could result in failure to achieve the expected results. Any one or more of such issues could result in losses on individual contracts that could negatively impact our operating results.\nRisks related to acquisitions and integration activities could adversely affect our operating results\nWe have completed and may complete additional acquisitions in the future to accelerate the execution of our growth strategies, including new geographies, adjacent market sectors and new product introductions. There are risks inherent in completing acquisitions, including:\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing business activities;\n\u2022difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings and synergies;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on relationships with existing customers and suppliers;\n\u2022adverse impact on overall profitability if the acquired business does not achieve the return on investment projected at the time of acquisition; and\n\u2022with respect to the acquired assets and liabilities, inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition capital investments; undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities; problems executing backlog of material supply or installation projects; unanticipated costs; and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs.\nIf one or more of these risks were to arise in a material manner, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nDifficulties in maintaining our information technology systems, and potential security threats, could negatively affect our operating results and/or our reputation\nOur operations are dependent upon various information technology systems that are used to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support our manufacturing operations and a variety of other business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in maintaining our existing systems, and developing and implementing new systems. Such difficulties could lead to disruption in business operations and/or significant additional expenses that could adversely affect our results.\nAdditionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology and Internet based systems have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access, breach, malfeasance or other system disruptions, none of which have been material to us to date. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and product specifications, production downtimes, disruption in the availability of financial data, or misrepresentation of information via digital media. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, project delay claims, and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection systems.\nViolations of legal and regulatory compliance requirements, including environmental laws, and changes in existing legal and regulatory requirements, may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state laws and regulatory agencies, including laws and regulations that apply specifically to U.S. public companies and laws and regulations applicable to our manufacturing and construction site operations. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and reporting standards may increase our general and administrative expenses, divert management time and attention, or limit our operational flexibility, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations. Additionally, new laws, rules, and regulations, or changes to existing laws or their interpretations, could create added legal and compliance costs and uncertainty for us.\nWe use hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations, and have air and water emissions that require controls. Accordingly, we are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the storage and use of hazardous materials and disposal of wastes. A violation of such laws and regulations, or a release of such substances, may expose us to various claims, including claims by third parties, as well as remediation costs and fines.\nFinancial Risks\nDue to our self-insurance programs, we may have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the event of a material product liability claim\nWe obtain third-party insurance to provide coverage for potential risk in areas such as employment practices, workers' compensation, directors and officers, automobile, architect's and engineer's errors and omissions, product rework and general liability, as well as medical insurance and various other coverages. However, we retain a high amount of risk on a self-insured basis, partially through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Therefore, a material architectural product liability event could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nForeign currency effects could negatively affect our sales and operating income\nWhen the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, imports of products into the U.S. produced by international competitors become more price competitive and exports of our U.S.-fabricated products become less price competitive. If we are not able to counteract these types of price pressures through superior quality and service, our net sales and operating income could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our international subsidiaries report their results of operations and financial position in their relevant functional currencies (local country currency), which are then translated into U.S. dollars. As the relationship between these currencies and the U.S. dollar changes, there could be a negative impact on our reported results and financial position.\nResults can differ significantly from our expectations and the expectations of analysts, which could have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock\nOur sales and earnings guidance and resulting external analyst estimates are largely based on our view of our business and the broader commercial construction market. Further, there is additional risk in our ability to accurately forecast and provide guidance in the current environment, given the evolving conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn. Failure to meet our guidance or analyst expectations for net sales and earnings would have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may experience further impairment of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, in the future, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations\nOur assets include a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The assessment of impairment involves significant judgment and projections about future performance.\nBased on our analysis performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we determined impairment of goodwill at two of our reporting units within the Architectural Framing Systems segment, EFCO and Sotawall, and we determined impairment of the EFCO tradename. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment expense of $63.8 million and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment expense of $6.3 million. Refer to additional information included within Notes 1 and 6 to the Financial Statements contained in Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe discounted cash flow projections and revenue projections used in these analyses are dependent upon achieving forecasted levels of revenue and profitability. If revenue or profitability were to fall below forecasted levels, or if market conditions were to decline in a material or sustained manner, further impairment could be indicated at these or our other reporting units and we could incur an additional non-cash impairment expense that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14526, "SIC": 3442, "TIC": "APOG"}
