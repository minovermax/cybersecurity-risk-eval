a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread worldwide and to every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and on March 13, 2020 the United States declared a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This outbreak has severely impacted global economic activity and many countries and states in the United States have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating school and business closures and limiting travel.\nOur clients, the Corps, private clients and other federal or state agencies, have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts have led to delays in some of our projects. If the pandemic is prolonged, it may lead to additional delays or cancelations in current or future projects. Funds for dredging projects may also be diverted for public health, economic, or other priorities. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its effect on global economies and financial markets, including any recession or economic downturn that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nIn addition to project delays, the COVID-19 pandemic may affect, our business, including, but not limited to, in the following ways:\n\u2022\nWhile much of our client base is federal, state, or other governmental entities, some of our clients may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner, including as a result of deteriorating financial conditions or bankruptcy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts. Further, other third parties, such as suppliers, subcontractors, and other outside business partners, may experience significant disruptions in their ability to fulfill their obligations toward us, or they may not be unable to fulfill their obligations to us at all.\n\u2022\nMuch of our work is conducted on vessels, where our crew is required to live for extended periods of time. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, temporary work stoppages because of viral outbreaks on board our vessels. Temporary work stoppages may lead to decreased revenue and affect our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients\u2019 projects.\n\u2022\nThe Biden Administration has issued an executive order, that while currently stayed, requires federal contractors to, among other things, ensure the vaccination of all employees against COVID-19, and to require all subcontractors to do the same. If these, or other federal, state or local government mandates are reinstated or enacted, we may not be\nable to find employees and subcontractors who will qualify under then-in-effect mandate requirements, which may impair our ability to successfully perform federal contracts.\n\u2022\nOur vaccination requirements have limited, and may continue to result in limiting our ability to find qualified personnel to perform the duties required under our contracts.\n\u2022\nViral outbreaks on board our vessels have required us, and may continue to require us, to incur additional expenses to protect the health and safety of our employees, our clients, and other business partners. These costs include regular, mandated testing for our employees before they leave their homes and travel to the vessel, before they board the vessel, and before they leave the vessel to return home; disinfection of vessels; costs associated with accommodations for crew members who are quarantined or otherwise unable to board a vessel or return home; and overtime costs associated with the extended length of time crew members may be required to work or be available because of COVID-19 safety measures.\n\u2022\nIn addition to existing travel restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could impair our ability to support our operations and clients (both domestic and international), to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify, pursue and capture new business opportunities, and which could restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces. We also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any future government orders or other measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022\nCOVID-19 travel restrictions have limited, and may continue to limit, the ability of our senior personnel to conduct on-site project visits, which may lead to operational inefficiencies and may negatively impact the performance of our projects.\nWe are unable at this time to quantify the extent to which the continued global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the duration and magnitude of such impacts. The impacts from this unprecedented global event will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There may be other adverse consequences to our business, financial condition and results of operations from the spread of COVID-19 that we have not considered or have not become apparent. As a result, we cannot assure you that if the COVID-19 pandemic persists or worsens, it would not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business\nA reduction in government funding for dredging or other contracts, or government cancellation of such contracts, could materially adversely affect our business operations, revenues and profits.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from federal government contracts, particularly dredging contracts. Revenues related to dredging contracts with federal agencies or companies operating under contracts with federal agencies and the percentage as a total of dredging revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nAmounts spent by the federal government on dredging are subject to the budgetary and legislative processes. We would expect the federal government to continue to improve and maintain ports as it has for many years, which will necessitate a certain level of federal spending. However, there can be no assurance that the federal government will allocate any particular amount or level of funds to be spent on dredging projects for any specified period. In addition, Congress must approve budgets that govern spending by many of the federal agencies we support. When Congress is unable to agree on budget priorities, and thus is unable to pass the annual budget on a timely basis, Congress typically enacts a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution allows U.S. federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle. Under a continuing resolution, funding may not be available for new projects or may be delayed on current projects. Any such funding delays would likely result in new projects being delayed or canceled and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. Furthermore, a failure to complete the budget process and fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution may result in a U.S. federal government shutdown. An extended shutdown may result in us incurring substantial costs without reimbursement under our contracts and the delay or cancellation of key projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nIn addition, potential contract cancellations, modifications, protests, suspensions or terminations may arise from resolution of these issues and could cause our revenues, profits and cash flows to be lower. Federal government contracts can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government, subject to, in most cases, our contractual right to recover our actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not cancel any federal government contracts that have been or are awarded to us. Even if a contract is not cancelled, the government may elect to not award further work pursuant to a contract. There is no guarantee that the current Administration will not divert funds away from the Corps or from our other customers relying on funding from the federal government. There is also no guarantee that additional national emergencies will not be declared in the future. A significant reduction in government funding for dredging or remediation contracts could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.\nOur inability to qualify as an eligible bidder for government contracts or to compete successfully with other qualified bidders for certain contracts could materially adversely affect our business operations, revenues and profits.\nThe U.S. government and various state, local and foreign government agencies conduct rigorous competitive processes for awarding many contracts. Some contracts include multiple award task order contracts in which several contractors are selected as eligible bidders for future work. We will face strong competition and pricing pressures for any additional contract awards from the U.S. government and other domestic and foreign government agencies, and we may be required to qualify or continue to qualify under various multiple award task order contract criteria. Further, much of our work depends on our compliance with environmental and other regulations. Any claim by the government that we have violated any laws or regulations could result in our suspension or debarment from bidding for or being awarded government contracts. Our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder under government contract criteria could preclude us from competing for certain government contract awards. In addition, our inability to qualify as an eligible bidder, or to compete successfully when bidding for certain government contracts and to win those contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, operations, revenues and profits.\nOur significant number of fixed-price contracts subjects us to risks associated with cost over-runs, operating cost inflation and potential claims for liquidated damages. If we are unable to accurately estimate our project costs our profitability could suffer.\nWe conduct our business under various types of contracts where costs are estimated in advance of our performance. Most dredging contracts are fixed-price contracts where the customer pays a fixed price per unit (e.g., cubic yard) of material dredged. Fixed-price contracts carry inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, operational difficulties, and other changes that can occur over the contract period. If our estimates prove inaccurate, if there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated conditions or technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, inclement or hazardous weather conditions, changes in cost of equipment or materials, or our suppliers\u2019 or subcontractor\u2019s inability to perform, then cost over-runs and delays in performance are likely to occur. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred, or may be delayed in receiving necessary approvals or payments. Additionally, we may be required to pay liquidated damages upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts. If we were to significantly underestimate the costs on one or more significant contracts, the resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly based on the timing of contract awards and performance.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations have fluctuated from period to period in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Accordingly, you should not rely on the results of any past quarter or quarters as an indication of future performance in our business operations or valuation of our stock. Our operating results could vary greatly from period to period due to factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe timing of contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts;\n\u2022\ninclement or hazardous weather conditions that may result in underestimated delays in dredging, disruption or early termination of projects, unanticipated recovery costs or liability exposure, and additional contract expenses;\n\u2022\nplanned and unplanned equipment downtime, or equipment mobilization to and from projects, including those due to the impacts of COVID-19;\n\u2022\nour ability to recognize revenue from pending change orders, which is recognized only when the parties to a contract approve a modification that either creates new, or changes existing, enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental restrictions requiring that certain projects be performed in winter months to protect wildlife habitats.\nIf our results of operations from quarter to quarter fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively impacted. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Primary Factors that Determine Operating Profitability.\u201d\nIf we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could be subject to significant potential liabilities and loss of revenue.\nOur contracts with federal, state, local and foreign governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations and contract provisions. These regulations also subject us to examinations by government auditors and investigators, from time to time, to ensure compliance and to review costs. Violations of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, which could include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, imposition of payments and fines and suspension or debarment from future government contracting. If we fail to continue to qualify for or are suspended from work under a government contract for any reason, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn addition, we may be subject to litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts, referred to in this annual report as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Qui tam actions are sealed by the court at the time of filing. The only parties privy to the information in the complaint are the complainant, the U.S. government and the court. Therefore, it is possible that qui tam actions have been filed against us and that we are not aware of such actions or have been ordered by the court not to discuss them until the seal is lifted. Thus, it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure arising out of qui tam actions.\nCosts necessary to operate and maintain our vessels tend to increase with the age of the vessel, and costs of such maintenance, as well as costs associated with new build programs, may also increase due to changes in applicable regulations or standards, which could decrease our profits.\nCapital expenditures and other costs necessary to operate and maintain our vessels tend to increase with the age of the vessel. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of our vessels will increase.\nThe average age of our more significant vessels as of December 31, 2021, by equipment type, is as follows:\nRemaining economic life has not been presented, because it is not reasonably quantifiable. That is because, to the extent that market conditions warrant the expenditures, we can prolong the vessels\u2019 lives. In our domestic market, we operate in an industry where a significant portion of our competitors\u2019 equipment is of a similar age. It is common in the dredging industry to make maintenance and capital expenditures in order to extend the economic life of equipment.\nIn addition, changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations, standards imposed by vessel classification societies and customer requirements or competition, may require us to make significant additional expenditures. For example, if the U.S. Coast Guard enacts new standards, we may be required to incur expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment (e.g. more fuel-efficient engines). In order to satisfy any such requirements, we may need to take our vessels out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues.\nEquipment or mechanical failures could result in increased costs, project delays and reduced revenues.\nThe successful performance of contracts requires a high degree of reliability of our vessels, barges and other equipment. The average age of our marine fleet as of December 31, 2021 was 23 years. Breakdowns not only add to the costs of executing a project, but they can also delay the completion of subsequent contracts, which are scheduled to utilize the same assets. We operate a scheduled maintenance program in order to keep all assets in good working order, but despite this, breakdowns can and do occur, resulting in loss of revenue.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease affecting our markets or impacting our facilities or suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nIf another pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis, including an unexpected increase in COVID-19 infections, were to affect our markets or facilities or those of our suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. Another pandemic or the continuation or an increase of the current COVID-19 pandemic could cause disruptions in and restrictions on our ability to travel, and in the future these disruptions and restrictions could restrict our ability to perform work for future projects in different locations. If an infectious disease were to have a widespread outbreak at one or more of our vessels or facilities, our operations may be affected significantly, our productivity may be affected, key personnel necessary to conduct our operations or replacement crew may be unavailable, our ability to complete projects in accordance with our contractual obligations may be affected, and we may incur increased labor and materials costs. If the shipyards with which we contract were affected by an outbreak of infectious disease, repairs of our vessels as well as new construction may be delayed and we may incur increased labor and materials costs. In addition, we may experience difficulties with certain suppliers or with vendors in their supply chains, and our business could be affected if we become unable to procure essential supplies or services in adequate quantities and at acceptable prices.\nOur clients, which are the Corps, private clients and other federal, state or local agencies, may be impacted by a pandemic, and if prolonged, these impacts may lead to cancelations or delays in projects. Funds for dredging projects may also be diverted for public health, economic, or other priorities. Overall, the potential impact of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease with respect to our markets or our facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business.\nDisruptions to our supply chain affecting our markets or impacting our facilities or suppliers could prohibit procurement of new vessel build materials and adversely impact our business.\nSupply chain issues could cause disruptions that restrict our ability to perform work for future projects. Our ability to complete projects in accordance with our contractual obligations may be affected, and we may incur increased labor and materials costs. If the shipyards with which we contract are affected, repairs of our vessels as well as new construction may be delayed and we may incur increased labor and materials costs. In addition, we may experience difficulties with certain suppliers or with vendors in their supply chains, and our business could be affected if we become unable to procure essential supplies or services in adequate quantities and at acceptable prices.\nOur international dredging operations subject us to competitive, political, regulatory and other risks.\nRevenue from foreign contracts and its percentage to total dredging revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nThe international dredging market is highly competitive, and competition in the international market is dominated by four large European dredging companies, all of which operate larger equipment and fleets that are more modern and extensive than the Company\u2019s. In addition, there are several governmentally supported dredging companies that operate on a local or regional basis. Competing for international dredging projects requires a substantial investment of resources, skilled personnel and capital investment in equipment and technology, and may adversely affect our ability to deploy resources for domestic dredging projects.\nInternational operations subject us to additional potential risks, including:\n\u2022\nuncertainties concerning import and export license requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and risks of terrorist activities;\n\u2022\nreduced demand as a result of fluctuations in the price of oil, the primary export in the Middle East;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual rights and agreements through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nrequirements of, and changes in, foreign laws, policies and regulations;\n\u2022\nlocal licensing, permitting and royalty issues, particularly with respect to our overseas operations in Bahrain and the Middle East;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations without additional expense;\n\u2022\ntaxation issues;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and international anticorruption laws;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlogistical and communication challenges; and\n\u2022\ninability to effectively insure against political, cultural and economic uncertainties, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, war or other armed conflict.\nIn addition, our international operations are subject to U.S. and other laws and regulations regarding operations in foreign jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include anti-boycott laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, immigration laws, privacy laws and accounting requirements. There is a risk that some provisions may be breached, for example through inadvertence or mistake, fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees or of agents, or failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to operate in one or more countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, military action, terrorist activities or continued unrest in the Middle East could affect the safety of our personnel in the region and significantly increase the costs of, or disrupt our operations in, the region and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nRegional instability in the Middle East may adversely affect business conditions and may disrupt our operations.\nSaudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Middle East countries have experienced political turbulence in the recent past. Political uprisings and conflicts, including armed hostilities and civil unrest, may affect the political stability of the region. Tensions in the region between the U.S. and Iran have escalated, resulting in increased military and militia activity in Iraq and other Middle East countries. In addition, there has been a decline in the relationships between and amongst certain governments in the Middle East, such as continued conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nDeterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, could materially and adversely affect our business, access to markets, financial condition, and results of operations. Similar civil unrest and political turbulence has occurred in other countries in the region.\nIn addition, such events may affect plans for infrastructure investment. If the government changes or significant restrictions are established, our dredging operations in the Middle East, including the value of our assets related to such operations, may be adversely affected.\nEnvironmental regulations could force us to incur capital and operational costs.\nOur industries, and more specifically, our operations, facilities and vessels and equipment, are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things: dredging operations; the disposal of dredged material; protection of wetlands; storm water and waste water discharges; transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes and other regulated materials; air emissions; and disposal or remediation of contaminated soil, sediments, surface water and groundwater. We are also subject to laws designed to protect certain marine or land species and habitats. Compliance with these statutes and regulations can delay permitting and/or performance of particular projects and increase related project costs. These delays and increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Non-compliance can also result in fines, penalties and claims by third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury, as well as damages to property and natural resources and suspension or debarment from future government contracting.\nCertain environmental laws such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 impose strict and, under some circumstances, joint and several, liability on owners and lessees of land and facilities as well as owners and operators of vessels. Such obligations may include investigation and remediation of releases and discharges of regulated materials, and also impose liability for related damages to natural resources. Our past and ongoing operations involve the use, and from time to time the release or discharge, of regulated materials which could result in liability under these and other environmental laws. We have remediated known releases and discharges as deemed necessary, but there can be no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred if, for example, third party claims arise or new conditions are discovered.\nOur projects may involve excavation, remediation, demolition, transportation, management and disposal of hazardous waste and other regulated materials. Various laws strictly regulate the removal, treatment and transportation of hazardous waste and other regulated materials and impose liability for human health effects and environmental contamination caused by these materials. Services rendered in connection with hazardous substance and material removal and site development may involve professional judgments by\nlicensed experts about the nature of soil conditions and other physical conditions, including the extent to which hazardous substances and materials are present, and about the probable effect of procedures to mitigate problems or otherwise affect those conditions. If the judgments and the recommendations based upon those judgments are incorrect, we may be liable for resulting damages, which may be material. The failure of certain contractual protections to protect us from incurring such liability, such as staying out of the ownership chain for hazardous waste and other regulated materials and securing indemnification obligations from our customers or subcontractors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, revenues or profits.\nEnvironmental requirements have generally become more stringent over time, for example in the areas of air emissions controls for vessels and ballast treatment and handling. New laws or stricter enforcement of existing laws or, the discovery of currently unknown conditions or accidental discharges of regulated materials in the future could cause us to incur additional costs for environmental matters which might be significant.\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nIncreased concern about the potential impact of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d), such as carbon dioxide resulting from combustion of fossil fuels, on climate change has resulted in efforts to regulate their emission. Legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on GHG emissions could also affect our customers. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for our customers or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Additionally, in our normal course of operations, we use a significant amount of fossil fuels. The costs of controlling our GHG emissions or obtaining required emissions allowances in response to any regulatory change in our industry could increase materially.\nPenalties for late completion of contracts could reduce our profits.\nIn many instances, including in our fixed-price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be liable for any customer losses resulting from such delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. In addition, failure to maintain a required schedule could cause us to default on our government contracts, giving rise to a variety of potential damages. To the extent that these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates, and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project.\nForce majeure events could negatively impact our business, operations, revenues, cash flows and profits.\nForce majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters, as well as terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate. We typically negotiate contract language where we are allowed certain relief from force majeure events in private client contracts and review and attempt to mitigate force majeure events in both public and private client contracts. We remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events subject to relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause.\nIf a contract contains a force majeure provision, we may be able to obtain an extension of time to complete our obligations under such contract, but we will still be subject to our other contractual obligations in the event of such an extraordinary event. Because we cannot predict the length, severity or location of any potential force majeure event, it is not possible to determine the specific effects any such event may have on us. Depending on the specific circumstances of any particular force majeure event, or if we are unable to react quickly to such an event, our operations may be affected significantly, our productivity may be affected, our ability to complete projects in accordance with our contractual obligations may be affected, our payments from customers may be delayed and we may incur increased labor and materials costs, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, relationships with customers or suppliers, and our reputation.\nThe amount of our estimated backlog may change and may not be indicative of future revenues.\nOur contract backlog represents our estimate of the revenues that we will realize under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed. These estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site, the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work. However, these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances. From time to time, changes in project scope may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the timing of the revenue and profits that we actually earn. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services or equipment required by the project.\nBecause of these factors, as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues or profitability. In addition, a significant amount of our backlog (62% as of December 31, 2021) relates to federal\ngovernment contracts, which can be canceled at any time without penalty to the government, subject, in most cases, to our contractual right to recover our actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation.\nBelow is our backlog from federal government contracts as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and the percentage of those contracts to total backlog as of the same date.\nAt times we may have backlog with foreign governments that use local laws and regulations to change terms of a contract in backlog or to limit our ability to receive payment on a timely basis. Other contracts in backlog are with state and local municipalities or private companies that may have funding constraints or impose restrictions on timing. The termination, modification or suspension of projects currently in backlog could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nLoss of a single customer contract could significantly decrease revenue.\nProspective customers may be incentivized to use another dredging company other than the Company. The Company could lose future contracts for work to competitors or could be forced to accept lower margins on contracts. Lower utilization, workforce reductions or asset relocations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nWhile the Company does not currently have significant operations or equipment in the Middle East, we may seek contracts there in the future. Certain factors have occurred suggesting that future revenues from projects with governments in the Middle East could decrease. Historically lower oil prices and the contraction in Middle East commercial and real estate development have slowed the rate of the region\u2019s infrastructure development. If the diplomatic relationship of the United States or our commercial relationship with governments in the Middle East is significantly negatively impacted or terminated, or we encounter significant difficulties in obtaining licensing or permits to do business in these countries, the Company\u2019s international revenues would be materially and adversely impacted. If the government of Bahrain or Saudi Arabia further curtails its infrastructure investment or diversifies its use of dredging vendors, our revenue from these customers could decline further.\nInability to obtain secure financing or financing on favorable terms for our new vessels.\nWe have previously disclosed our plans to build new vessels which requires significant capital expenditures. Unforeseen issues could arise in our ability to obtain secure financing or to obtain secure financing on terms favorable to us for building such vessels. This includes our new offshore wind vessel and other potential future vessels. The inability to obtain favorable financing may also impact our ability to bring the new vessels into service within the timeline anticipated by the Company, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and/or results of operations.\nInability to secure contracts to utilize new offshore wind vessel.\nWe have previously disclosed the build of our new offshore wind vessel that is in progress. Our ability to obtain customers and/or contracts on terms favorable to the Company to utilize this new vessel for subsea rock installation for wind turbines could be impacted by unforeseen market conditions. As the costs to build this new vessel have already been incurred, the lack of a secure customer base and favorable secure contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nUnforeseen delays and cost overruns could delay or halt plans to build new vessels and, as a result, negatively impact our business strategy.\nWe have previously disclosed our plans to build new vessels. Unknown mechanical or engineering issues involving new vessels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Our future revenues and profitability will also be impacted to some extent by our ability to secure financing for new vessels and bring them into service within the timeline anticipated by the Company. The Company contracts with shipyards to build new vessels and currently has vessels under construction. Construction projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns, resulting from shortages of equipment, materials and skilled labor; lack of shipyard availability; unforeseen design and engineering problems; work stoppages; weather interference; unanticipated cost increases; unscheduled delays in the delivery of material and equipment; and financial and other difficulties at\nshipyards including labor disputes, shipyard insolvency and inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals. A significant delay in the construction of new vessels or a shipyard\u2019s inability to perform under the construction contract could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill contract commitments and to realize timely revenues with respect to vessels under construction. Significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations and customer requirements or competition, could also substantially increase the cost of such construction beyond what we currently expect such costs to be.\nWe have previously disclosed our plans to expand into the offshore wind market. Unknown changes to environmental needs and regulations and changes in the policies of the U.S. Presidential Administration could delay or halt plans to expand our new offshore wind projects, which would adversely impact our business strategy and affect the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Our future revenues and profitability will also be impacted to some extent if we are unable to obtain favorable steel prices or unable to obtain secure financing for new offshore wind vessels and bring them into service within the timeline anticipated by the Company.\nOur business would be adversely affected if we failed to comply with Jones Act provisions on coastwise trade, or if those provisions were modified or repealed.\nWe are subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict dredging in U.S. waters and maritime transportation between points in the United States to vessels operating under the U.S. flag, built in the United States, at least 75% owned and operated by U.S. citizens and manned by U.S. crews. We are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our common stock to ensure compliance with these laws. If we do not comply with these restrictions, we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the U.S. market, and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. dredging rights for our vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels.\nIn the past, interest groups have unsuccessfully lobbied Congress to modify or repeal the Jones Act to facilitate foreign flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. flag vessels under the Jones Act. We believe that continued efforts may be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act or other federal laws currently benefiting U.S. flag vessels. If these efforts are ever successful, it could result in significantly increased competition and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur operating costs depend significantly on the price of petroleum-based products, and price increases could adversely affect our profits.\nFuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. We use diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products to operate our equipment used in our dredging contracts. Fluctuations in supplies relative to demand and other factors can cause unanticipated increases in their cost. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. In addition, the International Maritime Organization issued regulations regarding use of low sulfur fuel, which has increased the demand for low sulfur fuel. We use low sulfur fuel in many of our domestic operations, and future increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products used in our business, particularly if a bid has been submitted for a contract and the costs of those products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs thereof, could result in a lower profit, or even a loss, on one or more contracts.\nOur investing and operating costs depend significantly on the prices of new build materials, and price increases due to high nationwide inflation could adversely affect our profits.\nThe prices of steel and other materials to build and develop new vessels fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher material costs during a contract term. When renewing contracts, we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting the rising costs of inflation. Such future increases in the costs of steel and other materials used to build new vessels, particularly if a bid or renewal has been submitted for a contract and the costs of the required products have been estimated at amounts less than the actual costs incurred, could result in a lower profit, or even a loss, on one or more contracts.\nAn inability to obtain bonding or letters of credit would limit our ability to obtain future contracts, which could, along with any draws on existing arrangements, adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are generally required to post bonds in connection with our domestic dredging contracts and bonds or letters of credit with our foreign dredging contracts to ensure job completion if we ever fail to finish a project. We have entered into bonding agreements with the sureties, or the \u201cSureties\u201d, pursuant to which the Sureties issue bid bonds, performance bonds and payment bonds, and provide guarantees required by us in the day-to-day operations of our dredging business. The Company also has outstanding bonds with Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America and Zurich. Historically, we have had a strong bonding capacity, but surety companies issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing any bonds. With respect to our foreign dredging business, we generally obtain letters of credit under our Amended Credit Agreement. However, access to our senior credit facility under our Amended Credit Agreement may be limited by failure to meet certain levels of availability or other defined financial or other requirements. If we are unable to obtain bonds or letters of credit on terms reasonably acceptable to us, our ability to take on future work would be severely limited.\nIn connection with the sale of our historical demolition business, we were obligated to keep in place the surety bonds on pending demolition projects for the period required under the respective contract for a project. In 2017, we were notified by Zurich of an alleged default triggered on a historical demolition surety performance bond in the aggregate amount of approximately $20 million for failure of the contractor to perform in accordance with the terms of a project. Zurich drew upon the letter of credit in the amount of $20.9 million. In order to fund the draw on the letter of credit, we had to increase the borrowings on our revolving credit facility. As the outstanding letters of credit previously reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility, this draw down on our letter of credit did not impact our liquidity or capital availability. However, in the future, other defaults (or alleged defaults) triggered under any of our surety bonds could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAcquisitions involve integration, consolidation and strategic risks and may involve significant transaction expenses and unexpected liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may seek business acquisition activities as a means of broadening our offerings and capturing additional market opportunities by our business units. We may be exposed to certain additional risks resulting from these activities. Acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe effects of valuation methodologies which may not accurately capture the value proposition;\n\u2022\nthe failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, financial reporting and controls with the efficiency and effectiveness initially expected resulting in a potentially significant detriment to our financial results and our operations as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe management of the growth resulting from acquisition activities;\n\u2022\nthe inability to capitalize on expected synergies;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of liabilities of an acquired business (for example, litigation, tax liabilities, environmental liabilities), including liabilities that were contingent or unknown at the time of the acquisition and that pose future risks to our working capital needs, cash flows and the profitability of related operations;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unprofitable projects that pose future risks to our working capital needs, cash flows and the profitability of related operations;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with entering new markets;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key personnel, customers or contracts of any acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential adverse effects on our ability to comply with covenants in our existing debt financing;\n\u2022\npotential impairment of acquired intangible assets; and\n\u2022\nadditional debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms.\nWe may not have the appropriate management, financial or other resources needed to integrate any businesses that we acquire. Any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses and unexpected liabilities.\nDivestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, and any retained liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs part of our strategic process, we review our operations for assets and businesses which may no longer be aligned with our strategic initiatives and long-term objectives. For example, we have divested our historical environmental & infrastructure business and historical demolition business. We continue to review our assets and strategy and may pursue additional divestitures. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including required separation or carve-out activities and costs, disputes with buyers or potential impairment charges. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had previously anticipated or fail to close a transaction at all. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement, as we may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against contingent liabilities related to businesses sold, such as lawsuits, surety obligations, tax liabilities, or environmental matters. It may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party stemmed from actions taken by us or by another party and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine which party has responsibility for the claim. Under these types of arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect future financial results and such claims or conditions may divert management attention from our continuing business.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, the Company completed the sale of its historical demolition business. In connection with the sale, the Company retained responsibility for various pre-closing liabilities and obligations and may incur costs and expenses related to these items and asset recoveries. It is possible that claims, which could be material, could be made against the Company by virtue of the agreement pursuant to which the Company\u2019s historical demolition business was sold. In connection with the sale of our historical demolition business, we were obligated to keep in place the surety bonds on pending demolition projects for the period required under the respective contract for a project. As noted above, if there should be a default (or alleged default) triggered under any of the surety bonds for the historical demolition business, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain bonds and on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, the Company completed the sale of the historical environmental & infrastructure business. The Company retained responsibility for pre-closing liabilities and indemnification for breaches of our representations and warranties in the sale agreement. If the buyer made a claim against any of our indemnifications or if any payments became due in connection with any pre-closing liability, they could be material to results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction or if we underestimated the valuation of the charge related to placing an asset held for sale in discontinued operations, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could face liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of certain legal and regulatory proceedings, including a pending legal proceeding in Louisiana.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. From time to time, we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. These include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical in the businesses in which we operate.\nIn particular, on April 22, 2021, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana filed a bill of information against the Company charging the Company with a negligent discharge violation of the Clean Water Act arising from a September 2016 oil spill. The spill occurred during the Company\u2019s Cheniere Ronquille project and resulted in the discharge of around one hundred sixty barrels of crude oil in Bay Long, Louisiana. The Company has cooperated with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and other relevant agencies in their investigation of the oil spill and on June 15, 2021, the Company pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor violation alleged in the bill of information and agreed to pay a fine of $1 million. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a settlement of a civil suit arising from the same matter. The Company remains subject to potential liability for restitution in connection with this criminal matter, and has deposited the potential liability for the criminal matter of $2 million into the registry of the court. That amount is presented as restricted cash in other noncurrent assets. As a result of the pending conviction, the government will likely initiate statutory debarment proceedings against us, which might prohibit us from bidding for, entering into or completing certain government projects. Although the Company does not know whether debarment proceedings will result in prohibitions, or the impact of any such resulting prohibitions, the Company does not expect any such proceedings or prohibitions to cause a material disruption to its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also currently a defendant in a number of other litigation matters, including those described in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts of damages. These matters are also subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters could\nultimately be decided, resolved or settled adversely to the Company. An adverse outcome in a legal or regulatory matter could, depending on the facts, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFurthermore, whether the ultimate outcomes are favorable or unfavorable, these matters can also have significant adverse reputational impacts, including negative publicity and press speculation about us, whether valid or not, which may be damaging to our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nLiabilities for the obligations of our joint ventures, partners and subcontractors could materially decrease our profitability and liquidity.\nSome of our projects are performed through joint ventures and similar arrangements with other parties. In addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work, if work is performed through a joint venture or similar arrangement, we also have potential liability for the work performed by the joint venture or arrangement or a performance or payment default by another member of the joint venture or arrangement. In these projects, even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget, we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of the other party or parties to the arrangement to perform or complete work, fund expenditures, or make payments in accordance with contract specifications. In some joint ventures and similar arrangements, we may not be the controlling member. In these cases, we may have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. In addition, joint ventures or arrangements may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. To the extent the controlling member makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or arrangement or internal control problems arise within the joint venture or arrangement, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nDepending on the nature of work required to complete the project, we may choose to subcontract a portion of the project. In our industries, the prime contractor is often responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, we are subject to risks associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated. In addition, in some cases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail to pay, or delay paying us for the related work, we could experience a material decrease in profitability and liquidity.\nNew tariffs have increased our costs and could adversely affect our business operations, revenues and profits.\nIn recent years, the United States has imposed Section 232 tariffs and other import taxes on certain steel and aluminum products, such as imported dredge-related machinery and pipes. These tariffs and other import taxes have increased the prices of these inputs. Increased prices for imported steel and aluminum products have led domestic sellers to respond with market-based increases to prices for such inputs as well. We cannot be sure of the ultimate effect such tariffs or any additional import taxes will have on our operating profits. If we are not able to pass these price increases on to our customers or to secure adequate alternative sources for such inputs on a timely basis, the tariffs and other import taxes may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, revenues and profits.\nOur business could suffer in the event of a work stoppage by our unionized labor force.\nWe are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. that govern our industry\u2019s relationships with our unionized hourly workforce. Two unions represent approximately 74% of our hourly dredging employees-the IUOE Local 25 and the Seafarers International Union. The Company\u2019s master and ancillary contracts with IUOE Local 25 expire in September 2024. The Company\u2019s master contract with Seafarers International Union expires in February 2023. The inability to successfully renegotiate contracts with these unions as they expire, or any future strikes, employee slowdowns or similar actions by one or more unions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\nLiabilities imposed by federal laws for job-related claims by seagoing employees could increase our costs and reduce our profitability.\nSubstantially all of our maritime employees are covered by provisions of the Jones Act, the U.S. Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the Seaman\u2019s Wage Act and general maritime law. These laws typically operate to make liability limits established by state workers\u2019 compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and to permit these employees and their representatives to pursue actions against employers for job-related injuries in federal or state courts. Because we are not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers\u2019 compensation statutes with respect to our seagoing employees, we have greater exposure for claims made by these employees as compared to industries whose employees are not covered by these provisions. Successful claims could materially increase our costs and reduce our profitability.\nThe significant operating risks and hazards inherent in the operation of our business could result in personal or property damage, which could result in losses or liabilities to us.\nThe dredging business is generally subject to a number of risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins below water levels, collisions, disruption of transportation services, flooding and unexploded ordnance. These risks could result in personal injury, damage to, or destruction of, dredges, barges transportation vessels, other maritime vessels, other structures, buildings or equipment, environmental damage, performance delays, monetary losses or legal liability to third parties. We may also be exposed to disruption of our operations, early termination of projects, unanticipated recovery costs and loss of use of our equipment that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur safety record is an important consideration for our customers. Some of our customers require that we maintain certain specified safety record guidelines to be eligible to bid for contracts with these customers. Furthermore, contract terms may provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some of our contract revenue in the event that our safety record fails to adhere to agreed-upon guidelines during performance of the contract. As a result, if serious accidents or fatalities occur or our safety record were to deteriorate, we may be ineligible to bid on certain work, and existing contracts could be terminated or less profitable than expected. Adverse experience with hazards and claims could have a negative effect on our reputation with our existing or potential new customers and our prospects for future work.\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified MBE or DBE contractors to perform as subcontractors, which could materially and adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nCertain of our government agency projects contain goals for minimum minority business enterprise (\u201cMBE\u201d) and/or disadvantaged business enterprise (\u201cDBE\u201d) participation clauses. If we subsequently fail to reach our goals for the minimum MBE and/or DBE participation, we may be held responsible for breach of contract, which may include restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects as well as monetary damages. To the extent we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nRisks Related to our Financing\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had indebtedness of $325.0 million, consisting of our senior subordinated notes. Currently, we have no borrowings on our revolving credit facility and approximately $25.1 million of undrawn letters of credit, leaving $174.5 million of additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. These figures exclude contingent obligations, including $1.2 billion of performance bonds outstanding under the Company\u2019s agreements with the Sureties and other bonding agreements. Our level of indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures, pay dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industries;\n\u2022\naffect our competitiveness compared to our less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincrease our exposure to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe and our subsidiaries also may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our revolving credit facility and the indenture under which our senior subordinated notes are issued limit, but do not prohibit, us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nCovenants in our financing arrangements limit, and other future financing agreements may limit, our ability to operate our business.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes contain, and any of our other future financing agreements may contain covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on our business.\nFor example, the credit agreement governing our senior revolving credit facility requires us to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio under certain circumstances. If we fail to satisfy such covenant, we would be in default and the lenders (through the\nadministrative agent or collateral agent, as applicable) could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests in the collateral pledged and/or restrict our ability to make additional borrowings, as applicable. The covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes, subject to specified exceptions and to varying degrees, restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume or permit to exist any liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into operating leases;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans and advancements;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or reorganize with, or dispose of all or substantially all assets to, a third party;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nprepay or redeem other indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nissue certain types of capital stock.\nThese restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financings or to engage in other business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may affect our ability to access capital and meet liquidity needs.\nThe domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets may experience significant volatility, disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability. Should we need additional funds or to refinance our existing indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain such additional funds or refinancing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer. The principal sources of our liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility. Earnings from our operations and our working capital requirements can vary significantly from period to period based primarily on the mix of our projects underway and the percentage of project work completed during the period. Capital expenditures may also vary significantly from period to period. While we manage cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditure needs, unpredictability in cash collections and payments has required us in the past and may in the future require us to borrow on our line of credit from time to time to meet the needs of our operations.\nIn the event these resources do not satisfy our liquidity needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreased due to a market downturn. If internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may be unable to maintain or expand our credit capacity, which would adversely affect our operations and business.\nWe use credit facilities to support our working capital and acquisition needs. If we exhaust our borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit Agreement, and cash flows from operations do not increase sufficiently, our ability to fund the working capital, capital expenditure and other needs of our existing operations could be constrained and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we experience operational difficulties or our operating results do not improve, we may need to increase our available borrowing capacity or seek amendments to the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement. Our Amended Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire on May 3, 2024. We strive to enter into new arrangements on terms that are more favorable than the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or alternatively that we will be able to secure any additional capacity or amend our Amended Credit Agreement or do so on terms that are acceptable to us, in which case, our costs of borrowing could rise and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRegulatory requirements for derivative transactions could adversely impact our ability to hedge interest rate, currency or commodity risks.\nWe may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate paid with respect to our fixed rate indebtedness, foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge currency risk and heating oil commodity swap contracts to hedge the risk that fluctuations in diesel fuel prices will have an adverse impact on cash flows associated with our domestic dredging contracts. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank\u201d) and regulations adopted by a number of U.S. federal regulatory agencies created a comprehensive statutory and regulatory framework for derivative transactions, including foreign currency and other over-the-counter derivative hedging transactions. While a number of provisions of Dodd-Frank have been implemented, certain key provisions have not yet been implemented or remain subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, certain provisions of Dodd-Frank may be modified or repealed in the future. Any substantial change in the financial regulatory environment could create additional new compliance costs for us or cause us to alter the manner in which we manage risk, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. The rules adopted or to be adopted under Dodd-Frank may significantly reduce our ability to execute strategic hedges to manage our interest expense, reduce our fuel commodity uncertainty and hedge our currency risk thus protecting our cash flows. In addition, the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties are required to comply with extensive regulation under Dodd-Frank. The cost of our counterparties\u2019 compliance will likely be passed on to customers such as ourselves, thus potentially decreasing the benefits to us of hedging transactions and potentially reducing our profitability.\nWe may be subject to foreign exchange risks, which could result in large cash losses.\nWe are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary foreign currencies to which the Company has exposure are the Euro, Korean Won and Bahraini dinar. We have unhedged foreign currency exposure related to the new inclined fall-pipe vessel for subsea rock installation build, in particular, as it relates to the procurement of steel for this build. Our international contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies, which will result in additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits.\nOur investments in, and extensions of payment terms for, privately financed projects could result in significant losses.\nWe have participated and may continue to participate in privately financed projects that enable state and local governments and other customers to finance dredging, such as dredging of local navigable waterways and lakes, coastal protection and infrastructure projects. These projects typically include the facilitation of non-recourse financing and the provision of dredging, environmental, infrastructure, and related services. We may incur contractually reimbursable costs and may accept extended payment terms, extend debt financing and/or make an equity investment in an entity prior to, in connection with, or as part of project financing, and in some cases we may be the sole or primary source of the project financing. Project financing may also involve the use of real estate, environmental, wetlands or similar credits. If a project is unable to obtain other financing on terms acceptable to it in amounts sufficient to repay or redeem our investments, we could incur losses on our investments and any related contractual receivables. After completion of these projects, the return on our equity investments can be dependent on the operational success of the project and market factors or sale of the aforementioned credits, which may not be under our control. As a result, we could sustain a loss of part or all of our equity investments in such projects or have to recognize the value of the credits at a lower amount than expected in the contract bid.\nRisks Related to our Stock\nOur common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership.\nWe are subject to government regulations pursuant to the Dredging Act, the Jones Act, the Shipping Act and the vessel documentation laws set forth in Chapter 121 of Title 46 of the United States Code. These statutes require vessels engaged in the transport of merchandise or passengers or dredging in the navigable waters of the U.S. to be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. The U.S. citizenship ownership and control standards require the vessel-owning entity to be at least 75% U.S.-citizen owned. Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting non-citizenship ownership of our capital stock. If our board of directors determines that persons who are not citizens of the U.S. own more than 22.5% of our outstanding capital stock or more than 22.5% of our voting power, we may redeem such stock. The required redemption price could be materially different from the current price of our common stock or the price at which the non-citizen acquired the common stock. If a non-citizen purchases our common stock, there can be no assurance that they will not be required to divest the shares and such divestiture could result in a material loss. Such restrictions and redemption rights may make our equity securities less attractive to potential investors, which may result in our common stock having a lower market price than it might have in the absence of such restrictions and redemption rights.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter, delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring us. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to amend our charter documents, including stockholder supermajority voting requirements;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and to issue additional shares of our common stock.\nWe are also subject to the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or stockholder approval was obtained.\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company, discourage others from making tender offers for our shares, lower the market price of our stock or impede the ability of our stockholders to change our management, even if such changes would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur stockholders may not receive dividends because of restrictions in our debt agreements or Delaware law.\nOur ability to pay dividends is restricted by the agreements governing our debt, including our Amended Credit Agreement, our bonding agreements and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes. In addition, under Delaware law, our board of directors may not authorize payment of a dividend unless it is either paid out of our surplus, as calculated in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, or, if we do not have a surplus, it is paid out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. To the extent we do not have adequate surplus or net profits, we will be prohibited from paying dividends.\nSignificant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock may affect the ability of holders to resell our common stock at prices that they find attractive.\nThe price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in market conditions;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economy and the financial markets;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions, such as acts or threats of terrorism, political instability, civil unrest or military conflicts.\nIn addition, in recent years, global stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results.\nVolatility in the financial markets could cause a decline in our stock price, which could trigger an impairment of the goodwill of individual reporting units that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. A significant drop in the price of our stock could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom are awarded equity securities, the value of which is dependent on the performance of our stock price.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur methods of accounting for recognizing revenue involve significant estimates and could result in a change in previously recorded revenue and profit.\nWe recognize revenue on our projects using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) including guidance from Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (commonly referred to as ASC 606) subsequent to year-end December 31, 2017. The majority of our work is performed on a fixed-price basis. Contract revenue is recorded over time based on estimates which we develop from information known to us at the time of recording, but which may change. The cumulative impact of revisions to estimates is reflected in the period in which these changes are experienced or become known. Given the risks associated with the variables in these types of estimates, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded net revenues and profits.\nOur current insurance coverage may not be adequate, and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all.\nWe maintain various insurance policies, including hull and machinery, pollution liability, general liability and personal injury. We partially self-insure risks covered by our policies. While we reserve for such self-insured exposures when appropriate for accounting purposes, we are not required to, and do not, specifically set aside funds for the self-insured portion of claims. We may not have insurance coverage or sufficient insurance coverage for all exposures potentially arising from a project. Furthermore, in situations where there is insurance coverage, if multiple policies are involved, we may be subject to a number of self-retention or deductible amounts which in the aggregate could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At any given time, we are subject to Jones Act personal injury claims and claims from general contractors and other third parties for personal injuries. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business. We may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain such insurance coverage at acceptable rates or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to find, attract and retain skilled labor and key personnel, including governance personnel, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain reliable, qualified personnel is a significant factor that enables us to successfully bid for and profitably complete our work. This includes members of our board of directors, management, project managers, estimators, skilled engineers, supervisors, foremen, equipment operators and laborers. The loss of the services of any of our management could have a material adverse effect on us. If we do not succeed in retaining our current key employees and attracting, developing and retaining new highly-skilled employees, our reputation may be harmed and our operations and future earnings may be negatively impacted. We may not be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. We have from time to time experienced, and may in the future experience, shortages of certain types of qualified equipment operating personnel. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, some difficulty finding skilled labor in the current labor shortage market. The supply of experienced engineers, project managers, field supervisors and other skilled workers may not be sufficient to meet current or expected demand. If we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills, we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn addition, any abrupt changes in our management or board of directors may lead to concerns regarding the direction or stability of our business, which may be exploited by our competitors, result in the loss of business opportunities, cause concern to our current or potential customers or suppliers, or make it more difficult to retain existing personnel or attract and retain new personnel. Changes in management or the board could be time-consuming, result in significant additional costs to us and could be disruptive of our operations and divert the time and attention of management and our employees away from our business operations and executing on our strategic plan. The unexpected loss of members of our board of directors or senior management team could be disruptive to our operations, jeopardize our ability to raise additional funding and have an adverse effect on our business. The failure of our directors or\nany new members of our board of directors or management to perform effectively could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruption, failure, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or security breaches of our IT systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems in order to achieve our business objectives, including to transmit and store electronic information, to capture knowledge of our business including vessel operation systems containing information about production, efficiency and vessel positioning, to conduct our accounting, financial and treasury activities, to store historical financial, project and proprietary information, to monitor our vessel maintenance and engine systems, and to communicate within the organization and with customers, suppliers, partners and other third parties. Our portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services and our enterprise IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters and computer system or network failures. The Company\u2019s IT systems may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks including malware, other computer viruses or malicious software, spoofing or phishing email attacks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data, the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of its data, loss or damage to its data delivery systems and other electronic security breaches. The failure or disruption of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and result in decreased performance, significant remediation costs, transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, failure to properly estimate the work or costs associated with projects, litigation and the loss of customers or suppliers. A significant disruption or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nImpairments to our goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which charge could materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We test goodwill annually for impairment in the third quarter of each year, or more frequently should circumstances dictate. A significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or our stock price falling below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would be required to record a non-cash charge against earnings, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 91665, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "GLDD"}
