RISK FACTORS.\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent to the oil and gas industry. The following discusses some of the key inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations. Other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this report also could adversely affect our business and operations, and these risk factors should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that may affect us.\nRisks Related to Recent Developments\nDue to our substantial liquidity concerns, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOn February 10, 2017, our lender sold our secured loan to PWCM Investment Company IC LLC, and certain financial institutions (collectively, the \"successor lender\") pursuant to a loan sale agreement between Enerjex, our former lender, and the successor lender. The successor lender purchased from our prior lender all of its right, title and interest in, to and under our credit agreement and loan documents, in exchange for (i) a cash payment of $5,000,000, (ii) a synthetic equity interest equal to 10% of the proceeds, after successor lenders realization of a 150% return on the cash purchase price within 5 years of the closing date, and (iii) at any time prior to February 10, 2022, Buyer may acquire the synthetic equity interest above. In connection with the loan sale agreement, we released our prior lender and its successors, including the successor lender, from any and all claims under the credit agreement and loan documents. The Company is seeking stockholder approval of this transaction at the annual meeting of its stockholders to be held on April 27, 2017.\nAlso on February 10, 2017, we and our subsidiaries and the successor lender entered into a binding letter agreement dated February 10, 2017, pursuant to which the successor lender would agree to forgive our existing secured loan in the approximate principal amount of $17,295,000, and in exchange enter into a secured promissory note (which we refer to as the \"restated secured note\") in the original principal amount of $4,500,000. So long as we repay the $3,300,000 in indebtedness on or prior to the maturity date, as extended, all other amounts payable under the restated secured note shall be forgiven.\nAs consideration for the loan forgiveness, and subject to obtaining stockholder approval prior to the closing, we agreed to convey to successor lender all of our right, title, and interest, in and to all real property leases and oil and gas producing properties and other assets situated in the States of Colorado, Texas and Nebraska, including all our equipment and tangible personal property owned and used in connection with our ownership and operation of those real property leases and oil and gas producing properties. The assets we are conveying (i) shall include our assets in the Adena Field, the NECO Project, Weld County, East Crown and certain other oil and gas plugging, lease and other bonds. Subject to obtaining shareholder approval prior to the closing, we will also transfer to successor lender all of our right, title, and interest in and to all our Oakridge Energy, Inc. shares.\nIf this transaction closes, we will retain the Kansas-based assets, which currently generate a majority of our revenue and cash flow from operations, and the successor lender will agree that the conveyance of all of our other oil and gas assets, the Oakridge Energy shares, and the restated secured note in the principal amount of $4,500,000, payable with a discount at $3,300,000 provided the loan is paid in full prior to the maturity date November 1, 2017, subject to extension. We are seeking stockholder approval of that transaction at the annual meeting of its stockholders scheduled for April 27, 2017.\nDue to our indebtedness, liquidity issues and the potential for restructuring transactions, there is risk that, among other things:\n\u00b7 it may become more difficult to retain, attract or replace key employees;\n\u00b7 employees could be distracted from performance of their duties or attracted to other career opportunities; and\n\u00b7 our suppliers, hedge counterparties, vendors and service providers could renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThe occurrence of certain of these events has already negatively affected our business and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Closing is expected to occur on or before May 1, 2017.\nShould we not be able to close this transaction, our existing and future debt agreements could create issues as principal and interest payments become due and the debt matures that will threaten our ability to continue as a going concern. We will likely seek bankruptcy protection if this transaction is not approved by the stockholders.\nUntil we repay the full amount of our outstanding credit facility, we may continue to have substantial indebtedness, which is secured by substantially all of our assets.\nWhile our bank sold its rights under our credit facility to the successor lender, and the successor lender has agreed to a transaction in which we can contribute certain of our assets, our shares in Oakridge Energy, and reduce our loan amount from $17,925,000 to a restated note in the original principal amount of $4,500,000, subject to a $1,200,000 discount provided that we repay the successor lender $3,300,000 prior to the maturity date of November 1, 2017 (subject to extension). In exchange we can retain our Kansas oil and gas assets. Unless and until this transaction closes (which is dependent on the approval of our stockholders), we will remain in default on our obligations, and the successor lender may enforce its rights as secured parties and we will likely lose all of our Kansas assets and may be forced to liquidate the Company.\nWe are unable to fulfill our obligations under our credit facility which is adversely affecting our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of $17,925,000 under the credit facility and our borrowing base was $17,925,000. Our substantial indebtedness, and the related interest expense, could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 being forced to use cash flow to reduce our outstanding balance as a result of an unfavorable borrowing base redetermination;\n\u00b7 our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service our indebtedness;\n\u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have less leverage;\n\u00b7 our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and changes in government regulation;\n\u00b7 our ability to, or increasing the cost of, refinancing our indebtedness; and\n\u00b7 our ability to enter into marketing, hedging, optimization and trading transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.\nThe covenants in our Credit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.\nThe credit facility imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, among other things, to:\n\u00b7 incur additional indebtedness and provide additional guarantees;\n\u00b7 pay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u00b7 create or permit certain liens;\n\u00b7 use the proceeds from the sales of our oil and gas properties;\n\u00b7 use the proceeds from the unwinding of certain financial hedges;\n\u00b7 engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7 consolidate, merge, sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries.\nThe credit facility also contains various affirmative covenants with which we are required to comply. With the signing of the \u201cEleventh Amendment\u201d on November 13, 2015 certain covenants were waived until December 31, 2016. With these covenants waived, we were incompliance with the affirmative covenant provisions of the credit facility.\nWe are currently unable to comply with some or all of these covenants. If we do not obtain waivers from the successor lender, we would be unable to make additional borrowings under these facilities; our indebtedness under these agreements would remain in default and repayment of debt could be accelerated. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we will not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness in the future, we may be subject to additional covenants, which may be more restrictive than those to which we are currently subject.\nOur 2016 oil and gas reserve report shows a material decline in our estimated reserves, which will have adverse implications to our business.\nOur 2016 oil and gas reserve report shows a material decline in our estimated reserves. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. For example, estimates of quantities of proved reserves and their PV10 value are affected by changes in crude oil and gas prices, because estimates are based on prevailing prices at the time of their determination. Further, reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in any exact way, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another.\nThe reduction in our reserve estimates is likely to change the schedule of future production and development drilling that was contemplated in our 2015 reserve report. Reserve estimates are generally different, and often materially so, from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Furthermore, estimates of quantities of proved reserves and their PV10 value may be affected by changes in crude oil and gas prices because the Company\u2019s estimates are based on prevailing prices at the time of their determination.\nCurrent volatile market conditions and significant fluctuations in energy prices may continue indefinitely, negatively affecting our business prospects and viability.\nThe oil and gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Further declines in the price of oil and natural gas will have a material adverse effect on our planned operations and financial condition. Additionally, the amount of any royalty payment we receive from the production of oil and gas from our oil and gas interests will depend on numerous factors beyond our control.\nWe may continue to incur substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, which would adversely impact our earnings.\nWe review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting. Under the full cost method of accounting, the net book value of oil and gas properties, less deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated \u201cceiling.\u201d The ceiling limitation is (a) the present value of future net revenues computed by applying current prices of oil & gas reserves (with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements) to estimated future production of proved oil & gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented, less estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of 10 percent and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized less (d) income tax effects related to differences between book and tax basis of properties. Future cash outflows associated with settling accrued retirement obligations are excluded from the calculation. Estimated future cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an un-weighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.\nAny excess of the net book value of proved oil and gas properties, less related deferred income taxes, over the ceiling is charged to expense and reflected as additional DD&A in the statement of operations. The ceiling calculation is performed quarterly. For the year ended December 31, 2015 impairment charges of $48,930,087 were recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2016 impairment charges of $8,032,670 were recorded.\nOur stock price has declined below $1.00 per share. If the average closing price of our common stock is less than $1.00 per share for a period of over 30 consecutive trading days, the NYSE could delist our common stock.\nThe NYSE requires that the average closing price of a listed company\u2019s common stock not be less than $1.00 per share for a period of over 30 consecutive trading dates. Under NYSE rules, a company can avoid delisting, if, during the six month period following receipt of the NYSE notice and on the last trading day of any calendar month, a company\u2019s common stock price per share and 30 trading-day average share price is at least $1.00. During this six month period, a company\u2019s common stock will continue to be traded on the NYSE, subject to compliance with other continued listing requirements.\nIn the future, if our common stock ultimately were to be delisted for any reason, it could negatively impact us by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; (iii) limiting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradeable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets; and (iv) impairing our ability to provide equity incentives to our employees.\nRisks Associated with our Industry\nOil and gas prices are volatile. Future price volatility may negatively impact cash flows which could result in an inability to cover our operating and/or capital expenditures.\nOur future revenues, profitability, future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on the prices we realize for our oil and gas production. Our realized prices may also affect the amount of cash flow available for operating and/or capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital.\nOil and gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in or perceptions regarding supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Among the factors that can cause this volatility are:\n\u00b7 commodities speculators;\n\u00b7 local, national and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u00b7 worldwide or regional demand for energy, which is affected by economic conditions;\n\u00b7 the domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas;\n\u00b7 weather conditions;\n\u00b7 natural disasters;\n\u00b7 acts of terrorism and war;\n\u00b7 domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u00b7 political and economic conditions in oil and gas producing countries, including those in the Middle East and South America;\n\u00b7 impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil and gas prices;\n\u00b7 the availability of refining capacity;\n\u00b7 actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other state controlled oil and gas companies relating to oil and gas price and production controls; and\n\u00b7 the price and availability of other fuels.\nIt is impossible to predict oil and gas price movements with certainty. A drop in oil and gas prices may not only decrease our future revenues on a per unit basis but also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. A substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices would materially and adversely affect our future business enough to potentially force us to cease our business operations. In addition, our reserves, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to finance and execute planned capital expenditures will also suffer in such a price decline.\nDeclining economic conditions and worsening geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our business.\nOur operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. Markets in the United States and elsewhere have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 5 years, due in part to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system and the financial markets generally. The consequences of a potential or prolonged recession may include a lower level of economic activity, decreasing demand for petroleum products and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets.\nIn addition, actual and attempted terrorist attacks in the United States, Middle East, Southeast Asia and Europe, and war or armed hostilities in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, North Africa, Iran, North Korea or elsewhere, or the fear of such events, could further exacerbate the volatility and disruption to the financial markets and economies.\nWhile the ultimate outcome and impact of the current economic conditions cannot be predicted, a lower level of economic activity might result in a decline in energy consumption, which may materially adversely affect the price of oil and gas, our revenues, liquidity and future growth. Instability in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, also may affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves numerous uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nOur development, exploitation and exploration activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of a well does not ensure a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. In addition to their cost, unsuccessful wells can hurt our efforts to replace reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u00b7 unexpected operational events and/or conditions;\n\u00b7 reductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7 limitations in the market for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7 facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u00b7 title problems;\n\u00b7 oil and gas quality issues;\n\u00b7 pipe, casing, cement or pipeline failures;\n\u00b7 natural disasters;\n\u00b7 fires, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, pollution and other risks or accidents;\n\u00b7 environmental hazards, such as oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;\n\u00b7 compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u00b7 uncontrollable flows of oil or natural gas or well fluids.\nIf we experience any of these problems, it could affect well bores, gathering systems and processing facilities, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7 injury or loss of life;\n\u00b7 severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7 pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7 clean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7 regulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u00b7 suspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7 repairs to resume operations.\nBecause we use third-party drilling contractors to drill our wells, we may not realize the full benefit of worker compensation laws in dealing with their employees. Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance at levels that would provide enough funds for us to continue operating without access to other funds. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could impact our operations enough to force us to cease our operations.\nApproximately 45.5% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 consist of undeveloped reserves, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced.\nOur estimated total proved PV10 (present value) before tax of reserves as of December 31, 2016 was $3.4 million, versus $8.8 million as of December 31, 2015. Of the 1.6 million BOE of total proved reserves, approximately 12.2% are classified as proved developed producing, approximately 42.3% are classified as proved developed non-producing, and approximately 45.5% are classified as proved undeveloped.\nAssuming we can obtain adequate capital resources, we plan to develop and produce all of our proved reserves, but ultimately some of these reserves may not be developed or produced. Furthermore, not all of our undeveloped or developed non-producing reserves may be produced in the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have budgeted, or at all. For further information please see the disclosures in Footnote 14 to the Notes to the Financial Statements.\nBecause we face uncertainties in estimating proved recoverable reserves, you should not place undue reliance on such reserve information.\nOur reserve estimates and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves at December 31, 2016 were prepared by Cobb & Associates, Inc., an independent petroleum consultant. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and cash flows from such reserves, including factors beyond our control and the control of these independent consultants and engineers. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that can be economically extracted, which cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to these reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices, expenditures for future development and exploitation activities, and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserves and future cash flows may also be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history, development and exploitation activities and oil and gas prices. Actual future production, revenue, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, quantities of recoverable reserves and value of cash flows from those reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates in our reserve reports. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classification of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows. In addition, reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. The estimated quantities of proved reserves and the discounted present value of future net cash flows attributable to those reserves included in this report were prepared by Cobb & Associates, Inc. in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and are not intended to represent the fair market value of such reserves.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7 geological conditions;\n\u00b7 assumptions governing future oil and gas prices;\n\u00b7 amount and timing of actual production;\n\u00b7 availability of funds;\n\u00b7 future operating and development costs;\n\u00b7 actual prices we receive for oil and gas;\n\u00b7 changes in government regulations and taxation; and\n\u00b7 capital costs of drilling new wells\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of our properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general.\nThe differential between the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, or other benchmark price of oil and gas and the wellhead price we receive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe prices that we receive for our oil production in Texas, Colorado and Kansas are typically based on a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The prices we receive for our natural gas production in Colorado is based upon local market conditions but generally we receive a discount to Henry Hub. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and gas differentials. In recent years for example, production increases from competing North American producers, in conjunction with limited refining and pipeline capacity have widened this differential. Recent economic conditions, including volatility in the price of oil and gas, have resulted in both increases and decreases in the differential between the benchmark price for oil and gas and the wellhead price we receive. These fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows by decreasing the proceeds we receive for our oil and gas production in comparison to what we would receive if not for the differential.\nThe oil and gas business involves numerous uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nOur development, exploitation and exploration activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of an oil and gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. In addition to their cost, unsuccessful wells can hurt our efforts to replace reserves.\nThe oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u00b7 unexpected operational events and/or conditions;\n\u00b7 reductions in oil and gas prices;\n\u00b7 limitations in the market for oil and gas;\n\u00b7 adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7 facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u00b7 title problems;\n\u00b7 oil and gas quality issues;\n\u00b7 pipe, casing, cement or pipeline failures;\n\u00b7 natural disasters;\n\u00b7 fires, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, pollution and other risks or accidents;\n\u00b7 environmental hazards, such as oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;\n\u00b7 compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u00b7 uncontrollable flows of oil and gas or well fluids\nIf we experience any of these problems, it could affect well bores, gathering systems and processing facilities, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7 injury or loss of life;\n\u00b7 severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7 pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7 clean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7 regulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u00b7 suspension of our operations; and\n\u00b7 repairs to resume operations\nBecause we use third-party drilling contractors to drill our wells, we may not realize the full benefit of worker compensation laws in dealing with their employees. Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. We do not carry business interruption insurance at levels that would provide enough funds for us to continue operating without access to other funds. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could impact our operations enough to force us to cease our operations.\nDrilling wells is speculative, and any material inaccuracies in our forecasted drilling costs, estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect our business.\nDeveloping and exploring for oil and gas involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes definitive statements as to the time required and costs involved in reaching certain objectives. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise due to a tightening in the supply of various types of oil and gas field equipment and related services. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including geological conditions, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling of an oil and gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economic. Our initial drilling and development sites, and any potential additional sites that may be developed, require significant additional exploration and development, regulatory approval and commitments of resources prior to commercial development. If our actual drilling and development costs are significantly more than our estimated costs, we may not be able to continue our business operations as proposed and would be forced to modify our plan of operation.\nDevelopment of our reserves, when established, may not occur as scheduled and the actual results may not be as anticipated. Drilling activity and lack of access to economically acceptable capital may result in downward adjustments in reserves or higher than anticipated costs. Our estimates will be based on various assumptions, including assumptions over which we have control and assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. We have control over our operations that affect, among other things, acquisitions and dispositions of properties, availability of funds, use of applicable technologies, hydrocarbon recovery efficiency, drainage volume and production decline rates that are part of these estimates and assumptions and any variance in our operations that affects these items within our control may have a material effect on reserves. The process of estimating our oil and gas reserves is extremely complex, and requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Our estimates may not be reliable enough to allow us to be successful in our intended business operations. Our actual production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures and operating expenses will likely vary from those anticipated. These variances may be material. In 2015 we had a carried interest in the drilling of two exploratory wells and we drilled no developmental wells.\nUnless we replace our oil and gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flows and income.\nUnless we conduct successful development, exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and gas production, and, therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are:\n\u00b7 unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them;\n\u00b7 unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or\n\u00b7 outbid by competitors.\nIf we are unable to develop, exploit, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production, our cash flow and income will decline as production declines, until our existing properties would be incapable of sustaining commercial production.\nIn order to exploit successfully our current oil and gas leases and others that we acquire in the future, we will need to generate significant amounts of capital.\nThe oil and gas exploration, development and production business is a capital-intensive undertaking. In order for us to be successful in acquiring, investigating, developing, and producing oil and gas from our current mineral leases and other leases that we may acquire in the future, we will need to generate an amount of capital in excess of that generated from our results of operations. In order to generate that additional capital, we may need to obtain an expanded debt facility and issue additional shares of our equity securities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in either obtaining that expanded debt facility or issuing additional shares of our equity securities, and our inability to generate the needed additional capital may have a material adverse effect on our prospects and financial results of operations. If we are able to issue additional equity securities in order to generate such additional capital, then those issuances may occur at prices that represent discounts to our trading price, and will dilute the percentage ownership interest of those persons holding our shares prior to such issuances. Unless we are able to generate additional enterprise value with the proceeds of the sale of our equity securities, those issuances may adversely affect the value of our shares that are outstanding prior to those issuances.\nA significant portion of our potential future reserves and our business plan depend upon secondary recovery techniques to establish production. There are significant risks associated with such techniques.\nWe anticipate that a significant portion of our future reserves and our business plan will be associated with secondary recovery projects that are either in the early stage of implementation or are scheduled for implementation subject to availability of capital. We anticipate that secondary recovery will affect our reserves and our business plan, and the exact project initiation dates and, by the very nature of water flood operations, the exact completion dates of such projects are uncertain. In addition, the reserves and our business plan associated with these secondary recovery projects, as with any reserves, are estimates only, as the success of any development project, including these water flood projects, cannot be ascertained in advance. If we are not successful in developing a significant portion of our reserves associated with secondary recovery methods, then the project may be uneconomic or generate less cash flow and reserves than we had estimated prior to investing the capital. Risks associated with secondary recovery techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 higher than projected operating costs;\n\u00b7 lower-than-expected production;\n\u00b7 longer response times;\n\u00b7 higher costs associated with obtaining capital;\n\u00b7 unusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in oil and gas prices;\n\u00b7 regulatory changes;\n\u00b7 shortages of equipment; and\n\u00b7 lack of technical expertise.\nIf any of these risks occur, it could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nAny acquisitions we complete are subject to considerable risk.\nEven if we make acquisitions that we believe are good for our business, all acquisitions involve potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u00b7 the validity of our assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u00b7 an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;\n\u00b7 a decrease in our liquidity by using our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7 a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7 the assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u00b7 the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7 an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage the acquired properties or assets;\n\u00b7 the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges;\n\u00b7 unforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic or geological areas; and\n\u00b7 customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nOur decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often incomplete or inconclusive.\nOur reviews of acquired properties can be inherently incomplete because it is not always feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as ground water contamination, plugging or orphaned well liability are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nWe must obtain governmental permits and approvals for drilling operations, which can result in delays in our operations, be a costly and time consuming process, and result in restrictions on our operations.\nRegulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuances in the regions in which we operate. Compliance with the requirements imposed by these authorities can be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of our exploration or production operations and/or fines. Regulatory or legal actions in the future may materially interfere with our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we are often required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that a proposed project may have on the environment, threatened and endangered species, and cultural and archaeological artifacts. Accordingly, the permits we need may not be issued, or if issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably.\nDue to our lack of geographic diversification, adverse developments in our operating areas would materially affect our business.\nWe currently only lease and operate oil and gas properties located in Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and Texas. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from these properties caused by significant governmental regulation, transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions or other events which impact this area.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for all, or a substantial amount of our sales. If these customers reduce the volumes of oil and gas they purchase from us, our revenue and cash flow will decline to the extent we are not able to find new customers for our production.\nIn Kansas, we sell oil to Coffeyville Resources. There are approximately six potential purchasers of oil in Kansas. If a key purchaser were to reduce the volume of oil it purchases from us, our revenue and cash available for operations will decline to the extent we are not able to find new customers to purchase our production at equivalent prices.\nWe currently sell oil to Sunoco Logistics, Inc. in Texas. There are numerous purchasers in Texas, but increased production volumes from extensive shale drilling activity in the area could result in reduced purchases by several of our purchasers.\nIn Colorado we sell oil to ARM Energy Management LLC. There are a number of potential purchasers of our oil in Colorado but increased production volumes from the DJ basin could result in reduced purchases by our purchasers. If a key purchaser were to reduce the volume of oil it purchases from us, our revenue and cash available for operations will decline to the extent we are not able to find new customers to purchase our production at equivalent prices.\nWe sell natural gas to United Energy Trading and Western Operating Company in Colorado. There are other purchasers for our natural gas in Colorado. If a key purchaser were to reduce the volume of gas it purchases from us, our revenue and cash available for operations will decline to the extent we are not able to find new customers to purchase our production at equivalent prices.\nWe are not the operator of some of our properties and we have limited control over the activities on those properties.\nWe are not the operator of our Mississippian Project, and our dependence on the operator of this project limits our ability to influence or control the operation or future development of this project. Such limitations could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital related to exploration, drilling or production activities and lead to unexpected future costs.\nWe may suffer losses or incur liability for events for which we or the operator of a property have chosen not to obtain insurance.\nOur operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in producing and transporting oil and gas, such as fires, natural disasters, explosions, pipeline ruptures, spills, and acts of terrorism, all of which can result in the loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution, personal injury claims and other damage to our and others\u2019 properties. As protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. As a result of market conditions, existing insurance policies may not be renewed and other desirable insurance may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The occurrence of an event that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on processing facilities owned by others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with our ability to market our oil and gas production and could harm our business.\nThe marketability of our oil and gas production will depend in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and oil and gas processing facilities. The amount of oil and gas that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage or lack of available capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we will be provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in pipeline capacity or the capacity of processing facilities could significantly reduce our ability to market our oil and gas production and could materially harm our business.\nCost and availability of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and other services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our development, exploitation and exploration plans.\nShortages or an increase in cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel could delay or interrupt our operations, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Drilling activity in the geographic areas in which we conduct drilling activities may increase, which would lead to increases in associated costs, including those related to drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry. Increased drilling activity in these areas may also decrease the availability of rigs. We do not have any contracts for drilling rigs and drilling rigs may not be readily available when we need them. Drilling and other costs may increase further and necessary equipment and services may not be available to us at economical prices.\nOur exposure to possible leasehold defects and potential title failure could materially adversely impact our ability to conduct drilling operations.\nWe obtain the right and access to properties for drilling by obtaining oil and gas leases either directly from the hydrocarbon owner, or through a third party that owns the lease. The leases may be taken or assigned to us without title insurance. There is a risk of title failure with respect to such leases, and such title failures could materially adversely impact our business by causing us to be unable to access properties to conduct drilling operations.\nOur reserves are subject to the risk of depletion because many of our leases are in mature fields that have produced large quantities of oil and gas to date.\nA significant portion of our operations are located in or near established fields in Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and Texas. As a result, many of our leases are in, or directly offset, areas that have produced large quantities of oil and gas to date. As such, our reserves may be negatively impacted by offsetting wells or previously drilled wells, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur lease ownership may be diluted due to financing strategies we may employ in the future.\nTo accelerate our development efforts we may take on working interest partners who will contribute to the costs of drilling and completion operations and then share in any cash flow derived from production. In addition, we may in the future, due to a lack of capital or other strategic reasons, establish joint venture partnerships or farm out all or part of our development efforts. These economic strategies may have a dilutive effect on our lease ownership and could significantly reduce our operating revenues.\nWe may face lease expirations on leases that are not currently held-by-production.\nWe have numerous leases that are not currently held-by-production, some of which have near term lease expirations and are likely to expire. Although we believe that we can maintain our most desirable leases by conducting drilling operations or by negotiating lease extensions, we can make no guarantee that we can maintain these leases.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nDevelopment, production and sale of oil and gas in the United States are subject to extensive laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 location and density of wells;\n\u00b7 the handling of drilling fluids and obtaining discharge permits for drilling operations;\n\u00b7 accounting for and payment of royalties on production from state, federal and Indian lands;\n\u00b7 bonds for ownership, development and production of oil and gas properties;\n\u00b7 transportation of oil and gas by pipelines;\n\u00b7 operation of wells and reports concerning operations; and\n\u00b7 taxation.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, oil and gas spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Accordingly, any of these liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations enough to possibly force us to cease our business operations.\nOur operations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental, operational safety and other matters.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and safety requirements applicable to our oil and gas production activities. We may also be exposed to the risk of costs associated with Kansas Corporation Commission, the Texas Railroad Commission and the State of Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission requirements to plug orphaned and abandoned wells on our oil and gas leases from wells previously drilled by third parties. In addition, we may indemnify sellers or lessors of oil and gas properties for environmental liabilities they or their predecessors may have created. These costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, including regulations and enforcement policies, which have tended to become increasingly strict over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs, liens and to a lesser extent, issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our operations.\nStrict, joint and several liability may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. New laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. If we are not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, our ability to operate effectively could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and our competitors may have greater resources than do we.\nThe oil and gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies, many of which are larger and have greater financial, technological, human and other resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce crude oil and gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Such companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, such companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and gas market prices. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. If we are unable to compete, our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with our Stock\nWe have ceased paying dividends on our Series A preferred stock, causing the trading price of the preferred stock to dramatically decline\nOn November 4, 2015, we announced that we would not be declaring the monthly dividend for the month of November 2015 on our 10.00% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock in order to preserve our cash resources. We have not declared the monthly dividend since, and do not expect to do so in the near future. The failure to declare and pay monthly dividends on our preferred stock caused its trading price to decline substantially.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends to holders of our common stock because of the terms of our debt facility, and our need to reinvest cash flow from operations in our business.\nIt is unlikely that we will pay any dividends to the holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The terms of our debt facility require that the lender approve any such distributions, and the lender is unlikely to provide that consent so long as we have significant unpaid indebtedness outstanding.\nOwnership of our common stock is highly concentrated, and such concentration may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur directors, officers and principal stockholders (stockholders owning 10% or more of our common stock) and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 3,973,168 shares or 47.17% of the outstanding shares of common stock, stock options, and derivatives that could have been converted to common stock at December 31, 2016, and as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such stockholders will have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and other corporate actions.\nTwo of our Directors, Ryan A. Lowe and Lance W. Helfert, served on the investment committee of West Coast Asset Management, Inc. West Coast Asset Management was the managing member of West Coast Opportunity Fund, LLC, a private investment vehicle formed for the purpose of investing in a wide variety of securities and financial instruments. West Coast Opportunity Fund, LLC was terminated in July 2015 and all of the assets of the fund, including EnerJex common and preferred shares were distributed to the shareholders of that fund. West Coast Asset Management\u2019s principals also manage Montecito Venture Partners, LLC. Montecito Venture Partners, LLC beneficially owned 1.53% of our common stock and .7% of our Series A preferred stock at December 31, 2016 and as of the date of this filing. West Coast Asset Management, Inc. was dissolved in September 2016.\nIn addition, we engage from time to time in transactions with certain of these significant stockholders.\nAs stated above, Montecito Venture Partners affiliates of our directors Mr. Lowe and Mr. Helfert, beneficially own, as of December 31, 2016, 1.53% of our common stock and .7% of our Series A preferred stock. The interests of Montecito Venture Partners, and their affiliates, may differ from those of our other stockholders. Montecito Venture Partners, and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and maximizing the return on those investments. They currently have, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain aspects of our business or our suppliers\u2019 or customers\u2019 businesses.\nWe have derivative securities currently outstanding and we may issue derivative securities in the future. Exercise of the derivatives will cause dilution to existing and new stockholders.\nThe exercise of our outstanding options and warrants, will cause additional shares of common stock to be issued, resulting in dilution to our existing and future common stockholders\nWe have the ability to issue additional shares of our common stock and preferred stock without asking for stockholder approval, which could cause your investment to be diluted.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize the board of directors to issue up to 250,000,000 shares of common stock and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The power of the board of directors to issue shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock is generally not subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, any additional issuance of our common stock, or preferred stock that may be convertible into common stock, or debt instruments that may be convertible into common or preferred stock, may have the effect of diluting one\u2019s investment.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT and our Series A preferred stock is traded on the OTC PINK, daily trading volumes are small making it difficult for investors to sell their shares.\nOur common stock and our Series A preferred stock trade under the symbol \u201cENRJ,\u201d and \u201cENRJP,\u201d respectively but trading volume has been minimal. Therefore, the market for our common stock is limited. The trading price of our stock could be subject to wide fluctuations. Investors may not be able to purchase additional shares or sell their shares within the time frame or at a price they desire.\nThe price of our common stock and Series A preferred stock may be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at a favorable price.\nRegardless of whether an active trading market for our stock develops, the market price of our stock may be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for such shares. Many factors beyond our control, including but not limited to the following factors could affect our stock price:\n\u00b7 our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income or loss per share, net income or loss and revenues;\n\u00b7 changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts about us or the exploration and production industry;\n\u00b7 potentially limited liquidity;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our reserve estimates and quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in oil and gas prices;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by significant stockholders and future issuances of our common stock;\n\u00b7 increases in our cost of capital;\n\u00b7 changes in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings and enforcement and legal actions;\n\u00b7 commencement of or involvement in litigation;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u00b7 general market conditions, including fluctuations in and the occurrence of events or trends affecting the price of oil and gas; and\n\u00b7 domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation, restated bylaws and Nevada Law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of us.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock and common stock without stockholder approval. The election by our board of directors to issue Series A preferred stock, and any future election to issue more preferred stock, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. In addition, provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. In addition, Nevada\u2019s \u201cCombination with Interested Stockholders\u2019 Statute\u201d and its \u201cControl Share Acquisition Statute\u201d may have the effect in the future of delaying or making it more difficult to effect a change in control of us.\nThese statutory anti-takeover measures may have certain negative consequences, including an effect on the ability of our stockholders or other individuals to (i) change the composition of the incumbent board of directors; (ii) benefit from certain transactions which are opposed by the incumbent board of directors; and (iii) make a tender offer or attempt to gain control of us, even if such attempt were beneficial to us and our stockholders. Since such measures may also discourage the accumulations of large blocks of our common stock by purchasers whose objective is to seek control of us or have such common stock repurchased by us or other persons at a premium, these measures could also depress the market price of our common stock. Accordingly, our stockholders may be deprived of certain opportunities to realize the \u201ccontrol premium\u201d associated with take-over attempts.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. You may not receive funds without selling your stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Our future dividend policy with regard to our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, investment opportunities and restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments, including the consent of debt holders and holders of Series A Shares, if applicable at such time, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nAdditional Risks and Uncertainties\nWe are an oil and gas acquisition, exploration and development company. If any of the risks that we face actually occur, irrespective of whether those risks are described in this section or elsewhere in this report, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 14720, "SIC": 3721, "TIC": "UAVS"}
