{"cik": "1282543", "company": "AFFIRMATIVE INSURANCE HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThere is Substantial Doubt About the Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. This assumes continuing operations and the realization of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe Company incurred losses from operations over the last six years, including an operating loss of $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Losses over this period were primarily due to underwriting losses, significant revenue declines, expenses declining less than the amount of revenue declines, and goodwill impairments. The losses from operations were the result of significant new business written in 2012 and 2013, prior pricing issues in some states in which the Company has taken significant pricing and underwriting actions to address profitability, losses from states that the Company has exited, such as Florida and Michigan, and goodwill impairment charges as a result of such losses.\nThe senior secured and subordinated credit facilities contain quarterly debt covenants that set forth, among other things, minimum risk-based capital requirements for the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries as well as minimum cash flow requirements for the Company\u2019s non-regulated businesses. The credit facilities have been amended to waive compliance with the risk-based capital measurement requirement as of December 31, 2014 and as of March 31, 2015, and to postpone the principal payment of $3.5 million due March 31, 2015 to June 30, 2015. Except for the minimum risk-based capital requirement for which the Company obtained a waiver, the Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2014. However, it is probable the Company will not meet certain of these covenants in future periods. If the Company is unable to achieve compliance with the covenants or obtain a forbearance or waiver of any non-compliance or amend the agreements to change such covenants, the lenders could declare all amounts outstanding under the facilities to be immediately due and payable. Even if the Company is compliant with the covenants or, if not compliant, obtains additional forbearance or waivers from its lenders, there is still substantial uncertainty that the Company will be able to refinance or extend the maturity of the senior secured facility when it becomes due in March 2016. If the Company\u2019s lenders declare the amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable or if the Company is unable to refinance or extend the maturity of the senior secured credit facility when it becomes due, it would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and the Company\u2019s creditors and stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws, including the laws of their state of domicile. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, require insurance companies to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. At December 31, 2014, the risk-based capital level of Affirmative Insurance Company (AIC) triggered a regulatory action level event under the NAIC standard. As a result, AIC is required to submit a plan to the Illinois Department of Insurance (IDOI) in April 2015 detailing corrective actions it will take to return its risk-based capital ratio to an acceptable level. Upon receipt of the plan, the IDOI may accept the plan, require further amendments to the plan or take additional regulatory action including, but not limited to, placing AIC in receivership. Such additional regulatory action by the Illinois Department of Insurance would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and the interest of its creditors and stockholders. Such additional regulatory action by the Illinois Department of Insurance also would trigger a further event of default under the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facility and subordinated credit facility allowing the Company\u2019s lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the facilities to be immediately due and payable, and if such amounts were declared immediately due and payable by the lenders, it would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and the interests of its creditors and stockholders.\nThe Company has taken and will continue to pursue appropriate actions to improve the underwriting results. The Company is also pursuing various other actions to address these issues. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be effective.\nThe Company\u2019s recent history of recurring losses from operations, its failure to comply with certain financial covenants in its senior secured and subordinated credit facilities, its need to meet debt repayment requirements and its failure to comply with the Illinois Department of Insurance minimum risk-based capital requirements raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of this uncertainty on the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities.\nDisruptions in the overall economy and the financial markets may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe insurance industry can be affected by many macroeconomic factors, including changes in national, regional, and local economic conditions, employment levels and consumer spending patterns. Disruptions in the overall economy and financial markets could reduce consumer confidence in the economy and adversely affect consumers\u2019 ability to purchase automobile insurance policies from us, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations, adversely affect our ability to comply with our covenants under our credit facilities. Such declines may also, in addition to negatively impacting our operating results, adversely\nimpact our overall financial condition, liquidity, credit rating, ability to access capital markets, and ability to retain and attract key employees. There can be no assurances that government responses to the recent disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit.\nOur largest stockholder controls a significant percentage of our common stock and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nNew Affirmative LLC (New Affirmative) beneficially owns 48.7% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, New Affirmative exercises significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of New Affirmative with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. New Affirmative\u2019s continued concentrated ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.\nThe market for trading our common stock may become unstable or cease to exist, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock.\nIn 2012, our common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Our common stock is now traded exclusively in the over-the-counter market. We cannot predict the actions of market makers, investors or other market participants, and can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will remain stable. If there is no active trading market in our common stock, the market price and liquidity of our common stock will be adversely affected.\nFuture issuances or sales of our common stock, including under our equity incentive plan or in connection with future acquisition activities, may adversely affect our common stock price.\nAs of the date of this filing, we had an aggregate of 56,050,780 shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes. In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We have reserved 3,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance under our equity incentive plan, of which 1,904,806 shares are issuable upon vesting and exercise of options granted as of the date of this filing, including exercisable options of 1,250,000 as of the date of this filing. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions of competitors and related businesses and may issue shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions. Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and any sale or issuance of our common stock will dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders.\nNew Affirmative, our largest stockholder, beneficially owns 48.7% of our common stock. New Affirmative has certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of our common stock it beneficially owns. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock by our largest stockholder, New Affirmative, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nBecause of our significant concentration in non-standard personal automobile insurance and in a limited number of states, our profitability may be adversely affected by negative developments and cyclical changes in the industry or negative developments in these states.\nSubstantially all of our gross written premiums and our commission income and fees are generated from sales of non-standard personal automobile insurance policies. As a result of our concentration in this line of business, negative developments in the business, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the non-standard personal automobile insurance industry could have a negative effect on our profitability and would have a more pronounced effect on us as compared to more diversified companies. Examples of such negative developments would be increasing trends in automobile repair costs, automobile parts costs, used car prices and medical care expenses, increased regulation, as well as increased litigation of claims and higher levels of fraudulent claims. All of these events can result in reduced profitability.\nIn addition, the non-standard personal automobile insurance industry historically has been cyclical in nature, characterized by periods of severe price competition and excess underwriting capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. These fluctuations in the non-standard personal automobile insurance business cycle may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by conditions in the states where our business is concentrated.\nOur business is concentrated in a limited number of states. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 34.6% of our gross written premiums managed related to policies issued to customers in Louisiana, 28.7% to customers in Texas, 22.9% to customers in California and 6.9% to customers in Alabama. Our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in these states. Changes in any of these conditions could make it less attractive for us to do business in these states and could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIntense competition could adversely affect our profitability.\nThe non-standard personal automobile insurance business is highly competitive and, except for regulatory considerations, there are relatively few barriers to entry. Our insurance companies compete with other insurance companies that sell non-standard personal automobile insurance policies through independent agencies as well as with insurance companies that sell such policies directly to their customers. The independent agencies that sell our insurance products compete both with these direct writers and with other independent agencies. Therefore, our competitors are not only large national insurance companies, but also smaller regional insurance companies and independent agencies. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer a broader range of products or competing products at lower prices. In addition, existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates and new competitors may enter this market, particularly larger insurance companies that do not presently write non-standard personal automobile insurance. In this environment, we may experience a reduction in our underwriting margins or sales of our insurance policies may decrease as individuals purchase lower-priced products from other insurance companies. A loss of business to competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages could negatively affect our revenues and net income.\nOur success depends on our ability to price accurately the risks we underwrite.\nThe results of our operations and the financial condition of our insurance companies depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully, and as a result, price our products accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data;\n\u00b7\nthe uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;\n\u00b7\nour selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated changes in legal standards, claim settlement practices, medical care expenses and automobile repair costs.\nConsequently, we could under-price risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness. In either event, the profitability of our insurance companies could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses exceed our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, we will incur additional charges to earnings.\nWe maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability for losses and the related loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims on insurance policies issued by our insurance companies. The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, involving actuarial and statistical projections of what we expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims based on historical claims information, estimates of future trends in claims severity in multiple markets and other variable factors such as inflation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves, it has been necessary, and will continue to be necessary, to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in our reserves for claims and related expenses.\nWe cannot be sure that our ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will not materially exceed our reserves. To the extent that our reserves prove to be inadequate in the future, we would be required to increase our reserves for losses and the related loss adjustment expenses and incur a charge to earnings in the subsequent period during which such reserves are increased, which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the subsequent period. In addition, we have a limited history in establishing reserves in certain states, and our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses may not necessarily accurately predict future trends in our models to assess these amounts.\nWe may not be successful in reducing our risk and increasing our underwriting capacity through reinsurance arrangements, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use quota-share reinsurance primarily to increase our underwriting capacity and to reduce our exposure to losses. Quota-share reinsurance is a form of pro rata reinsurance arrangement in which the reinsurer participates in a specified percentage of the premiums and losses on every risk that comes within the scope of the reinsurance agreement in return for a portion of the corresponding premiums. The availability, cost and structure of reinsurance protection is subject to changing market conditions that are outside of our control. In order for these contracts to qualify for reinsurance accounting and thereby provide the additional underwriting capacity that we might need, the reinsurer generally must assume significant risk and have a reasonable possibility of a significant loss. Reinsurance may not be continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates that are currently available.\nAlthough the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent we transfer, or \u201ccede,\u201d risk to the reinsurer, we remain ultimately liable to the policyholder on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not limit our ultimate obligations to policyholders to pay claims. We are subject to credit risks with respect to the financial strength of our reinsurers. The reinsurers for our quota-share and excess of loss reinsurance agreements all have A- or better ratings from A.M. Best. When appropriate, we obtain irrevocable letters of credit or require the reinsurer to establish trust funds to secure their obligations to us. Accordingly, we believe there is minimal credit risk related to these reinsurance receivables.\nThe Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) is the mandatory reinsurance facility that covers no-fault medical losses above a specific retention amount in Michigan. We cede losses to the MCCA associated with the run-off of our Michigan business.\nWe are also subject to the risk that our reinsurers may dispute their obligations to pay our claims. As a result, we may not recover claims made to our reinsurers in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, if insurance departments deem that under our existing or future reinsurance contracts the reinsurer does not assume significant risk and does not have a reasonable possibility of significant loss, we may not be able to increase our ability to write business based on this reinsurance. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant losses if any of our reinsurers do not pay our claims in a timely manner.\nAlthough our reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we transfer risk to the reinsurers, we remain ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks reinsured. Consequently, if any of our reinsurers cannot pay their reinsurance obligations, or dispute these obligations, we remain liable to pay the claims of our policyholders. In addition, our reinsurance agreements are subject to specified contractual limits on the amounts and types of losses covered, and we do not have reinsurance coverage to the extent our losses exceed those limits or are not of the type reinsured. If any of our reinsurers are unable or unwilling to pay amounts they owe us in a timely fashion, we could suffer a significant loss, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had a $9.3 million net recoverable from Vesta Fire Insurance Corporation (VFIC). We have, with the approval of the VFIC Special Deputy Receiver and the District Court, Austin, Texas, withdrawn $9.0 million from the trust securing our reinsurance recoverables from VFIC, which represented 100% of the amount we paid in losses as of the date of the withdrawal covered by the VFIC reinsurance. In March 2015, we received a notice of determination from the VFIC Special Deputy Receiver on multiple proofs of claim for an aggregate amount of $15.3 million for various reinsurance balances with VFIC. As part of the notice of determination, we entered into a settlement agreement and release with the VFIC Special Deputy Receiver. We expect to receive the $15.3 million in settlement proceeds by May 2015.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation that may restrict our ability to earn profits.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as in the states where our subsidiaries sell insurance products, issue policies and handle claims. Certain states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of certain corporate actions, which may adversely affect our ability to operate, innovate, obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow our business profitably. These regulations provide safeguards for policy owners and are not intended to protect the interests of stockholders. Our ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable expense and to obtain necessary regulatory actions or approvals in a timely manner is and will continue to be critical to our success.\n\u00b7\nRequired licensing. We operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license, our ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market might be substantially impaired.\n\u00b7\nTransactions between insurance companies and their affiliates. Transactions between our insurance companies and their affiliates generally must be disclosed to state regulators, and prior approval of the applicable regulator generally is required\nbefore any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated. State regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of such a transaction, which may impact our ability to innovate or operate efficiently.\n\u00b7\nRestrictions on cancellation, non-renewal or withdrawal. Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurance company\u2019s ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurance company\u2019s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurance company from withdrawing from one or more lines of business in the state, except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance department. In some states, this applies to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written, not just to a complete withdrawal. These laws and regulations could limit our ability to exit or reduce our writings in unprofitable markets or discontinue unprofitable products in the future.\n\u00b7\nFederal Insurance Office. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) created within the United States Department of the Treasury a new Federal Insurance Office (FIO), whose purpose is (in part) to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk. If the FIO were to recommend to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (also created by the Dodd-Frank Act) that we are systemically significant and therefore require additional regulation, or that the insurance industry as a whole should be regulated at the federal level, our businesses could be affected significantly. We are unable to predict whether any additional federal laws or regulations will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses.\n\u00b7\nOther regulations. We must also comply with state and federal regulations involving, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe use of non-public consumer information and related privacy issues;\n\u00b7\nthe use of credit history in underwriting and rating;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\u00b7\nlaws and regulations governing the financing of premium for policies sold by us;\n\u00b7\nthe payment of dividends;\n\u00b7\nthe acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company;\n\u00b7\ninvoluntary assignments of high-risk policies, participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations, assessments and other governmental charges;\n\u00b7\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u00b7\nSEC reporting;\n\u00b7\nreporting with respect to financial condition; and\n\u00b7\nperiodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners.\nCompliance with laws and regulations addressing these and other issues often will result in increased administrative costs. In addition, these laws and regulations may limit our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent us from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs and may restrict our ability to discontinue unprofitable relationships or exit unprofitable markets. These results, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability to grow our business in certain jurisdictions. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in actions by regulators, fines and penalties, and in extreme cases, revocation of our ability to do business in that jurisdiction. In addition, we may face individual and class action lawsuits by our insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations.\nRegulation may become more extensive in the future, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot assure that states will not make existing insurance-related laws and regulations more restrictive in the future or enact new restrictive laws. New or more restrictive regulation in any state in which we conduct business could make it more expensive for us to conduct our business, restrict the premiums we are able to charge or otherwise change the way we do business. In such events, we may seek to reduce our writings in, or to withdraw entirely from these states. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies, including the recently created Federal Insurance Office, investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. We are unable to predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect our business will be adopted in the future, the timing of any such adoption and what effects, if any, they may have on our operations, profitability and financial condition.\nNew pricing, claims, coverage and financing issues and class action litigation are continually emerging in the automobile insurance industry, and these issues could adversely impact our revenues or our methods of doing business.\nAs automobile insurance industry practices and regulatory, judicial and consumer conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims, coverages, business practices and premium financing plans may emerge. These issues can have an\nadverse effect on our business by changing the way we price our products, by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent, or by increasing the size of claims. Examples of such issues include:\n\u00b7\nconcerns over the use of an applicant\u2019s credit score and zip code as a factor in making risk selections and pricing decisions;\n\u00b7\nplaintiffs seeking to void policy exclusions and other provisions providing the basis to limit or deny coverage in purported class action litigation;\n\u00b7\nplaintiffs targeting automobile insurers in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling practices, such as the permitted use of aftermarket (non-original equipment manufacturer) parts, total loss evaluation methodology and the alleged diminution in value to insureds\u2019 vehicles involved in accidents;\n\u00b7\nplaintiffs targeting insurers, including automobile insurers, in purported class action litigation which seek to recharacterize installment fees and other allowed charges related to insurers\u2019 installment billing programs as interest that violates state usury laws or other interest rate restrictions; and\n\u00b7\nconcerns regarding consumer data privacy.\nThe effects and costs of these and other unforeseen issues could negatively affect our revenues, income or our methods of business.\nOur insurance companies are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nOur insurance companies are subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws, including the laws of their state of domicile. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, require our insurance companies to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company\u2019s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital and trend test. Authorized control level risk-based capital is the number determined by applying the NAIC\u2019s risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations.\nFailure to meet applicable risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation. Additionally, certain contractual agreements to which we are a party, including our senior and subordinated credit facility agreements, require us to achieve or maintain certain risk-based capital ratios. Failure to achieve or maintain such risk-based capital ratios may result in a default or breach or prevent us from obtaining certain benefits under such agreements. Any changes in existing risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase our statutory capital levels. At December 31, 2014, three of our insurance subsidiaries maintained a risk-based capital level that was in excess of an amount that would require any corrective actions. The risk-based capital level of Affirmative Insurance Company (AIC) triggered a regulatory action level event under the NAIC standard. As a result, AIC is required to submit a plan to the Illinois Department of Insurance (IDOI) in April 2015 detailing corrective actions it will take to return its risk-based capital ratio to an acceptable level. Upon receipt of the plan, the IDOI may accept the plan, require further amendments to the plan or take additional regulatory action including, but not limited to, placing AIC in receivership.\nOur failure to maintain financial strength requirements as set forth by various state departments of insurance could adversely affect our business and overall liquidity.\nVarious individual state departments of insurance in jurisdictions where our insurance company subsidiaries conduct business maintain specific requirements in connection with the financial strength of property and casualty insurance companies. Failure on the part of our insurance company subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could subject us to an examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation.\nOur failure to pay claims accurately could adversely affect our business, financial results and capital requirements.\nWe must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, the culture of our claims organization and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to pay claims accurately could lead to material litigation or regulatory scrutiny, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image, as a result, and negatively affect our financial results.\nIn addition, if we do not train new claims employees effectively or if we lose a significant number of experienced claims employees, our claims department\u2019s ability to handle an increasing workload as we grow could be adversely affected. In addition to\npotentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, we could suffer decreased quality of claims work, which in turn could lower our operating margins.\nIf we are unable to retain and recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be hindered.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, growth and profitability. We maintain key person insurance for our chief executive officer.\nOur underwriting operations are vulnerable to a reduction in the amount of business written by independent agencies.\nOn September 30, 2013, we sold our affiliated retail agency distribution business to a third-party, which is now our largest independent agency relationship. A significant amount of our gross written premiums are produced by independent agencies. Consequently, our business depends in part on the marketing efforts of independent agencies and on our ability to offer insurance products and services that meet the requirements of these independent agencies and their customers. Independent agencies are not obligated to sell or promote our products, and since many of our competitors rely significantly on the independent agency market, we must compete with other insurance companies and underwriting agencies for independent agencies\u2019 business. Some of our competitors offer a larger variety of products, lower prices for insurance coverage or higher commissions, and we therefore may not be able to continue to attract and retain independent agencies to sell our insurance products. A material reduction in the amount of business our independent agencies sell would negatively impact our revenues.\nWe face litigation, which if decided adversely to us, could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are a party in a number of lawsuits. These lawsuits are described more fully elsewhere in this report. Litigation, by its very nature, is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain. The precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuits is uncertain and may, if these lawsuits are determined adversely to us, negatively impact our earnings.\nIn addition, potential litigation involving new claim, coverage and business practice issues could adversely affect our business by changing the way we price our products, extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increasing the size of claims. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claims, coverage and business practice issues could negatively impact our profitability or our methods of doing business.\nAdverse securities market conditions can have a significant and negative impact on our investment portfolio.\nOur results of operations depend in part on the performance of our invested assets. As of December 31, 2014, our investment portfolio was primarily invested in fixed-income securities. Certain risks are inherent in connection with fixed maturity securities including loss upon default and price volatility in reaction to changes in interest rates and general market factors. In general, the fair value of a portfolio of fixed-income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in the market interest rates, while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed-income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates. In addition, some of our fixed-income securities have call or prepayment options. This could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall and issuers call their securities. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates, so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time. Furthermore, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates. If market interest rates were to change 1.0% (for example, the difference between 5.0% and 6.0%), the fair value of our fixed-income securities would change approximately $0.8 million. The change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments.\nIf we are unable to make required payments or refinance our debt as it matures, it could have an adverse impact on our business and overall liquidity.\nIn 2013, we entered into a $40.0 million senior secured credit facility (senior facility) and a $10.0 million subordinated secured credit facility (subordinated facility). The senior facility matures on March 30, 2016, and the subordinated facility matures on March 30, 2017. The principal amount of the senior facility is payable in quarterly installments, and we are also required to make certain annual principal payments calculated based on our financial performance. Additionally, certain events, such as receipt of contingent proceeds from the sale of our retail business, the sale of other material assets, or the issuance of new equity, may necessitate additional required principal payments. After we have discharged all obligations under the senior facility, we will incur similar required payment obligations under the subordinated facility. We made $6.5 million and $5.0 million in principal payments under our senior facility during 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nOur obligations under the senior facility and subordinated facility are guaranteed by our material operating subsidiaries (other than our insurance companies) and are secured by first and second lien security interests on all of our assets and the assets of our material operating subsidiaries (other than our insurance companies), including a pledge of 100% of the stock of AIC.\nIn February 2012, we exercised our right to defer interest payments on selected notes payable beginning with the scheduled interest payment due in March 2012 and continuing for a period of up to five years. Accumulated deferred interest will be due and payable at the expiration of the extension period.\nIf we are unable to make required payments under the senior facility, subordinated facility and notes payable, or if we are unable to payoff, refinance or extend the maturity of our credit facilities when they mature, it would have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our creditors and stockholders.\nWe are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants under our credit facilities that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur credit facilities contain restrictive debt covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7\nBorrow money;\n\u00b7\nPay dividends and make distributions;\n\u00b7\nIssue stock;\n\u00b7\nMake certain investments;\n\u00b7\nUse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u00b7\nCreate liens;\n\u00b7\nEnter into affiliate transactions;\n\u00b7\nMerge or consolidate; or\n\u00b7\nTransfer and sell assets.\nOur credit facilities also require us to meet certain financial tests, and our need to meet the requirements of these financial tests may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies. If we are unable to maintain compliance with our debt covenants, it would have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our creditors and stockholders.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and the failure of these systems could disrupt our operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our current information technology and telecommunications systems as well as our recently implemented integrated policy and claims system. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations, as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development. As a result, the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner. This could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may experience difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems, including loss of data and decreases in productivity until personnel become familiar with new systems. In addition, our management information systems will require modification and refinement as we grow and as our business needs change, which could prolong difficulties we experience with systems transitions, and we may not always employ the most effective systems for our purposes. If we experience difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or experience significant system failures, or if we are unable to successfully modify our management information systems and respond to changes in our business needs, our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nWe could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches.\nBecause we rely on information technology and telecommunications systems to operate our business, and we store large amounts of data, including personal information regarding our customers, a loss of data or security breach involving those systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability, or otherwise harm our business. Additionally, we rely on third parties and their information technology systems to provide services associated with certain aspects of our business. Although we have implemented systems and processes designed to protect personal information regarding our customers and prevent data loss and other security breaches, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nSevere weather conditions and other catastrophes may result in an increase in the number and amount of claims filed against us.\nOur business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophic events, such as rainstorms, snowstorms, hail and ice storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires and other events such as explosions, terrorist attacks and riots. The incidence and severity of catastrophes and severe weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. Such conditions generally result in higher incidence of automobile accidents and an increase in the number of claims filed, as well as the amount of compensation sought by claimants.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of our own, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries, which include our agency subsidiaries and our insurance company subsidiaries.\nState insurance laws restrict the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends. These subsidiaries may not issue an \u201cextraordinary dividend\u201d until 30 days after the applicable commissioner of insurance has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected in such time or until the commissioner has approved the payment of the extraordinary dividend within the 30-day period. In most states, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution of cash or other property whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of 10.0% of the insurance company\u2019s surplus as of the preceding year-end or the insurance company\u2019s net income for the preceding year, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. In addition, dividends may only be paid from unassigned earnings and an insurance company\u2019s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. As of December 31, 2014, our insurance companies could not pay ordinary dividends to us without prior regulatory approval due to a negative unassigned surplus position of Affirmative Insurance Company. However, our non-insurance company subsidiaries provide adequate cash flow to fund their own operations.", "PERMNO": 90273, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "AFFMQ"}
