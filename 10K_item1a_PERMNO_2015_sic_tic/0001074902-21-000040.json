{"cik": "1074902", "company": "LCNB CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are risks inherent in LCNB\u2019s operations, many beyond management\u2019s control, which may adversely affect its financial condition and results from operations and should be considered in evaluating the Company. Credit, market, operational, liquidity, interest rate and other risks are described elsewhere in this report. Other risk factors may include the items described below.\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Conditions\nThe ultimate long-term impact on LCNB's business and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on\nfuture developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic\nand actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. Governments, businesses, and the public have taken and are taking unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of or restrictions on the operations of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief. While the effects of COVID-19 are rapidly evolving and not fully known, the pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade and supply chains. If these effects continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified in this Form 10-K could be exacerbated and such effects could have a material adverse impact on us in a number of ways related to credit, collateral, customer demand, funding, operations, interest rate risk, human capital and self-insurance.\nBecause there have been no comparable recent global pandemics that resulted in similar global impact, we do not yet know the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s effects on our business, operations, or the U.S. economy as a whole. Any future development will be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new strains of the virus that cause COVID-19 and their effects on the population, the scale of distribution and public acceptance of vaccines for COVID-19 and whether these vaccines will be effective against any new strains that may emerge, the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements, third party providers\u2019 ability to support our operation, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The uncertain future development of this crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and capital levels.\nWeakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, may affect us, including requiring us to record additional loan loss provision or to charge off loans.\nLCNB\u2019s success depends, in part, on economic and political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental fiscal and monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy and other factors beyond LCNB\u2019s control, especially in light of COVID-19, may affect its deposit levels and composition, demand for loans, the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing the loans it makes. Economic turmoil in different regions of the world affect the economy and stock prices in the United States, which can affect LCNB\u2019s earnings and capital and the ability of its customers to repay loans. Due to LCNB\u2019s volume of real estate loans, declining real estate values could affect the value of property used as collateral as well as LCNB\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure.\nIf the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which LCNB conducts operations decline, this could result in, among other things, a deterioration of credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a resultant effect on the loan portfolio and allowance for credit losses. These factors could also result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would materially affect LCNB's financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that LCNB's non-impaired loans will not become impaired or that impaired loans will not suffer further deterioration in value. The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may result in increased charge-offs and, consequently, reduce net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material impact on LCNB's operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nLCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDeclining values of real estate, increases in unemployment, insurance market disruptions, and the related effects on local economies may increase LCNB's credit losses, which would negatively affect financial results.\nLCNB offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer, and other loans. Many loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) within LCNB's market area. A major change in the real estate market, such as deterioration in the value of collateral or in the local or national economy, could affect customers\u2019 ability to pay these loans, which in turn could impact LCNB's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, increases in unemployment also may affect the ability of certain clients to repay loans and the financial results of commercial clients in localities with higher unemployment, may result in loan defaults and foreclosures and may impair the value of loan collateral. This is especially relevant in light of COVID-19's impact on national and local economies. Loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry and management tries to limit exposure to this risk by monitoring carefully LCNB's extensions of credit. LCNB cannot fully eliminate credit risk and, as a result, credit losses may increase in the future.\nRisks Related to LCNB's Operations\nLCNB\u2019s loan portfolio includes a substantial amount of commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans, which may have more risks than residential or consumer loans.\nLCNB\u2019s commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans comprise a substantial portion of its total loan portfolio. These loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than home equity, residential mortgage, or consumer loans. The potential for increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on businesses and loans secured by income-producing properties, and the continual evaluation and monitoring of these types of loans.\nThe repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent upon the successful operation, development, or sale of the related real estate or commercial business and may, therefore, be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or economy. If the cash flow from operations is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. In such cases, LCNB may take actions to protect its financial interest in the loan. Such actions may include foreclosure on the real estate securing the loan, taking possession of other collateral that may have been pledged as security for the loan, or modifying the terms of the loan. If foreclosed on, commercial real estate is often unique and may be difficult to liquidate.\nFuture growth and expansion opportunities may contain risks.\nFrom time to time LCNB may seek to acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions or may open new branch offices. It may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. Such activities involve a number of risks, which may include potential inaccuracies in estimates and judgments used to evaluate the expansion opportunity, diversion of management and employee attention, lack of experience in a new market or product or service, and difficulties in integrating a future acquisition or introducing a new product or service. There is no assurance that such growth or expansion activities will be successful or that they will achieve desired profitability levels.\nLCNB\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates LCNB\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of LCNB\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to its controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on LCNB\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nLCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLCNB\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption, cyberattack, or other breach in security.\nLCNB relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Although significant resources are devoted to maintaining and regularly updating LCNB\u2019s data systems, there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security. Any failure, interruption, cyberattack, email phishing scam, or other breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in LCNB\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems. While LCNB has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, cyberattack, or other security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such occurrences will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, cyberattacks, phishing scams, or other security breaches of LCNB\u2019s information systems could significantly disrupt LCNB's operations, allow misappropriation of LCNB\u2019s confidential information, allow misappropriation of customer confidential information, damage LCNB\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject LCNB to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose LCNB to significant civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nLCNB\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends is limited.\nLCNB is dependent upon the earnings of the Bank for funds to pay dividends on its common shares. The payment of dividends by LCNB and the Bank is subject to certain regulatory restrictions. As a result, any payment of dividends in the future will be dependent, in large part, on the ability of LCNB and the Bank to satisfy these regulatory restrictions and on the Bank\u2019s earnings, capital levels, financial condition, and other factors. Although LCNB\u2019s financial earnings and financial condition have allowed it to declare and pay periodic cash dividends to shareholders, there can be no assurance that the current dividend policy or the amount of dividend distributions will continue in the future.\nRisk factors related to LCNB\u2019s Wealth Management business.\nCompetition for wealth management business is intense. Competitors include other commercial bank and trust companies, brokerage firms, investment advisory firms, mutual fund companies, accountants, and attorneys.\nLCNB\u2019s Wealth Management business is directly affected by conditions in the debt and equity securities markets. The debt and equity securities markets are affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, all of which are beyond LCNB\u2019s control. Changes in economic conditions may directly affect the economic performance of the trust accounts in which clients\u2019 assets are invested. A decline in the fair value of the trust accounts caused by a decline in general economic conditions directly affects LCNB\u2019s trust fee income because such fees are primarily based on the fair value of the trust accounts. In addition, a sustained decrease in the performance of the trust accounts or a lack of sustained growth may encourage clients to seek alternative investment options.\nThe management of trust accounts is subject to the risk of mistaken distributions, poor investment choices, and miscellaneous other incorrect decisions. Such mistakes may give rise to surcharge actions by beneficiaries, with damages substantially in excess of the fees earned from management of the accounts.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFailure to meet regulatory capital requirements could adversely affect LCNB\u2019s business.\nThe Bank is subject to regulations requiring it to satisfy minimum capital requirements, see Note 1 - Regulatory Matters of the consolidated financial statements for more information. While management expects that LCNB's capital ratios under Basel III will continue to exceed well capitalized minimum capital requirements, there can be no assurance that such will be the case. If LCNB is unable to meet or exceed applicable minimum capital requirements, it may become subject to supervisory actions including, but not limited to, requirements to raise additional capital or dispose of assets, the loss of its financial holding company status, limitations on its ability to engage in new acquisitions or new activities, or other informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions.\nLCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLCNB\u2019s earnings are significantly affected by market interest rates.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact LCNB\u2019s profitability. A primary source of income from operations is net interest income, which is equal to the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities and the interest paid for deposits and other borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond LCNB\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, the slope of the yield curve (that is, the relationship between short and long-term interest rates), and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States Federal government. LCNB expects the current level of interest rates and the current slope of the yield curve will cause further downward pressure on its net interest margin.\nIncreases in general interest rates could have a negative impact on LCNB\u2019s results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. Some residential real estate mortgage loans, most home equity line of credit loans, and many of LCNB\u2019s commercial loans have adjustable rates. Borrower inability to make scheduled loan payments due to a higher loan cost could result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures, and write-offs and may necessitate additions to the allowance for loan losses. In addition, increases in the general level of interest rates may decrease the demand for new consumer and commercial loans, thus limiting LCNB\u2019s growth and profitability. A general increase in interest rates may also result in deposit disintermediation, which is the flow of deposits away from banks and other depository institutions into direct investments that have the potential for higher rates of return, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. If this occurs, LCNB may have to rely more heavily on borrowings as a source of funds in the future, which could negatively impact its net interest margin.\nGains from sales of mortgage loans may experience significant volatility.\nGains from sales of mortgage loans are highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity. A decrease in market interest rates may create a refinancing demand for residential fixed-rate mortgage loans, which may cause an increase in gains from sales of mortgage loans if LCNB sells these loans in the secondary market. An increase in market interest rates may decrease the demand for refinanced loans and decrease the gains from sales of mortgage loans recognized in LCNB\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains from sales of mortgage loans may also be impacted by changes in LCNB\u2019s strategy to manage its residential mortgage portfolio. For example, LCNB may occasionally change the proportion of loan originations that are sold in the secondary market and instead add a greater proportion to its loan portfolio.\nBanking competition is intense.\nLCNB faces strong competition for deposits, loans, trust accounts, and other services from other banks, savings banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers, and other financial institutions located in its markets. Many of LCNB\u2019s competitors include major financial institutions that have been in business for many years and have established customer bases, numerous branches, substantially higher regulatory lending limits, and the ability to mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. In addition, credit unions are growing larger due to more flexible membership requirement regulations and are offering more financial services than they legally could in the past.\nLCNB also competes with numerous real estate brokerage firms, some owned by realty companies, for residential real estate mortgage loans. The banking industry now competes with brokerage firms and mutual fund companies for funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of these competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.\nIf LCNB is unable to attract and retain loan, deposit, brokerage, and Wealth Management customers, its growth and profitability levels may be negatively impacted.\nLCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEconomic conditions in LCNB's market areas could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nLCNB conducts its operations from offices that are located in nine Southwestern Ohio counties and in Franklin County, Ohio, from which substantially all of its customer base is drawn. Because of this geographic concentration of operations and customer base, LCNB's financial performance is heavily influenced by economic conditions in these areas. Any material deterioration in economic conditions in these markets could have material direct or indirect adverse impacts on LCNB's customers and on LCNB. Such deterioration could increase the number of customers experiencing financial distress, negatively impacting their ability to obtain new loans or to repay existing loans. As a result, LCNB may experience increases in the levels of impaired loans, increased charge-offs, and increased provisions for loan losses. Deteriorating economic conditions may also affect the ability of depositors to maintain or add to deposit balances and may affect the demand for loans, Wealth Management, brokerage, and other products and services offered by LCNB. Such losses and decreased demand could have material adverse effects on LCNB's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject LCNB to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, LCNB may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or products and services, LCNB may invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. If LCNB is unable to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services, it could have a material adverse effect on LCNB\u2019s business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses may be inadequate.\nThe provision for loan losses is determined by management based upon its evaluation of the amount needed to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate in relation to the estimated risk of losses inherent in the portfolio. In addition to historic charge-off percentages, factors taken into consideration to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the nature, volume, and consistency of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, a review of specific problem loans, the fair value of any underlying collateral, borrowers\u2019 cash flows, and current economic conditions that may affect borrowers\u2019 ability to make payments. Increases in the allowance result in an expense for the period. By its nature, the evaluation is imprecise and requires significant judgment. Actual results may vary significantly from management\u2019s assumptions. If, as a result of general economic conditions or a decrease in asset quality, management determines that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary, LCNB will incur additional expenses.\nThe fair value of LCNB\u2019s investments could decline.\nMost of LCNB\u2019s investment securities portfolio is designated as available-for-sale. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale portfolio is recorded as other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity. The fair value of LCNB\u2019s investment portfolio may decline, causing a corresponding decline in shareholders\u2019 equity. Management believes that several factors will affect the fair values of the investment portfolio including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates or expectations of changes, the degree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation rates or expectations of inflation, and the slope of the interest rate yield curve. These and other factors may impact specific categories of the portfolio differently and the effect any of these factors may have on any specific category of the portfolio cannot be predicted.\nMany state and local governmental authorities have experienced deterioration of financial condition in recent years due to declining tax revenues, increased demand for services, and various other factors. To the extent LCNB has any municipal securities in its portfolio from issuers who are experiencing deterioration of financial condition or who may experience future deterioration of financial condition, the value of such securities may decline and could result in other-than-temporary impairment charges, which could have an adverse effect on LCNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, a general, industry-wide decline in the fair value of municipal securities could significantly affect LCNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax law and accounting standards could materially affect LCNB's operations.\nChanges in tax laws, or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, could materially adversely affect LCNB\u2019s operations. Similarly, new accounting standards, changes to existing accounting standards, and changes to the methods of preparing financial statements could impact LCNB\u2019s reported financial condition and results of operations. These factors are outside LCNB\u2019s control and it is impossible to predict changes that may occur and the effect of such changes.\nLCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLCNB is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Bank may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Bank may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Bank to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Bank\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Bank\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Bank has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on LCNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe banking industry is highly regulated.\nLCNB is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC. LCNB and the Bank are also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC as the deposit insurer. The CFPB is responsible for most consumer protection laws and has broad authority, with certain exceptions, to regulate financial products offered by banks. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters including, but not limited to, changes in the ownership or control of banks, maintenance of adequate capital, permissible business operations, maintenance of deposit insurance, protection of customer financial privacy, the level of reserves held against deposits, restrictions on dividend payments, the making of loans, and the acceptance of deposits. See the previous section titled \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d for more information on this subject.\nFederal regulators may initiate various enforcement actions against a financial institution that violates laws or regulations or that operates in an unsafe or unsound manner. These enforcement actions may include, but are not limited to, the assessment of civil money penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist or removal orders, and the imposition of written agreements.\nProposals to change the laws governing financial institutions are periodically introduced in Congress and proposals to change regulations are periodically considered by the regulatory bodies. Such future legislation and/or changes in regulations could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The likelihood of any major changes in the future and their effects are impossible to predict.\nFDIC deposit insurance assessments may materially increase in the future.\nDeposits of LCNB are insured up to statutory limits by the FDIC and, accordingly, LCNB and other banks and financial institutions pay quarterly premiums to the FDIC to maintain the DIF. The likelihood and extent of future rate increases are indeterminable.\nLCNB continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. LCNB\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in LCNB\u2019s operations. LCNB may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect LCNB\u2019s growth, revenue and profit.\nEmergence of non-bank alternatives to the financial system.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions. Technology and other changes, including the emergence of \u201cFintech Companies,\u201d are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can complete transactions, such as paying bills and/or transferring funds, directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLCNB CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nClimate change, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, epidemics and other external events could significantly impact LCNB\u2019s business.\nNatural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on LCNB\u2019s ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for LCNB or its customers. Such events could affect the stability of LCNB\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue, or cause LCNB to incur additional expenses.", "PERMNO": 13007, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "LCNB"}
