Risk Factors\nOur business and an investment in our common stock are subject to a variety of risks. The following risk factors describe some of the material factors that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the market price for our common stock. Many of these events are outside of our control. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the market price of our common stock could decline and investors in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThis summary is not complete and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth below.\nRisks Related to Our Outstanding Indebtedness, Need for Additional Financing and Financial Condition\n\u25cf We have a history of significant losses and will likely need additional financing to satisfy our anticipated future liquidity requirements.\n\u25cf We have indebtedness that is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2021, which we may be unable to refinance or extend the maturity date.\n\u25cf The terms of our Second A&R Credit Agreement give the lender sole discretion on our ability to access the additional $5 million in term loans thereunder and impose substantial limitations on the operation of our business and covenant requirements we may be unable to achieve.\n\u25cf The anticipated replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could affect our interest rates.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf We may not be able to compete successfully because we are smaller and have fewer financial resources and less ability to invest in the development of new products.\n\u25cf If we are unable to develop and market new products and technologies, our business may be negatively affected.\n\u25cf Our biologics business is highly dependent on the availability of human donors.\n\u25cf Negative publicity concerning methods of tissue recovery and screening of donor tissue could reduce demand for our biologics products and impact the supply of available donor tissue.\n\u25cf We are highly dependent on the continued availability of our facilities.\n\u25cf We are subject to product liability litigation that could be expensive if it exceeds our insurance coverage.\n\u25cf We have completed business combinations in the past which involve risks and may do so in the future.\n\u25cf Our quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations and are not indicative of annual results.\n\u25cf We operate in some markets outside the United States that expose us to additional risks.\n\u25cf Our ability to deduct interest is limited.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation\n\u25cf Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation, including product approvals and clearances and healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and physician payment transparency laws.\n\u25cf Governmental regulation could restrict the use of our tissue products or our procurement of tissue.\n\u25cf Outside of the United States, our medical devices must comply with the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which they are marketed, and compliance may be costly and time-consuming.\n\u25cf Modifications to our products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\n\u25cf Our manufacturing operations are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s and other governmental authorities\u2019 laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and production of medical devices.\n\u25cf Even if our products are cleared or approved by regulatory authorities, they could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\n\u25cf The use, misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits.\n\u25cf If our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations and likely litigation.\n\u25cf Any future product recall or voluntary market withdrawal of a product due to defects, enhancements and modifications or other reasons could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\u25cf If we or our suppliers fail to comply with FDA or other regulatory requirements pertaining to human tissue products, these products could be subject to withdrawal from the market or other enforcement action.\n\u25cf Loss of AATB accreditation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf Federal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and our business.\n\u25cf Product pricing is subject to regulatory control, which could impact our revenue and other operating results.\n\u25cf Our revenues depend upon prompt and adequate coverage and reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\n\u25cf Substantially all of our revenue is conducted through independent distributors and sales agents who we do not control.\n\u25cf We depend on third-party suppliers for products, components and raw materials.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Management\n\u25cf We have limited staffing and are dependent upon key employees and qualified personnel, and competition for such talent is intense, especially around Belgrade, Montana.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\u25cf We could be required to pay damages or prevented from selling our products due to intellectual property lawsuits.\n\u25cf If our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\n\u25cf We may not be able to obtain or protect our proprietary rights relating to our products.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Protection\n\u25cf We are dependent on various information technology systems, which are substantially outdated and in need of significant upgrades or conversion to a new enterprise resource planning system.\nRisks Related to Our Controlled Company Status\n\u25cf OrbiMed funds own a significant percentage of our common stock, have the right to designate a majority of our Board of Directors, and are able to exert significant control over our Company and management.\n\u25cf We are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE American rules.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u25cf Shares of our common stock are equity securities and subordinate to our outstanding indebtedness.\n\u25cf The market price of our common stock is extremely volatile.\n\u25cf We may issue additional common stock resulting in stock ownership dilution, and the sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or other equity securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u25cf Our common stock may be delisted if we do not comply with the NYSE American continued listing requirements.\n\u25cf Anti-takeover provisions may discourage or prevent a change in control.\n\u25cf We are authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock without stockholder approval.\n\u25cf Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCharter\u201d) designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders.\n\u25cf We have never paid dividends and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u25cf Worldwide economic instability and social unrest could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\u25cf Changes in accounting standards, policies, or assumptions utilized in determining accounting estimates could adversely affect our financial statements, including our operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf The requirements of being a public company may cause difficulties for our Company.\n\u25cf We may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nRisks Related to Our Outstanding Indebtedness, Need for Additional Financing and Financial Condition\nWe have incurred significant losses, expect to continue to incur losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of incurring net losses, and at December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $230.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net loss of $7.1 million. Our ability to achieve profitability will be influenced by many factors, including, among others, the level and timing of future revenues and expenditures; development, commercialization, market acceptance and availability and supply of our products; competing technologies and market developments; regulatory requirements and delays; and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. As a result, we may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. These losses will continue to have an adverse impact on our stockholders\u2019 equity, and we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe recently signed a securities purchase agreement with an investor for a $20 milion private placement, which may not close as anticipated.\nOn February 22, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single healthcare-focused institutional investor pursuant to which we agreed to issue 8,888,890 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share and warrants to purchase up to 6,666,668 shares of our common stock in a private placement. The closing of this private placement is expected to occur on February 24, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. We expect to receive gross proceeds of approximately $20 million, before deducting fees and other estimated offering expenses from the Private Placement, and expect to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement for working capital and other general corporate purposes. No assurance can be provided that the conditions to closing will be satisfied or that the closing of this private placement will occur as anticipated on February 24, 2021 or at all.\nWe may need additional financing to satisfy our anticipated future liquidity requirements, which financing may not be available on favorable terms at the time it is needed and which could reduce our operational and strategic flexibility.\nAlthough it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $2.3 million as of December 31, 2020, together with anticipated cash flows from operations, the anticipated net proceeds from our pending private placement and existing credit availability under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Royalty Opportunities and ROS, as amended (the \u201cSecond A&R Credit Agreement\u201d) which we expect to replace or extend prior to its December 31, 2021 maturity date, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the end of February 2022. Although we have availability under our Second A&R Credit Agreement, our ability to obtain additional term loans under this facility is in the sole and absolute discretion of the lender. In addition, this credit facility expires December 31, 2021, and all of our indebtedness thereunder matures on such date. While we intend to extend the maturity date of or replace this facility prior to the maturity date, no assurance can be provided that we will do so on terms that are favorable to us or at all. In addition, we may require or we may seek additional funds to fund our future operations and business strategy prior to February 2022. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will not need or seek additional funding at any time. We may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if market conditions for raising additional capital are favorable. We may seek to raise additional funds through various sources, such as equity and debt financings, additional debt restructurings or refinancings, or through strategic collaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure additional sources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs or on terms acceptable to us. This is particularly true if economic and market conditions deteriorate. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could result in our inability to pay our expenses as they come due, limit our ability to expand our business operations, and harm our overall business prospects. If adequate funds are not otherwise available, we could be required to curtail operations significantly, including reducing our sales and marketing expenses, which could negatively impact product sales, delaying new product initiatives, and we could even be required to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection.\nTo the extent we raise additional financing through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities or the restructuring or refinancing of our outstanding debt, the interests of our current stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include discounted equity purchase prices, warrant coverage, or liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders. If we issue common stock, we may do so at purchase prices that represent a discount to our trading price and/or we may issue warrants to purchasers, which could dilute our current stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect the rights of our stockholders or reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Prior to raising additional equity or debt financing, we must obtain the consent of Royalty Opportunities, the lender under our Second A&R Credit Agreement, and ROS and Royalty Opportunities, parties to an Investor Rights Agreement dated February 14, 2018 with the Company (the \u201cInvestor Rights Agreement\u201d), and no assurance can be provided that Royalty Opportunities and ROS would provide such consent, which could limit our ability to raise additional financing.\nWe have indebtedness which matures on December 31, 2021. We may not be able to extend the maturity date of or replace our credit facility or generate enough cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAlthough we completed a debt restructuring during 2020 that reduced the amount of our indebtedness, as of December 31, 2020, we still had $15.6 million of principal outstanding under our credit facility, which matures on December 31, 2021. Although we believe that we will be able to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or extend the maturity date of that facility, no assurance can be provided that we will do so on terms that are favorable to us or at all. Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, including amounts borrowed under our credit facility, and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures, contractual cash obligations, known and unknown liabilities, research and development efforts, working capital, any future acquisitions and business combinations, and other general corporate purposes depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity dates thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek to raise additional capital, or take other similar actions. We may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, the consent of our lender, and other factors, including market conditions. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would likely have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u25cf make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u25cf restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions, business combinations or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u25cf limit our ability to borrow additional amounts or raise financing for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, research and development efforts, acquisitions or business combinations, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or other purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness, and if we do, the risks related to our business and our ability to service our indebtedness would increase.\nA failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our Second A&R Credit Agreement could require the immediate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the credit agreement, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible, or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nThe terms of our Second A&R Credit Agreement substantially limit our ability to conduct and invest in our business, take advantage of business opportunities, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions.\nOur Second A&R Credit Agreement includes a number of significant financial and operating restrictions. For example, the agreement contains financial covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum liquidity covenant, as defined in the agreement, and contains provisions that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to, among other things:\n\u25cf make loans and investments, including acquisitions and transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf create liens or other encumbrances on our assets;\n\u25cf dispose of assets;\n\u25cf enter into contingent obligations;\n\u25cf comply with NYSE American rules and regulations;\n\u25cf engage in mergers or consolidations; and\n\u25cf pay dividends.\nWe may be unable to comply with these covenants, which could result in a default under the agreement. In addition, these provisions may limit our ability to conduct and invest in our business, take advantage of business opportunities, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. In addition, they may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer, if any, restrictions or may otherwise adversely affect our business. Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as significant acquisitions or business combinations, may be subject to the consent of the lender, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction. In addition, the lender is also a party to an Investor Rights Agreement with us which further substantially limits the operation of our business and the ability of our management to conduct and invest in our business.\nOur credit facility involves additional risks that may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAvailability of additional term loans under the Second A&R Credit Agreement is based on the amount of our liquidity and revenue and is also subject to the sole and absolute discretion of the lender. As a result, our access to credit under the Second A&R Credit Agreement is subject to fluctuations depending on our financial results and projected cash balances as of any valuation date as well as the discretion of the lender. Our inability to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility if and when we need them may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at variable rates, which subjects us to interest rate risk and could increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness. The impact of increases in interest rates could be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of the amount of our outstanding indebtedness, thereby affecting our profitability. In the event of a default under our Second A&R Credit Agreement, the lender may terminate its commitments to lend additional money under the credit facility and declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Second A&R Credit Agreement, the lender thereunder may elect to increase the rates at which interest accrues. Subject to certain exceptions, amounts outstanding under the credit facility are secured by a senior first priority security interest in substantially all existing and after-acquired assets of our Company and each borrower. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the lender could seek to enforce security interests in our assets securing our indebtedness under the credit facility, including restricting our access to collections on our accounts receivable. Any acceleration of amounts due under our Second A&R Credit Agreement or the exercise by the lender thereto of its rights under the security documents, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may be unable to meet financial or other covenant requirements in our Second A&R Credit Agreement, and we may be unable to successfully negotiate waivers to cure any covenant violations.\nOur Second A&R Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, fees, affirmative and negative covenants, including a minimum liquidity covenant and substantial operating covenants, and default provisions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreement. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Second A&R Credit Agreement, the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lender accelerates the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness. Also, should there be an event of default, or should we need to obtain waivers following an event of default, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and/or more restrictive covenants in future periods. In addition, to secure the performance of our obligations under the Second A&R Credit Agreement, we pledged substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, to the lender. Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Second A&R Credit Agreement could result in an event of default, the acceleration of our debt and the loss of our assets.\nThe anticipated replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could affect interest rates under our Second A&R Credit Agreement, which may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to cease sustaining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), which is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans, by the end of 2021. In April 2018, the New York Federal Reserve Bank began publishing its alternative rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. In early 2019, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee proposed that SOFR be utilized as the replacement for LIBOR. However, there is still uncertainty as to whether and when SOFR or another alternative rate will be adopted as the replacement for LIBOR. On November 30, 2020 the ICE Benchmark Administration announced its intention to extend from December 31, 2021 to June 20, 2023 the date most U.S. LIBOR rates (including the LIBO Rate as defined in the Second A&R Credit Agreement) would cease being computed and announced.\nIf LIBOR ceases to exist before our Second A&R Credit Agreement is terminated, we may need to renegotiate this agreement, since borrowings thereunder are indexed to the LIBO Rate, as such term is defined in the agreement and if such LIBO Rate is not determinable the interest rate will equal the interest rate in effect for immediately preceding Interest Period, as such term is defined in the agreement. This may increase or otherwise affect interest rates under our Second A&R Credit Agreement. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of LIBOR, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement. However, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after June 30, 2023, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition may be on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business, operating results and financial condition have been and will likely continue to be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused business closures, severe travel restrictions and the implementation of social distancing measures. Hospitals and other medical facilities have cancelled or deferred elective procedures, diverted resources to patients suffering from infections and limited access for non-patients, including our distributors and independent sales representatives. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons and their patients have been, and may continue to be, required, or are choosing, to defer procedures in which our products otherwise would be used, and many facilities that specialize in the procedures in which our products otherwise would be used have experienced temporary closures or reduced operating hours. These circumstances have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the ability of our employees, independent sales representatives and distributors to effectively market and sell our products, which has had and will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenues. In addition, even after the easing of such restrictions such that governmental orders no longer prohibit or recommend against performing such procedures, patients may continue to defer such procedures out of concern of being exposed to COVID-19 or for other reasons.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused adverse effects on general commercial activity and the global economy, which has led to an economic slowdown and recession and could cause other unpredictable events, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. The adverse effect of the pandemic on the broader economy also will likely negatively affect demand for procedures using our products, both in the near- and long-term. No assurance can be provided that our revenues will ever return to pre-COVID-19 levels. In addition, as a result of this negative effect on our economy, one or more of our distributors, independent sales representatives, customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers may experience financial distress, cancel, postpone or delay orders, be unable to perform under a contract, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business or we may need to offer special payment terms or relief to our distributors, independent sales representatives and customers. Accordingly, we believe we are exposed to heightened credit risk as a result of the pandemic. This could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and provide products and otherwise operate our business, as well as increase our costs and expenses.\nThe decline in our revenues and adverse impact of the pandemic on our other operating results could impact our debt covenants under our credit facility and our ability to access funding thereunder or refinance that debt or extend its maturity date. We may need to borrow funds from alternative sources, such as other lenders and institutions or government agencies. There can be no guarantee that such borrowing will be available or available on favorable terms or without restrictions that may otherwise impair our operating flexibility. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to and could continue to lead to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase our cost of future capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 have resulted, and could continue to result, in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, prospects and the trading price of our common stock throughout 2021. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, actions that federal, state and local governmental or regulatory agencies take in response to COVID-19, and other actions to contain it or treat its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic also heightens the risks in certain of the other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.\nMany competitive products exist, and we expect more will be developed. Our operating results have suffered due to intense competition and we may not be able to compete successfully because we are smaller and have fewer financial resources and less ability to invest in the development of new products.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological change. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products for use by our customers. Many of the companies developing or marketing competitive products enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including greater financial and human resources for product development and sales and marketing; greater name recognition; established relationships with surgeons, hospitals and third-party payors; broader product lines and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and established sales and marketing and distribution networks. Our competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than us, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for competing products more rapidly than us, develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive or acquire technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Not all of our sales and other personnel have non-compete agreements. We also compete with other organizations in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and management personnel. If our competitors are more successful than us in these matters, we may be unable to compete successfully against our existing or future competitors. Our industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industry not involving our Company could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We may be unable to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\nIf we are unable to develop and market new products and technologies, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products, or our products could become obsolete, and our business and operating results would suffer.\nDue to lack of funding, our research and development efforts and ability to develop new products have suffered during the past several years. We may be unable to compete effectively with our competitors unless we can keep up with existing or new products and technologies in the markets in which we compete. If we do not continue to introduce new products and technologies, or if those products and technologies are not accepted, we may not be successful. Moreover, research and development efforts require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material, or innovation and our current and recent annual operating plans have not provided for any significant investment in new products. Demand for our products also could change in ways we may not anticipate due to evolving customer needs, changing demographics, slow industry growth rates, declines in our markets, the introduction of new products and technologies, evolving surgical philosophies, and evolving industry standards, among others. Additionally, our competitors\u2019 new products and technologies may beat our products to market, may be more effective or less expensive than our products, or may render our products obsolete. It is also important that we carefully manage our introduction of new and enhanced products and technologies. If potential customers delay purchases until new or enhanced products are available, it could negatively impact our revenue. Our new products and technologies also could reduce demand for or render our existing products obsolete and thus adversely affect sales of our existing products and lead to increased expense for excess and obsolete inventory.\nOur biologics business is highly dependent on the availability of human donors. Any disruptions could cause our customers to seek alternative providers or technologies and harm our business and operating results.\nOur biologics business is highly dependent on our ability to obtain donor cadavers as the raw material for many of our biologics products. The availability of acceptable donors is relatively limited, and we compete with many other companies for this limited availability. The availability of donors is also impacted by regulatory changes, general public opinion of the donor process and our reputation for our handling of the donor process. In addition, due to seasonal changes in the mortality rates, some scarce tissues are at times in short supply. A disruption in the supply of this crucial raw material could have significant consequences for our revenue, operating results and continued operations.\nNegative publicity concerning methods of tissue recovery and screening of donor tissue in our industry could reduce demand for our biologics products and impact the supply of available donor tissue.\nMedia reports or other negative publicity concerning both alleged improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and disease transmission from donated tissue could limit widespread acceptance of some of our biologics products. Unfavorable reports of improper or illegal tissue recovery practices, both in the United States and internationally, as well as incidents of improperly processed tissue leading to the transmission of disease, may broadly affect the rate of future tissue donation and market acceptance of technologies incorporating human tissue. In addition, such negative publicity could cause the families of potential donors to become reluctant to agree to donate tissue to for-profit tissue processors.\nWe are highly dependent on the continued availability of our facilities and would be harmed if they were unavailable for any prolonged period of time.\nAny failure in the physical infrastructure of our facilities or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues and harm our business reputation and financial results. We are highly reliant on our Belgrade, Montana facilities. Any natural or man-made event that impacts our ability to utilize these facilities could have a significant impact on our operating results, reputation and ability to continue operations. The regulatory process for approval of facilities is time-consuming and our ability to rebuild facilities would take a considerable amount of time and expense and cause a significant disruption in service to our customers. Further, the FDA or some other regulatory agency could identify deficiencies in future inspections of our facilities or our supplies that could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\nWe have pending product liability litigation that could be expensive, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate in a catastrophic situation.\nThe manufacture and sale of medical devices and biologics expose us to significant risk of product liability claims, which are made against us from time to time. We may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims, including product liability claims arising out of the use of our products, if the liabilities exceed or are not covered under our insurance program. We are currently involved in pending product liability litigation. While we believe these matters will be covered under our product liability insurance, no assurance can be provided that any amounts required to be paid to resolve these or any future matters will be within our insurance limits.\nWe also could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, other safety issues, or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts and product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, significant litigation and other costs, substantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients, product recalls, loss of revenue, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the inability to commercialize new products or product candidates, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. We currently carry product liability insurance; however, our insurance coverage may not be adequate, and our business could suffer material adverse consequences due to product liability claims.\nWe have completed acquisitions and business combinations in the past and may complete them in the future. Acquisitions and business combinations are risky and may harm our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have completed acquisitions and business combinations in the past, including the acquisition of X-spine Systems, Inc. in 2015, and may complete acquisitions and business combinations in the future. Our ability to complete acquisitions and business combinations will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions; our ability to compete effectively for acquisition candidates; and the availability of capital and personnel to complete such acquisitions and run the acquired business effectively. Any acquisition or business combination could impair our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. The benefits of an acquisition or business combination may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that previous or future acquisitions or business combinations will, in fact, produce any benefits. Acquisitions and business combinations may involve a number of risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, including:\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf disruption to our existing operations and plans;\n\u25cf inability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\n\u25cf difficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations, manufacturing processes and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and synergies;\n\u25cf inability to successfully integrate or develop a distribution channel for acquired product lines;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, or sales representatives of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, and sales representatives;\n\u25cf adverse impact on overall profitability if our expanded operations do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;\n\u25cf reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay acquisition purchase prices or other business venture investment costs, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u25cf infringement by acquired businesses or other business ventures of intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf violation of confidentiality, intellectual property and non-compete obligations or agreements by employees of an acquired business or lack of or inadequate formal intellectual property protection mechanisms in place at an acquired business;\n\u25cf inaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition investments, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs;\n\u25cf incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions and incurrence of non-recurring charges; and\n\u25cf write-off of significant amounts of goodwill or other assets as a result of deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line, adverse market conditions, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in laws or regulations that restrict activities of an acquired business or product line, or as a result of a variety of other circumstances.\nIn addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses may result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement, and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Also, some acquisitions may require the consent of the lender under our credit facility and /or the consent of Royalty Opportunities and ROS under the Investor Rights Agreement. We cannot predict whether such approvals would be forthcoming or the terms on which the lender or these investors would approve such acquisitions. These risks, among others, could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or other business combination or multiple transactions within a relatively short period of time.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations, and you should not rely on them as an indication of our annual or future results.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results have varied and in the future may vary significantly, and period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our annual results or future performance. Any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by industry analysts or investors, as a result of such quarterly fluctuations or otherwise, could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock in any given period. Our quarterly operating results may vary significantly due to a combination of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u25cf demand for our products;\n\u25cf the impact of COVID-19 on our business or operating results;\n\u25cf the level of competition;\n\u25cf the number, timing, and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors;\n\u25cf our ability to develop, introduce, and market new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;\n\u25cf the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products;\n\u25cf changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in the treatment practices of our customers;\n\u25cf changes in distributor or independent sales representative relationships and sales force size and composition;\n\u25cf the timing of material expense- or income-generating events and the related recognition of their associated financial impact;\n\u25cf the number and mix of products sold in the quarter and the geographies in which they are sold;\n\u25cf the number of selling days;\n\u25cf the availability and cost of components and materials;\n\u25cf the timing of orders and shipments;\n\u25cf ability to obtain reimbursement for our products and the timing of patients\u2019 use of their calendar year medical insurance deductibles;\n\u25cf work stoppages or strikes in our industry;\n\u25cf changes in FDA and foreign governmental regulatory policies, requirements, and enforcement practices;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, estimates, and treatments;\n\u25cf restructuring, impairment, and other special charges;\n\u25cf costs associated with pending and any future litigation;\n\u25cf variations in cost of sales due to the amount and timing of excess and obsolete inventory charges, commodity prices, and manufacturing variances;\n\u25cf income tax fluctuations and changes in tax rules;\n\u25cf general economic, social and other external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf increases of interest rates, which can increase the cost of borrowings under our credit facility, and generally affect the level of economic activity.\nAlthough our international business is not substantial, we do operate in some markets outside the United States that are subject to political, economic, and social instability and expose us to additional risks.\nOperations in countries outside of the United States accounted for approximately 2% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are accompanied by certain financial and other risks. Our international sales operations expose us and our representatives, agents, and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include, among others:\n\u25cf the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations on orthopedic implants and biologic products;\n\u25cf withdrawal from or revision to international trade policies or agreements and the imposition or increases in import and export licensing and other compliance requirements, customs duties and tariffs, import and export quotas and other trade restrictions, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf the imposition of U.S. or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with that country, company, person, or entity;\n\u25cf new or enhanced trade restrictions and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u25cf economic instability, including economic instability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and currency risk between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, in our markets;\n\u25cf economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf scrutiny of foreign tax authorities, which could result in significant fines, penalties, and additional taxes being imposed upon us;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and increases in infrastructure costs including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology;\n\u25cf international pricing pressures;\n\u25cf a shortage of high-quality international salespeople and distributors;\n\u25cf loss of any key personnel who possess proprietary knowledge or are otherwise important to our success in international markets;\n\u25cf changes in third-party reimbursement policy that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate our reducing selling prices for our products;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf differing local product preferences and product requirements and increased costs of customizing products for foreign countries;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions, particularly related to the exportation of our biologic products;\n\u25cf difficulties in protecting, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf foreign currency exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u25cf national and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes, social unrest, acts of war or terrorist acts;\n\u25cf complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws; and\n\u25cf exposure to different legal and political standards.\nIn addition, during the third quarter of 2020, we ceased selling products in the EU after concluding that the cost to maintain our regulatory approvals and sell our products in the EU, especially in light of extensive new legislation, exceeded the benefits of doing business there for Xtant. Our revenues from sales of our products in the EU during 2020 were only $0.2 million and while we believe the anticipated costs to exit the EU will not be significant, no assurance can be provided that the actual costs involved will not exceed our anticipated costs.\nOur ability to deduct interest is limited.\nUnder the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our ability to deduct interest on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business (which excludes investment interest) is limited to an amount equal to the sum of (i) our business interest income during the taxable year and (ii) 30% of our adjusted taxable income for such taxable year. For taxable years beginning after 2021, our adjusted taxable income for purposes of computing the 30% limitation will be reduced by depreciation, amortization and depletion deductions. Disallowed interest deductions are carried forward indefinitely and treated as business interest paid or accrued in the succeeding taxable year.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, including requirements for regulatory clearances or approvals prior to commercial distribution of our products. If we fail to maintain regulatory clearances and approvals, or are unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements, our ability to commercially distribute and market these products could suffer.\nOur medical device products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Government regulation of medical devices is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:\n\u25cf design, development and manufacturing;\n\u25cf testing, labeling, packaging, content and language of instructions for use, and storage;\n\u25cf clinical trials;\n\u25cf product safety;\n\u25cf premarket clearance and approval;\n\u25cf marketing, sales and distribution (including making product claims);\n\u25cf advertising and promotion;\n\u25cf product modifications;\n\u25cf recordkeeping procedures;\n\u25cf reports of corrections, removals, enhancements, recalls and field corrective actions;\n\u25cf post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u25cf complying with the federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (\u201cUDI\u201d) on devices and their labeling and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to FDA\u2019s Global Unique Device Identification Database (\u201cGUDID\u201d); and\n\u25cf product import and export\nBefore a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, an existing product can be marketed in the United States, it must first receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), a de novo classification or a Premarket Approval, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nMost of our currently commercialized products have received premarket clearances under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. In the future, the FDA may determine that our products will require the more costly, lengthy and uncertain de novo or PMA processes. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could adversely affect our revenue. Although we do not currently market any devices under PMA and have not gone through the de novo classification process for marketing authorization, we cannot assure you that the FDA will not demand that we obtain a PMA or de novo classification prior to marketing or that we will be able to obtain 510(k) clearances with respect to future products.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products meet the standard of \u201csubstantial equivalence\u201d for a 510(k) or meet the standard for the FDA to grant a petition for de novo classification;\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u25cf the data from our pre-clinical studies (bench and/or animal) and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval in general or for specific, commercially desirable indications, where required;\n\u25cf the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and\n\u25cf changes in FDA clearance or approval policies or the adoption of new regulations may require additional data.\nIn addition, even if we do obtain clearance or approval, the FDA may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearances or approvals for our products under development could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability.\nWe are subject, directly and indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, and physician payment transparency laws. Failure to comply with these laws may subject us to substantial penalties.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, and physician payment transparency, including false claims laws, anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Many states require compliance with different types of pricing transparency requirements such as having a code of conduct, as well as reporting remuneration paid to health care professionals or entities in a position to influence prescribing behavior. Violations of these federal and state laws can result in criminal and/or civil punishment, including fines, imprisonment and, in the United States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Greater scrutiny of marketing practices in our industry has resulted in numerous government investigations, prosecutions and settlements by various government authorities and this industry-wide enforcement activity is expected to continue. If a governmental authority were to determine that we do not comply with these laws and regulations, the Company and our directors, officers and employees could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, including exclusion from participation in U.S. federal healthcare reimbursement programs.\nMany of these healthcare laws inevitably influence company standards of conduct. Other laws tie into these standards as well, such as compliance with the advertising and promotion regulations under the FDCA, the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and other laws. We use many distributors and independent sales representatives in certain territories and thus rely upon their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as with the advertising and promotion regulations or similar laws under countries located outside the United States and other applicable federal, state or international laws. These laws include:\n\u25cf the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the U.S. Federal False Claims Act; this may constrain our marketing practices and those of our independent sales agencies, educational programs, pricing, bundling and rebate policies, grants for physician-initiated trials and continuing medical education, and other remunerative relationships with healthcare providers;\n\u25cf federal false claims laws (such as the U.S. Federal False Claims Act) which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims seeking payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal-funded third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; this may impact the reimbursement advice we give to our customers as it cannot be inaccurate and must relate to on-label uses of our products;\n\u25cf federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners. Effective January 2021, we are also required to collect information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives for reporting to CMS in 2022;\n\u25cf analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback prohibitions and false claims prohibitions which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and federal law in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u25cf the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nCertain of these laws have exceptions and \u201csafe harbors\u201d which if met may protect certain arrangements from liability. For example, certain financial payments that might otherwise implicate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be permitted under the state if they are structured to comply with one of various statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors established by the Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These safe harbors include, for example, the \u201cDiscount\u201d safe harbor which allows manufacturers of goods covered by federal payor programs to provide discounts to their customers in the form of rebates, volume discounts and the like as long as those discounts meet the express requirements of the safe harbor. Other safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute may also apply to consulting, teaching and other personal service arrangements we may have with physicians and marketing personnel. These safe harbors are technical in nature and failure to meet any element of a safe harbor will cause an arrangement to lose safe harbor protection. In addition, there may not be safe harbors or exceptions for every potential financial arrangement we may enter into and, and even if there are, no assurances can be given that any of our arrangements or relationships will meet an otherwise applicable safe harbor.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with customers, marketing personnel, physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom have or may have ownership interests in the Company and recommend and/or use our products, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. We are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, and distributors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include, among other infractions or violations, intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates FDA regulations, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data or other commercial or regulatory laws or requirements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nIn addition, state and federal healthcare regulations are constantly evolving. Existing laws and regulations are subject to new and sometimes more restrictive interpretations on a regular basis so that arrangements we believe to be legally compliant could be deemed to be non-compliant under new interpretations. Similarly, new federal and state health care laws and regulations are being adopted on a regular basis. While we endeavor to identify and comply with these new laws and regulations, it is possible that we may be unaware of new legal requirements or interpretations which could result in our violation of these laws and/or regulations.\nThere is also an increasing trend toward more criminal prosecutions and compliance enforcement activities for noncompliance with the HIPAA and state data privacy laws as well as for data breaches involving protected health information (\u201cPHI\u201d). In the ordinary course of our business, we may receive PHI. If we are unable to comply with HIPAA or experience a data breach involving PHI, we could be subject to criminal and civil sanctions and incur substantial investigation, defense and remediation costs.\nIf our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nU.S. governmental regulation could restrict the use of our tissue products or our procurement of tissue.\nIn the United States, the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (\u201cNOTA\u201d), a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including bone and related tissue, for \u201cvaluable consideration.\u201d NOTA permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human bone tissue. We provide services in all of these areas in the United States, with the exception of removal and implantation, and receive payments for all such services. We make payments to certain of our clients and tissue banks for their services related to recovering allograft bone tissue on our behalf. If NOTA is interpreted or enforced in a manner which prevents us from receiving payment for services we render, or which prevents us from paying tissue banks or certain of our clients for the services they render for us, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are engaged through our marketing employees, independent sales agents and sales representatives in ongoing efforts designed to educate the medical community as to the benefits of our products, and we intend to continue our educational activities. Although we believe that NOTA permits payments in connection with these educational efforts as reasonable payments associated with the processing, transportation and implantation of our products, payments in connection with such education efforts are not exempt from NOTA\u2019s restrictions and our inability to make such payments in connection with our education efforts may prevent us from paying our sales representatives for their education efforts and could adversely affect our business and prospects. No federal agency or court has determined whether NOTA is, or will be, applicable to every allograft bone tissue-based material which our processing technologies may generate. Assuming that NOTA applies to our processing of allograft bone tissue, we believe that we comply with NOTA, but there can be no assurance that more restrictive interpretations of, or amendments to, NOTA will not be adopted in the future which would call into question one or more aspects of our method of operations.\nOutside of the United States, our medical devices must comply with the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which they are marketed, and compliance may be costly and time-consuming. Failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in jurisdictions outside the United States will prevent us from marketing our products in such jurisdictions.\nWe currently market, and intend to continue to market, our products outside the United States, with the exception of the EU. To market and sell our product in countries outside the United States, we must seek and obtain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations and comply with the laws and regulations of those countries. These laws and regulations, including the requirements for approvals, certifications or registrations and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. We may not obtain regulatory approvals or certifications outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Clearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations are expensive, and we cannot be certain that we will receive or maintain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any foreign country in which we currently or plan to market our products. For example, during 2020, we ceased selling products in the EU since the cost to maintain our regulatory approvals in the EU exceeded the benefit of doing business there. No assurance can be provided that the costs involved in exiting the EU will not exceed our anticipated costs. In addition, the regulatory approval process outside the United States may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval in addition to other risks.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, including significant changes to a device\u2019s design, materials, chemical composition, energy source, or manufacturing process, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance, a de novo classification, or possibly a PMA. Modifications to our products that were implemented without obtaining clearance or approval and for which FDA subsequently concludes that clearance or approval was required, may require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until clearance or approval is obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. To do that, a manufacturer must determine if a change/modification to labeling of the device is a \u201cmajor\u201d change to the intended use statement (previously cleared by the FDA) or if a physical change/modification to the device itself \u201ccould significantly affect safety or effectiveness.\u201d If the labeling change is major and/or the physical change significantly affects safety and effectiveness, the manufacturer must file for an additional 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA for those changes before the modified device can be lawfully marketed. If the Company concludes in its own self-determination that the changes do not meet either of the thresholds of \u201cmajor \u201cor \u201csignificantly affects,\u201d it may simply document those changes by way of an internal letter-to-file as part of the manufacturer\u2019s quality system recording keeping. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision and may disagree. The FDA will normally review a decision made by a manufacturer in a letter-to-file during a routine plant inspection, which FDA targets to conduct every two years for high-risk (Class III) device manufacturers and certain low and moderate risk (Class I and II) device manufacturers. In such a review the FDA may determine that a new clearance or approval was required before the device was put into commercial distribution.\nWe have made modifications to our products in the past that we concluded did not require a new clearance or approval, and we may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. No assurance can be given that the FDA would agree with any of our decisions not to seek 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval. The issue of whether a product modification requires clearance or approval, as opposed to a \u201cletter-to-file\u201d documenting the change, is not always clear and companies rely on FDA guidance to assist in making such decisions. The FDA revised its guidance regarding when a change to a cleared device requires a new 510(k) clearance in October 2017. This guidance is more burdensome in terms of assessing and documenting whether a new 510(k) should be submitted.\nIf the FDA requires us to cease marketing and recall a modified device until we obtain a new 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA, our business, financial condition, operating results and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Further, our products could be subject to recall if the FDA determines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective. Any recall or FDA requirement that we seek additional approvals or clearances could result in significant delays, fines, increased costs associated with modification of a product, loss of revenue and potential operating restrictions imposed by the FDA. Obtaining clearances and approvals can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nOur manufacturing operations are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s and other governmental authorities\u2019 laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and production of medical devices, which is costly and could subject us to enforcement action.\nWe and certain of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements and Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d), which cover, among other things, the methods of documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process for our products marketed outside of the United States. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced (routine) and unannounced (for cause or directed) inspections of manufacturing facilities. The failure by us or one of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u25cf untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, disgorgement of profits, criminal and civil penalties;\n\u25cf customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval of new products or modified products;\n\u25cf withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo classifications, or PMAs that have already been granted;\n\u25cf refusal to grant export certificates for our products; or\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAny of these actions could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We also may be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future revenue and other operating results. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nEven if our medical device products are cleared or approved by regulatory authorities, if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product that we market will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. Such oversight will cover, among other things, the product\u2019s design and manufacturing processes, our quality system and compliance with reporting requirements, our compliance with post-approval clinical data requirements, and our promotional activities related to our products.\nEven if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, such clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in, among other things, changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, product corrections, removal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, withdrawal of regulatory clearance or approvals, delays in or refusals of new 510(k)s, de novo requests or PMA applications, untitled letters, warning letters, refusal to grant export certificates for our products, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe use, misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business or result in FDA sanctions if we are deemed to have engaged in improper promotion of our products.\nOur products currently marketed in the United States have been cleared through the FDA\u2019s 510(k) process for use under specific circumstances. Our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition on the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. We believe that the specific surgical procedures for which our products are marketed fall within the general intended use of the surgical applications that have been cleared by the FDA. However, the FDA could disagree and require us to stop promoting our products for those specific indications/procedures until we obtain FDA clearance or approval for them. Use of a device outside of its cleared or approved indication is known as \u201coff-label\u201d use. We cannot prevent a surgeon from using our products for off-label use, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional activities, reimbursement advice or training of sales representatives or physicians constitute promotion of an off-label use, the FDA could request that we modify our training or promotional or reimbursement materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including, among other things, the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, disgorgement of profits, a civil fines and criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities also might take action if they consider our promotion or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. For example, the government may take the position that off-label promotion resulted in inappropriate reimbursement for an off-label use in violation of the Federal False Claims Act for which it might impose a civil fine and even pursue criminal action. In those possible events, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products would be impaired. Although we train our sales force not to promote our products for off-label uses, and our instructions for use in all markets specify that our products are not intended for use outside of those indications cleared for use, the FDA or another regulatory agency could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion.\nThere may be increased risk of injury and product liability if surgeons attempt to use our products off-label, misuse our products or do not follow recommended user techniques and guidelines. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among surgeons and patients. Any of these events could harm our business and operating results.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. Under the FDA\u2019s reporting regulations applicable to human cells and tissue and cellular and tissue-based products, we are required to report all adverse reactions involving a communicable disease if it is fatal, life threatening, results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure, or necessitates medical or surgical intervention, including hospitalization. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as mandatory recalls, destruction, cessation of manufacturing, inspection or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results. We are currently subject to certain product liability litigation, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, especially if this litigation requires payments in amounts that exceed our product liability insurance coverage.\nAny future product recall or voluntary market withdrawal of a product due to defects, enhancements and modifications or other reasons would significantly increase our costs.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found or for other reasons. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain recalls undertaken to reduce a risk to health be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. In December 2018, we initiated a Class 2 recall of our Calix Lumbar Spine Implant System. Although there were no device related adverse events reported for this product, and we worked with the FDA on the recall and closed it out in 2019, any future recall announcement could negatively affect our sales and harm our reputation with customers. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or other regulatory authority requirements pertaining to human tissue products, these products could be subject to withdrawal from the market or other enforcement action.\nThe FDA has statutory authority to regulate HCT/Ps. HCT/Ps consist of articles containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient, including allograft-based products. The FDA and other regulatory authorities have been working to establish more comprehensive regulatory frameworks for allograft-based, tissue-containing products, which are frequently derived from cadaveric tissue. Certain of our products are regulated as HCT/Ps and are not marketed pursuant to the FDA\u2019s medical device regulatory authority, and therefore are not subject to FDA clearance or approval. Although we have not obtained premarket approval for these HCT/P products, they are nonetheless subject to regulatory oversight.\nSection 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as 361 HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to: registering facilities and listing products with the FDA; screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility; current Good Tissue Practices, or cGTP, when processing, storing, labeling and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information; stringent recordkeeping; and adverse event reporting. The FDA regulations also have additional requirements that address sub-contracted tissue services, tracking, and donor records review. If a tissue-based product is considered human tissue, the FDA requirements focus on preventing the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases. A product regulated solely as a 361 HCT/P is not required to undergo 510(k) premarket clearance, de novo classification or PMA.\nThe FDA may inspect facilities engaged in manufacturing 361 HCT/Ps and may issue untitled letters, warning letters, or otherwise authorize orders of retention, recall, destruction and cessation of manufacturing if the FDA has reasonable grounds to believe that an HCT/P or the facilities where it is manufactured are in violation of applicable regulations. There also are requirements relating to the import of HCT/Ps that allow the FDA to make a decision as to the HCT/Ps\u2019 admissibility into the United States.\nAn HCT/P is eligible for regulation solely as a 361 HCT/P if it is: (i) minimally manipulated; (ii) intended for homologous use as reflected by labeling, advertising or other indications of the manufacturer\u2019s objective intent; (iii) the manufacture does not involve the combination of the HCT/P with another article, except for water, crystalloids or a sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent (not raising new clinical safety concerns for the HCT/P); and (iv) it does not have a systemic effect and is not dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function or, if it has a systemic effect or is dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function, it is intended for autologous use or allogeneic use in a first or second degree relative or for reproductive use. If any of these requirements are not met, then the HCT/P is also subject to applicable biologic, device, or drug regulation under the FDCA or the PHSA. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to 361 HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics under the PHSA, or devices or drugs under the FDCA, including licensure, clearance or approval.\nOver the course of several years, the FDA issued regulations that address manufacturer activities associated with HCT/Ps. The first requires that companies that manufacture HCT/Ps register with the FDA. This set of regulations also includes the criteria that must be met in order for the HCT/P to be eligible for regulation solely under Section 361 of the PHSA and the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271, rather than under the drug or device provisions of the FDCA or the biological product licensing provisions of the PHSA. The second set of regulations provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the \u201cDonor Eligibility\u201d rule. The third rule governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the \u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices\u201d rule. The \u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practice\u201d rule covers all stages of allograft processing, from procurement of tissue to distribution of final allografts. Together these regulations are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and of communicable disease transmission to recipients.\nAt the time they came into effect approximately 15 years ago, these regulations increased regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate and have led to increased enforcement action which affects the conduct of our business. In addition, these regulations can increase the cost of tissue recovery activities. The FDA periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements. Allegations of violations of applicable regulations noted by the FDA during facility inspections could adversely affect the continued marketing of our products. We believe we comply with all aspects of 21 CFR Part 1271 that we are required to comply with, although there can be no assurance that we will be deemed by FDA to be in compliance. Entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery, donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the Current Good Tissue Practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities. If our suppliers fail to comply with applicable requirements, our products and our business could be negatively affected. If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can impose a variety of enforcement actions from public warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals, seizure of our products, total or partial shutdown of our production, withdrawal of approvals, and criminal prosecutions. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect us.\nIn addition, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion that one or more of our HCT/Ps meet the criteria for marketing solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, and therefore that one or more of the HCT/Ps require licensure, approval or clearance of a marketing application. The FDA could conclude that the tissue is more than minimally manipulated, that the product is intended for a non-homologous use, that the product is combined with another article, or that the product has a systemic effect or is dependent on the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function. The FDA could also determine that a modification to an HCT/P makes it ineligible for regulation solely as a 361 HCT/P. If the FDA were to draw these conclusions, it would likely require the submission and licensure, approval or clearance of a marketing application in order for us to continue to market the product. Such an action by the FDA could cause negative publicity, decreased or discontinued product sales, and significant expense in obtaining required marketing licensure, approval or clearance.\nProcurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation, including allograft tissue we may use in future products, is subject to federal regulation under National Organ Transplant Act. NOTA prohibits the acquisition, receipt, or other transfer of certain human organs, including bone and other human tissue, for valuable consideration within the meaning of NOTA. NOTA permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human organs. For any future products implicating NOTA\u2019s requirements, we would reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue that they would provide to us. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we may recover in our pricing for our services, thereby negatively impacting our future revenue and profitability. If we were to be found to have violated NOTA\u2019s prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we would potentially be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Further, in the future, if NOTA is amended or reinterpreted, we may not be able to pass these expenses on to our customers and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected.\nOther regulatory entities with authority over our products and operations include state agencies enforcing statutes and regulations covering tissue banking. Regulations issued by Florida, New York, California and Maryland are particularly relevant to our business. Most states do not currently have tissue banking regulations. It is possible that others may make allegations against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks about non-compliance with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes or regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action or could cause negative publicity for our business and the industry in which we operate.\nLoss of AATB accreditation would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are accredited with the American Association of Tissue Banks, a private non-profit organization that accredits tissue banks and sets industry standards. Although AATB accreditation is voluntary and not required by law, as a practical matter, many of our customers would not purchase our products if we failed to maintain our AATB accreditation. Although we make every effort to maintain our AATB accreditation, the accreditation process is somewhat subjective and lacks regulatory oversight. There can be no assurance that we will continue to remain accredited with the AATB and any loss of our AATB accreditation would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFederal regulatory reforms may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and our business.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFor example, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and our business.\nProduct pricing is subject to regulatory control, which could impact our revenue and other operating results.\nThe pricing of our products may become subject to control by the government and other third-party payors. The continuing efforts of governmental and other third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means may adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products. In most foreign markets, the pricing of certain diagnostics and prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control, though it is unclear which proposals will ultimately become law, if any. Changes in prices, including any mandated pricing, could impact our revenue and other operating results.\nOur revenues depend upon prompt and adequate coverage and reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry, including the medical device industry, in the United States to fundamental change. The ability of healthcare providers to purchase our products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such materials and related treatments is and will continue to be available from governmental health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations. In the United States, healthcare providers who purchase our products generally rely on these third-party payors to pay for all or a portion of the cost of our products as a component of a single bundled payment amount for the procedures in which the products are used. Because there is often no separate third-party payor reimbursement to the provider for our products, the additional cost associated with purchasing our products can impact the provider\u2019s profit margin for delivering the treatment that includes are product as a component. If third-party payor reimbursement to providers for procedures involving our products is eliminated or reduced, some of our target customers may be unwilling to purchase our products and may choose to instead purchase less expensive alternatives from our competitors. In addition, third-party payors for hospital services and hospital outpatient services, including Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurers, typically revise their coverage and payment policies, methodologies and amounts on an annual basis, which can result in noncoverage, stricter standards for reimbursement of hospital charges for certain medical procedures or the elimination of or reduction in reimbursement. Further, Medicare, Medicaid and private healthcare insurer cutbacks could create downward price pressure on our products. Healthcare reform legislation at the federal and state levels could result in changes in coverage of and reimbursement for our products. Finally, our revenues also depend upon timely reimbursement data input from our independent agents. All of these factors could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties\nSubstantially all of our revenue is conducted through independent distributors and sales agents who we do not control.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is conducted through distributors and independent sales agents. Because the independent distributor often controls the customer relationships within its territory (and, in certain countries outside the United States, the regulatory relationship), there is a risk that if our relationship with the distributor ends, our relationship with the customer will be lost (and, in certain countries outside the United States, that we could experience delays in amending or transferring our product registrations). Also, because we do not control the field sales agents of a distributor or independent sales agent, there is a risk we will be unable to ensure that our sales processes, compliance, and other priorities will be consistently communicated and executed by the distributor or sales agent. If we fail to maintain relationships with our key distributors and independent sales representatives or fail to ensure that our distributors and independent sales agent adhere to our sales processes, compliance, and other priorities, this could have an adverse effect on our operations. Changes to or turnover within our independent distributor and independent sales agent organization or transitions to direct selling models also could adversely affect our business if these transitions are not managed effectively. Further, independent distributors and sales agents of companies we have acquired may decide not to renew or may decide to seek to terminate, change and/or renegotiate their relationships with us. A loss of a significant number of our distributors or agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, our success is partially dependent upon our ability to retain and motivate our distributors, independent sales agencies, and their representatives to sell our products in certain territories. They may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans. Some of our distributors and independent sales agencies do not sell our products exclusively and may offer similar products from other companies. Our distributors and independent sales agencies may terminate their contracts with us, may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products, or may focus their sales efforts on other products that produce greater commissions for them, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and operating results.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for products, components and raw materials and losing any of these suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of materials that meet our quality and other requirements or our failure to order a sufficient supply of products, components and raw materials, could harm our business and operating results.\nOutside suppliers, some of whom are sole-source suppliers, provide us with products and raw materials and components used in manufacturing our orthobiologics and spinal implant products. We strive to maintain sufficient inventory of products, raw materials and components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted if a particular product, raw material or component is not available to us for a period of time, including as a result of a supplier\u2019s loss of its ISO or other certification, long required lead times, or other reasons. Despite our efforts, we sometimes experience an insufficient inventory of products, raw materials and/or components. At the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020, we experienced a supply issue with certain of our biologics and hardware products. If we fail to plan our procurement accordingly or are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and components used in manufacturing our orthobiologics and spinal implant products that meet our quality and other requirements on a timely basis for any reason, we may not produce sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand until a new or alternative supply source is identified and qualified and, as a result, we could lose customers, our reputation could be harmed and our business could suffer. Furthermore, an uncorrected defect or supplier\u2019s variation in a component or raw material that is incompatible with our manufacturing, unknown to us, could harm our ability to manufacture products.\nAlthough we believe there are alternative supply sources, replacing our suppliers may be impractical or difficult in many instances. For example, we could have difficulty obtaining similar products from other suppliers that are acceptable to the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, if we are required to transition to new suppliers for certain components or raw materials of our products, the use of components or materials furnished by these alternative suppliers could require us to alter our operations, and if we are required to change the manufacturer of a critical component of our products, we will have to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality and applicable regulatory requirements, which could further impede our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner. Transitioning to a new supplier could be time-consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our operations and product delivery, could affect the performance specifications of our products or could require that we modify the design of those systems.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Management\nWe have limited staffing and are dependent upon key employees. In addition, our business is dependent upon a sufficient number of qualified workers and competition for such talent is intense, especially around Belgrade, Montana, where the population is small and the labor market is tight. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or if we must increase substantially our labor costs to attract and retain qualified personnel, the growth and success of our business, as well as our operating results and financial condition, may be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent upon the efforts of a relatively small management team and staff. We have experienced a high level of employee turnover in past years, including members of our management team. We have employment arrangements in place with our executive and other officers, but none of these executive and other officers are bound legally to remain employed with Xtant for any specific term. We do not have key person life insurance policies covering our executive and other officers or any of our other employees. If key individuals were to leave Xtant, our business could be affected adversely if suitable replacement personnel are not recruited quickly.\nThe population around Belgrade, Montana, where our headquarters and production facilities are located, is small, and as a result, there is a limited number of qualified personnel available in all functional areas, which has made it difficult for us to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development and growth of our business. Our ability to maintain our productivity at competitive levels and increase production in the future may be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain personnel necessary to meet our requirements. Companies in our industry, including us, are dependent upon an available labor pool of qualified employees. We compete for qualified personnel with other companies, academic institutions, governmental entities, and other organizations. A shortage in the labor pool of workers, which we believe currently exists in Belgrade, Montana, has made it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate qualified labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy and operations. A tight labor market in the Belgrade, Montana area also has required us to enhance our wages and benefit packages to attract a sufficient number of workers, and it is possible that these increased labor costs may not be effective in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or if we must increase substantially our labor costs to attract and retain qualified personnel, the growth and success of our business, as well as our operating results and financial condition, will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we lose any future intellectual property lawsuits, a court could require us to pay significant damages or prevent us from selling our products.\nThe medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Legal proceedings, regardless of the outcome, could drain our financial resources and divert the time and effort of our management. If we lose this litigation or any other similar legal proceedings of which we may become subject, a court could require us to pay significant damages to third parties, indemnify third parties from loss, require us to seek licenses from third parties, pay ongoing royalties, redesign our products, or prevent us from manufacturing, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing our products. While we do not believe that any of our products infringe any valid claims of patents or other proprietary rights held by others, we are currently subject to a patent infringement claim and were recently subject to patent infringement litigation which we settled in February 2020. There can be no assurances that we do not infringe any patents or other proprietary rights. In November 2020, we received a letter from a third party\u2019s legal counsel claiming that some of our products, including the Butrex Plating System, Spider Plating System, Aranax Plating System and Irix Fusion System, infringe a patent held by the third party and offering to discuss settlement terms. Because this matter is in early stages and because of the complexity of the claims, we cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with its resolution. However, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition to being costly, protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.\nIf our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nWe rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements, and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not completely protect our rights. For example, competitors may be able to design around some of our intellectual property rights to develop competing but non-infringing technologies. In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will issue. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or an applicable foreign intellectual property office) may deny or require a significant narrowing of the claims in its pending patent applications and the patents issuing from such applications. Any patents issuing from pending patent applications may not provide us with significant commercial protection or sufficient commercial protection to prevent competitors from utilizing similar but non-infringing technologies. We could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws or at all. We also may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries. Additionally, patents and certain other intellectual property rights are not perpetual, and third parties will be able to utilize the subject rights upon expiration.\nIn addition, we hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products. The loss of such licenses could prevent us from manufacturing, marketing, and selling these products, which could harm our business. If we, or the other parties from whom we would license intellectual property, fail to obtain and maintain adequate patent or other intellectual property protection for intellectual property used in our products, or if any protection is reduced or eliminated, others could use the intellectual property used in our products, resulting in harm to our competitive business position.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary technology, in part, with confidentiality agreements with our employees, independent distributors, and consultants. We cannot be assured, however, that the agreements will not be breached, adequate remedies for any breach would be available, or our trade secrets, know-how, and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors.\nWe may not be able to obtain or protect our proprietary rights relating to our products without resorting to costly and time-consuming litigation.\nWe may not be able to obtain, maintain and protect certain proprietary rights necessary for the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection on our products, successfully asserting these patents against competitors employing infringing technology, and successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Even if our patents cover a competing technology, a competitor may not accede to our demands to cease and desist or license our patent rights, which will then require us to pursue costly and time-consuming litigation. Even if we were successful in any such litigation, a court may not issue an injunction, or the infringing competitor may alter its technology to no longer infringe. Our ability to commercialize our products will also depend in part on the patent positions of third parties, including those of our competitors. The patent positions of medical device and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the scope and breadth of patent claims that may be afforded to other companies\u2019 patents. We could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties, or if we initiate suits to protect our patent rights. Such suits that we may need to defend extend beyond suits by our competitors and may include patent assertion entities, which acquire and assert patents as a means to generate income, due to the expensive nature of patent litigation. In the ordinary course of litigation, attorney fees are not recoverable.\nIn addition to the risks involved with patent protection, we also face the risk that our competitors will infringe on our trademarks. Any infringement could lead to a likelihood of confusion and could result in lost sales. Similarly, while we are cautious to avoid infringing the rights of third parties, we cannot control a third party asserting its trademarks against us. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any claims we make to protect our intellectual property, or in defense of any claims brought against us.\nFuture protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain which may impact our ability to successfully compete in our industry. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. We cannot ensure that:\n\u25cf we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patent applications;\n\u25cf we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u25cf any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u25cf any of our issued patents or those of our licensors will be valid and enforceable;\n\u25cf any patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products or will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf any of our patent or other intellectual property rights in the U.S. and the technologies embodied therein will provide or be subject to similar or any protection in foreign markets;\n\u25cf we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on our business rights; or\n\u25cf the measures we rely on to protect the intellectual property underlying our products will be adequate to prevent third parties from using our technology, all of which could harm our ability to compete in the market.\nRisks Related to Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Protection\nWe are dependent on various information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems, and failures of, interruptions to, or unauthorized tampering with those systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on IT systems to conduct business. Our reliance on IT systems increased as work from home arrangements were necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These systems include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, invoicing and shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business. In addition, we have grown in part through strategic business combinations and acquisitions. As a result of these transactions, we may face risks due to implementation, modification, or remediation of the IT controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired businesses.\nIn addition, if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate for this on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our customers, suppliers, independent sales agents, distributors and third-party service providers, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of any underlying information and data. Work from home arrangements may increase cybersecurity risks related to phishing, malware, and other similar cybersecurity attacks. We have programs, processes and technologies in place to prevent, detect, contain, respond to and mitigate security related threats and potential incidents. We undertake considerable ongoing improvements to our IT systems in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and can be difficult to detect, anticipating, identifying or preventing these intrusions or mitigating them if and when they occur may be challenging. Our IT systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards. We also outsource certain elements of our IT systems to third parties that, as a result of this outsourcing, could have access to certain confidential information and whose systems may also be vulnerable to these types of attacks or disruptions. There can be no assurance that our protective measures or those of these third parties will prevent or detect security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. The failure of these systems to operate or integrate effectively with other internal, customer, supplier or third-party service provider systems and to protect the underlying IT system and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches or unauthorized access of these systems, or any failure by us to remediate any such attacks or breaches, may also result in damage to our reputation or competitiveness, delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems.\nOur current enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system is substantially outdated and in need of a substantial upgrade or conversion to a new ERP system.\nAlthough we recently made upgrades to our ERP system, it is still substantially outdated and in need of significant additional upgrades or conversion to a new ERP system. Implementing new or upgraded systems carries substantial risk, including failure to operate as designed, failure to properly integrate with our systems, potential loss of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, and disruption of operations. Third-party vendors are also relied upon to design, program, maintain, and service the ERP system. Any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our ERP system implementation plan could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate, or inaccessible. We may experience difficulties in our business operations, or difficulties in operating our business under these systems, either of which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely invoice customers, ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, effectively manage customer accounts receivable and pay suppliers within terms and otherwise adequately service our customers, and could lead to increased costs and other difficulties. In the event we experience significant disruptions as a result of the implementation or upgrade of new systems or otherwise, we may not be able to fix our systems in an efficient and timely manner. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate should all or part of the ERP system upgrade implementation process prove to be ineffective. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operations and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Controlled Company Status\nFunds affiliated with OrbiMed own a significant percentage of our common stock, have the right to designate a majority of our Board of Directors, and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval, preventing other stockholders and new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nROS and Royalty Opportunities collectively owned approximately 93.9% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. Royalty Opportunities is also the lender under our Second A&R Credit Agreement and holds all of the outstanding indebtedness thereunder.\nIn addition, we are party to an Investor Rights Agreement with Royalty Opportunities and ROS under which they are permitted to nominate a majority of the directors and designate the chairperson of our Board of Directors at subsequent annual meetings, as long as they maintain an ownership threshold in our Company of at least 40% of our then outstanding common stock. If ROS and Royalty Opportunities are unable to maintain this ownership threshold, the Investor Rights Agreement contemplates a reduction of nomination rights commensurate with their ownership interests. In addition, under the Investor Rights Agreement, for so long as the ownership threshold is met, we must obtain the approval of a majority of our common stock held by ROS and Royalty Opportunities to proceed with the following actions: (i) issue new securities; (ii) incur over $250,000 of debt in a fiscal year; (iii) sell or transfer over $250,000 of our assets or businesses or our subsidiaries in a fiscal year; (iv) acquire over $250,000 of assets or properties in a fiscal year; (v) make capital expenditures over $125,000 individually, or $1,500,000 in the aggregate during a fiscal year; (vi) approve our annual budget; (vii) hire or terminate our chief executive officer; (viii) appoint or remove the chairperson of our Board of Directors; and (ix) make loans to, investments in, or purchase, or permit any subsidiary to purchase, any stock or other securities in another entity in excess of $250,000 in a fiscal year. As long as the ownership threshold is met, we may not increase the size of our Board of Directors beyond seven directors without the approval of a majority of the directors nominated by ROS and Royalty Opportunities. The Investor Rights Agreement also grants Royalty Opportunities and ROS the right to purchase from us a pro rata amount of any new securities that we may propose to issue and sell.\nBecause of their significant share ownership and control, OrbiMed has the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders and Board of Directors, including amendments to our Charter, Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d), election and removal of directors, the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of indebtedness by us, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions, as well as certain day-to-day decisions involved in operating our business, such as annual operating plans, capital expenditures and other investments in our business. The interests of OrbiMed may not necessarily in all cases be aligned with management\u2019s views on the operation of our business or the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, OrbiMed and their affiliates may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions or not pursuing such transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance or reduce their investment or position as our creditor, even though such transactions might involve risks to our other stockholders. For example, OrbiMed could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets. In addition, OrbiMed and their affiliates are able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval and are able to cause or prevent a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors and could preclude any acquisition of our Company. This concentration of voting control could deprive our other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE American rules and rely on exemptions from various corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide because more than 50% of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by OrbiMed Advisors LLC. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are exempt from certain NYSE American rules requiring our Board of Directors to have a majority of independent members, a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors. These independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet those standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We rely on NYSE American\u2019s controlled company exemptions and do not have a majority of independent directors on the Board of Directors, an independent nomination and governance committee or an independent compensation committee. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American rules.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nShares of our common stock are equity securities and are subordinate to our outstanding indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock are common equity interests. This means that our common stock will rank junior to any outstanding shares of our preferred stock that we may issue in the future or to the indebtedness under our Second A&R Credit Agreement and any future indebtedness we may incur and to all creditor claims and other non-equity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims on us, including claims in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of our common stock, (i) dividends are payable only when and if declared by our Board of Directors, and (ii) as a corporation, we are restricted to making dividend payments and redemption payments out of legally available assets. We have never paid a dividend on our common stock and have no current intention to pay dividends in the future. In addition, our Second A&R Credit Agreement precludes us from paying dividends. Furthermore, our common stock places no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions, subject only to the voting rights available to stockholders generally.\nOur inability to comply with the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American could result in our common stock being delisted, which could affect its market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital.\nWe are required to meet certain qualitative and financial tests to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American. If we do not maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements for the NYSE American within specified periods and subject to permitted extensions, our common stock may be recommended for delisting (subject to any appeal we would file). On October 5, 2020, we regained compliance with these continued listing requirements as a result of the completion of our recent debt restructuring. No assurance can be provided that we will continue to comply with these continued listing requirements. If our common stock were delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell our common stock and to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting would also impair our ability to raise capital.\nThe market price of our common stock is extremely volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital in the future and may subject the value of the investment of our stockholders to sudden decreases.\nThe market price for securities of medical device and biotechnology companies, including ours, historically has been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. The trading volume and prices of our common stock have been and may continue to be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors both within and beyond our control. During 2020, the sale price of our common stock ranged from $0.55 to $3.50 per share, and our daily trading volume ranged from zero to 112.3 million shares. Such volatility may be the result of broad market and industry factors. Future fluctuations in the trading price or liquidity of our common stock may harm the value of the investment of our stockholders in our common stock. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price and marketability of our common stock include, among others:\n\u25cf the terms of any potential future transaction(s) related to debt financing, debt restructuring or capital raising;\n\u25cf our ability to make interest payments under our Second A&R Credit Agreement;\n\u25cf our observance of covenants under our Second A&R Credit Agreement;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our present or potential competitors;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf developments in our relationships with employees, suppliers, distributors, sales representatives and customers;\n\u25cf acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u25cf litigation and government proceedings;\n\u25cf adverse legislation, including changes in governmental regulation;\n\u25cf third-party reimbursement policies;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our equity securities by our significant stockholders or management or sales of additional equity securities by our Company;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 recommendations;\n\u25cf short selling;\n\u25cf changes in health care policies and practices;\n\u25cf the delisting of our common stock or halting or suspension of trading in our common stock by the NYSE American;\n\u25cf economic, social and other external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u25cf general market conditions.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. These lawsuits often seek unspecified damages, and as with any litigation proceeding, one cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending litigation. Furthermore, we may have to incur substantial expenses in connection with any such lawsuits and our management\u2019s attention and resources could be diverted from operating our business as we respond to any such litigation. We maintain insurance to cover these risks for us and our directors and officers, but our insurance is subject to high deductibles to reduce premium expense, and there is no guarantee that the insurance will cover any specific claim that we currently face or may face in the future, or that it will be adequate to cover all potential liabilities and damages.\nWe may issue additional common stock resulting in stock ownership dilution.\nFuture dilution may occur due to additional future equity issuances and/or equity financing events by us, including any potential future restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we may raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, which would further dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding warrants to purchase approximately 421,278 shares of our common stock, stock options to purchase 2,176,272 shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit awards covering 2,503,698 shares of our common stock under the Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, options to purchase 14,620 shares of our common stock under our prior equity compensation plan, and 3,507,165 shares available for issuance under the Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. If these or any future warrants, options or restricted stock units are exercised or otherwise converted into shares of our common stock, our stockholders will experience additional dilution.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or other equity securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock or a preferred stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through equity offerings in the future. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities beneficially owned by OrbiMed or any other stockholder or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and agreements may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the Company could be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nSeveral provisions of our Charter and Bylaws and our Investor Rights Agreement could make it difficult for our stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors, preventing them from changing the composition of management. In addition, several provisions of our Charter and Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u25cf We have shares of common stock and preferred stock available for issuance without stockholder approval. The existence of unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock may enable the Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred stock with terms that could render more difficult or discourage a third-party attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, thereby protecting the continuity of our management.\n\u25cf Shares of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, so our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding will be able to elect all of our directors.\n\u25cf Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the Board or the chief executive officer.\n\u25cf The Board of Directors may adopt, alter, amend or repeal our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws without stockholder approval.\n\u25cf Unless otherwise provided by law, any newly created directorship or any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors for any cause may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining members of the Board even if such majority is less than a quorum, and any director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he or she has replaced or until his or her successor is elected and qualified.\n\u25cf The affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required to amend or repeal the provisions of our Charter related to the amendment of our Bylaws, the Board of Directors and our stockholders as well as the general provisions of our Charter.\n\u25cf Stockholders must follow advance notice procedures to submit nominations of candidates for election to the Board of Directors at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and must follow advance notice procedures to submit other proposals for business to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders.\n\u25cf Unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of Xtant to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising under any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our Charter or our Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\n\u25cf The Investor Rights Agreement includes director nomination rights, which provide that so long as the Ownership Threshold (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) is met, Royalty Opportunities and ROS are entitled to nominate such individuals to the Board of Directors constituting a majority of the directors. In addition, under the Investor Rights Agreement, so long as the Ownership Threshold is met, certain matters require the approval of Royalty Opportunities and ROS to proceed with such a transaction, including without limitation, the sale, transfer or other disposition of assets or business of the Company or its subsidiaries with a value in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate during any fiscal year (other than sales of inventory or supplies in the ordinary course of business, sales of obsolete assets (excluding real estate), sale-leaseback transactions and accounts receivable factoring transactions).\nThese anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of our stockholders to benefit from a change in control and, as a result, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to realize any potential change-in-control premium.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur Charter authorizes our Board of Directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue up to 10 million shares of our preferred stock, subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules and regulations and the provisions of our Charter, as shares of preferred stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers, preferences and rights of these series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with our common stock, which may reduce its value.\nOur Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur Charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, or other employees, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Stockholders in our Company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our Charter related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our Charter may limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nWe have never paid dividends and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. The payment of dividends in the future will be dependent on our earnings and financial condition and on such other factors as our Board of Directors considers appropriate. Unless and until we pay dividends, stockholders may not receive a return on their shares of our common stock. There is no present intention by our Board of Directors to pay dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of our Second A&R Credit Agreement preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, appreciation, if any, in the market price of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWorldwide economic and social instability could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe health of the global economy, and the credit markets and the financial services industry in particular, as well as the stability of the social fabric of our society, affects our business and operating results. For example, if the credit markets are not favorable, we may be unable to raise additional financing when needed or on favorable terms. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any economic crisis, such as the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could also adversely impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with materials and components, which may negatively impact our business. As with our customers and vendors, these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, or assumptions utilized in determining accounting estimates could adversely affect our financial statements, including our operating results and financial condition.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we must make decisions that impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial valuations, as appropriate. As a result, actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Our critical accounting estimates are described later in this report under Part II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, various authoritative accounting or regulatory entities, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), and the SEC may amend, expand, and/or eliminate the financial accounting or reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or could reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various financial accounting and/or reporting standards should be applied. We disclose the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet adopted within our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. However, we do not provide an assessment of proposed accounting pronouncements, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore, we cannot meaningfully assess their effects on our consolidated financial statements. Future changes to accounting standards could modify the accounting policies and procedures that are currently utilized in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Such changes may be difficult to predict and implement and could materially, or otherwise, impact how we prepare and report our consolidated financial statements, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the NYSE American, may strain our resources, increase our costs and divert management\u2019s attention, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the corporate governance standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the NYSE American. These requirements place a strain on our management, systems and resources and we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses. The Exchange Act requires us to file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition within specified time periods and to prepare a proxy statement with respect to our annual meeting of stockholders. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. The NYSE American requires that we comply with various corporate governance requirements. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and comply with the Exchange Act and NYSE American requirements, significant resources and management oversight are required. This may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and lead to significant costs associated with compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on us and the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, as we grow our business both organically and through acquisitions, our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will become more complex, and we may require significantly more resources to ensure that these controls and procedures remain effective.\nThese laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors or its committees or as our executive officers. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt even more changes in governance and reporting requirements. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of these costs. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.", "PERMNO": 12592, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "XTNT"}
