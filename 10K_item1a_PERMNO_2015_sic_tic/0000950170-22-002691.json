Risk Factors\nAs described in Part I (\u201cDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d), this report contains forward-looking statements regarding us, our business and our industry. The risk factors described below, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements. The risk factors described below are not the only risks we face.

common stock may be volatile; and\n\u2022The impact of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\u2019s forum selection clause on certain types of actions and proceedings.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of shares of Enerflex common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, Exterran stockholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will receive in the Merger prior to the closing of the Merger.\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each share of Exterran common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain excluded shares as described in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive 1.021 Enerflex common shares. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the value of the merger consideration will depend on the market price of Enerflex common shares at the effective time. The market price of Enerflex common shares has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Merger Agreement and is expected to continue to fluctuate until the closing date, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the date hereof. Changes in the price of Enerflex common shares may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in Enerflex\u2019s and Exterran\u2019s respective businesses, operations and prospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood that the proposed acquisition will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the proposed acquisition and changes with respect to expectations regarding the timing of the proposed acquisition and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond Exterran\u2019s control.\nUpon completion of the merger, Exterran stockholders will become Enerflex shareholders, and the market price for Enerflex common shares may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected Exterran.\nUpon completion of the Merger, Exterran stockholders will become Enerflex shareholders. Enerflex\u2019s businesses differ from those of Exterran, and accordingly, the results of operations of Enerflex will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of Exterran.\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder/shareholder approvals as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\nClosing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the Merger. These conditions include, among other things: (1) receipt of the Exterran stockholder approval; (2) receipt of the Enerflex shareholder approval; (3) effectiveness of the Form in accordance with the provisions of the U.S. Securities Act and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form having been issued and remaining in effect and no proceeding to that effect having been commenced; (4) the absence of any injunction or similar order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger; (5) approval of applicable antitrust authorities; (6) the Enerflex common shares issuable in the merger having been approved for listing on the NYSE or Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, and the TSX, subject to customary listing requirements; (7) the accuracy of each party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement; (8) compliance by each party in all material respects with such party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement; and (9) with respect to Enerflex, the\nabsence of a Company Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to Exterran, the absence of a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement).\nThe governmental authorities from which authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings or otherwise seek to prevent the Merger. As a condition to authorization of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, these governmental authorities also may impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of Enerflex\u2019s business after the combination of Enerflex and Exterran following receipt of final antitrust approval.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we cannot provide any assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within Exterran\u2019s control, and Exterran cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the Merger could cause Exterran not to realize some or all of the benefits that it expects to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within the expected timeframe.\nIn order to complete the Merger, Enerflex and Exterran must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the Merger may be delayed, jeopardized or prevented and the anticipated benefits of the Merger could be reduced.\nNo assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied. Even if all such consents, orders and approvals are obtained and such conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents, orders and approvals. For example, these consents, orders and approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to the divisions, operations or assets of Exterran and Enerflex or may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of Exterran\u2019s or Enerflex\u2019s business, and if such consents, orders and approvals require an extended period of time to be obtained, such extended period of time could increase the chance that an adverse event occurs with respect to Exterran or Enerflex. Such extended period of time also may increase the chance that other adverse effects with respect to Exterran or Enerflex could occur, such as the loss of key personnel. Even if all necessary approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals.\nThe Exterran special meeting may take place before all of the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before all conditions to such approvals, if any, are known. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Exterran Merger proposal is approved by Exterran stockholders, Exterran may not be required to seek further approval of Exterran stockholders.\nAfter Enerflex\u2019s combination with Exterran, Enerflex may fail to realize projected benefits and cost savings of the combination, which could adversely affect the value of Enerflex common shares.\nEnerflex and Exterran have operated and, pending closing of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. The success of Enerflex\u2019s combination with Exterran will depend, in part, on Enerflex\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining the businesses of Exterran and Enerflex following the Merger, including operational and other synergies that we believe the combined company will achieve. The anticipated benefits and synergies of Enerflex\u2019s combination with Exterran may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as the achievement of operating synergies, may not be realized. The integration process may, for Exterran and Enerflex, result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. There could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Merger that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence. Coordinating certain aspects of the operations and\npersonnel of Enerflex with Exterran after the combination of Enerflex and Exterran will involve complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges, which may be made more difficult in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the integration will require significant time and focus from management following the combination which may disrupt the business of the combined company.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with its existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the Merger. We could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. The attention of our management may be directed towards closing the Merger, including obtaining required approvals and other transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of Exterran and matters related to the Merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to Exterran. Additionally, the Merger Agreement requires each party to obtain the other party\u2019s consent prior to taking certain specified actions while the transaction is pending. These restrictions may prevent Exterran from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities prior to the closing of the Merger. Any of these matters could adversely affect the business of, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of Exterran or the combined company and thus the market value of Enerflex common shares.\nIf the Merger does not close, the price of Exterran common stock may fall to the extent that the current price of Exterran common stock reflect a market assumption that the Merger will close. In addition, the failure to close the Merger may result in negative publicity or a negative impression of Exterran in the investment community and may affect Exterran\u2019s relationship with employees, customers, suppliers and other partners in the business community.\nWe will incur substantial fees and costs in connection with the Merger Agreement and the Merger.\nExterran has incurred and expects to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including costs relating to obtaining required approvals and compensation payments to its executives triggered by the change in control of Exterran as a result of the Merger. Exterran has incurred significant financial services, accounting, tax and legal fees in connection with the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the transaction. Additional significant unanticipated costs may be incurred in the course of coordinating and combining the business of Exterran. Even if the Merger does not close, Exterran will need to pay certain costs relating to the transaction incurred prior to the date the Merger was abandoned, such as financial advisory, accounting, tax, legal, filing and printing fees. Such costs may be significant and could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition to its own fees and expenses, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Exterran will be required to pay to Enerflex a $10.0 million termination payment. In addition to its own fees and expenses, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Enerflex may be required to pay either $20.0 million or $30.0 million to Exterran, depending on the reason for the termination.\nWhile the transaction is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial position and/or cash flows or result in a loss of employees, suppliers, vendors or customers.\nThe Merger Agreement generally requires Exterran to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course prior to the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the closing date. In addition, the\nMerger Agreement includes a variety of specified restrictions on the conduct of Exterran\u2019s business, which, in the event the Merger Agreement is not earlier terminated, expire on the closing date. Among other things and subject to the other terms of the Merger Agreement and certain other exceptions and limitations, Exterran may not, outside of the ordinary course of business, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of Exterran\u2019s common stock outside of its equity incentive plans, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, acquire assets, securities or property, dispose of businesses or assets, enter into certain material contracts or make certain additional capital expenditures. Exterran may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the Merger Agreement delay or prevent Exterran from making certain changes, or limit its ability to make certain changes, during such period, even if Exterran\u2019s management believes that making certain changes may be advisable. The pendency of the transaction may also divert management\u2019s attention and Exterran\u2019s resources from ongoing business and operations.\nExterran\u2019s employees, suppliers, vendors or customers may experience uncertainties about the effects of the Merger. It is possible that some employees, suppliers, vendors or customers and other parties with whom Exterran has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with Exterran as a result of the proposed acquisition. Similarly, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Exterran following completion of the Merger, which may materially and adversely affect Exterran\u2019s ability to attract and retain key employees. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact Exterran\u2019s operating results, financial position, cash flows and/or stock price.\nFailure by Exterran to successfully execute its business strategy and objectives may materially adversely affect the future results of the combined company and, consequently, the market value of Enerflex common shares.\nThe success of the combination of Enerflex and Exterran will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. Furthermore, our business strategy, operations and plans for growth rely significantly on agreements with third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic alliances. Our ability to provide service to its customers depends in large part upon its ability to maintain these agreements with third parties, and upon the performance of the obligations under the agreements by the third parties. The termination of, or the failure to renew, these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements and interfere with its business strategy, operations and plans for growth. If we are not able to achieve our business strategy, are not able to achieve our business strategy on a timely basis, or otherwise fail to perform in accordance with Enerflex\u2019s expectations, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, and the combination may materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the combined company and, consequently, the market value of Enerflex common shares.\nFailure to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the price of Exterran common stock, and future business and financial results.\nIf the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of Exterran common stock, and from Exterran\u2019s employees, suppliers, vendors, regulators or customers;\n\u2022We may, in certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, be required to pay Enerflex a termination payment of $10.0 million, in consideration for the disposition by Enerflex of its contractual rights under the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022The Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of Enerflex, may prevent us from making certain material acquisitions, entering into or amending certain contracts, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the transaction or, with respect to certain actions, prior to the control date, that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and\n\u2022Matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIn addition, Exterran could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce Exterran\u2019s performance obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nIf any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nDirectors and executive officers of Exterran have interests in the transaction that may differ from the interests of Exterran stockholders generally, including, if the Merger is completed, the receipt of financial and other benefits.\nExterran stockholders should be aware that Exterran\u2019s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Exterran stockholders generally. These interests may include, among others, the treatment of outstanding Exterran equity awards under the Merger Agreement, the potential payment of severance benefits and acceleration of outstanding Exterran equity awards upon certain terminations of employment, retention awards and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage.\nExcept in specified circumstances, if the effective time has not occurred by the end date, either Exterran or Enerflex may choose not to proceed with the transaction.\nEither Exterran or Enerflex may terminate the Merger Agreement if the effective time has not occurred by October 24, 2022 (i.e., the end date); provided, that to the extent the condition to obtain the antitrust authorizations required to be obtained with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has not been satisfied or waived on or prior to October 24, 2022, but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing), the end date will be automatically extended 30 days. However, this right to terminate the Merger Agreement will not be available to Exterran or Enerflex if such party has breached in any material respect its obligations under the Merger Agreement in any manner that has been the primary cause of the failure to consummate the Merger on or before the end date.\nCurrent Exterran stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transaction and will exercise less influence over the management of the combined company.\nHolders of Exterran common stock currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting Exterran. In the Merger, each holder of Exterran common stock who receives Enerflex common shares will become a holder of common share of the combined company, with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than the holder\u2019s percentage ownership of Exterran. Following the completion of the Merger, the former holders of Exterran common stock are estimated to own approximately twenty-seven and one half percent (27.5%) of the fully diluted shares of the combined company immediately after the Merger and current holders of Enerflex common shares as a group are estimated to own approximately seventy-two and one half percent (72.5%) of the fully diluted shares of the combined company immediately after the Merger. Consequently, current Enerflex shareholders in the aggregate will have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have over the management and policies of Enerflex, and Exterran stockholders in the aggregate will have significantly less influence over the management and policies of the combined company than they currently have over the management and policies of Exterran.\nExterran and Enerflex may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into transaction agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe combined company may be exposed to increased litigation from stockholders, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties due to the combination of Enerflex\u2019s business and Exterran\u2019s business. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations or may cause disruptions to the combined company\u2019s operations.\nEnerflex and Exterran may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the combination of Enerflex and Exterran.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on Enerflex and Exterran employees may have an adverse effect on each of Enerflex and Exterran separately and consequently the combined company. This uncertainty may impair Enerflex\u2019s and/or Exterran\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as employees of Enerflex and Exterran may experience uncertainty about their future roles in the combined company.\nAdditionally, Exterran\u2019s officers and employees may hold shares of Exterran common stock, and, if the Merger closes, these officers and employees may be entitled to the merger consideration in respect of such shares of Exterran common stock. Under agreements between Exterran and certain of its key employees, such employees could potentially resign from employment on or after the effective time following specified circumstances constituting good reason or constructive termination (as set forth in the applicable agreement) that could result in severance payments to such employees and accelerated vesting of their equity awards. These payments and accelerated vesting benefits, individually or in the aggregate, could make retention of Exterran key employees more difficult.\nFurthermore, if key employees of Enerflex or Exterran depart or are at risk of departing, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined company, Enerflex may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent, and the combined company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger may be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent that Enerflex and Exterran have been able to attract or retain employees in the past.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Enerflex and Exterran to pursue alternatives to the transaction and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Exterran for greater consideration than what Enerflex has agreed to pay.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Exterran to sell its business to a party other than Enerflex, or for Enerflex to sell its business. These provisions include a general prohibition on each party soliciting any alternative proposal. Further, there are only limited circumstances in which Exterran may terminate the Merger Agreement to accept an alternative proposal and limited exceptions to each party\u2019s agreement that its board of directors will not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other party the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Exterran board makes an adverse recommendation change, then Exterran may be required to pay to Enerflex a termination payment of $10.0 million. In the event that the Enerflex board makes an adverse recommendation change, then Enerflex may be required to pay to Exterran a termination payment of $20.0 million. The parties believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, but these restrictions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of either Exterran or Enerflex from considering or proposing an alternative proposal.\nIf an alternative proposal to acquire Exterran is made, consummation of the Merger may be delayed or impeded.\nIf an alternative proposal to acquire Exterran is made, the attention of Exterran\u2019s and Enerflex\u2019s respective management may be diverted away from the Merger, which may delay or impede consummation of the Merger. Matters related to such alternative proposal, including any potential related litigation, may require commitments of time and resources of both parties and their respective representatives, which could otherwise have been devoted to the Merger.\nExterran stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the proposed merger.\nUnder the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, because the merger consideration is in the form of a stock for stock exchange, no dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights are available to the holders of Exterran common stock with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nNatural disasters, public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other catastrophic events outside of our control may adversely affect our business or the business of third parties on which we depend.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and aggressive actions taken in response to it have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and created significant volatility and disruption across most industries, including ours. In response to the pandemic, governmental authorities mandated shutdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, stay at home orders and advisories, and other restrictions. Some (but not all) of these restrictions have been gradually relaxed and subsequently re-imposed and relaxed again as various areas have experienced resurgences and declines of COVID-19 cases; areas in the future may re-impose additional restrictions.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, including the effectiveness and availability of vaccines and other treatments; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and customer demand for our products, solutions, and services; our ability to sell and provide our products, solutions, and services, including as a result of supplier disruptions, travel restrictions, economic shutdowns, and people working from home; the ability of our customers to pay for our products, solutions, and services; any closures of our and our customers\u2019 offices and facilities; and the availability and effectiveness of vaccines or other treatment for this particular coronavirus.\nWe are following local governmental guidance for viral spread mitigation, including having many of our employees who would traditionally work in an office work from home, and have put in place additional health and safety measures to protect our employees, our customers and other parties who are working at our operating sites. While some of our employees can work remotely, many of our projects require our employees to travel to operating sites. The ability of our employees and our suppliers\u2019 and customers\u2019 employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19, or by their inability to travel as a result of the mitigation measures noted above. See Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of COVID-19 on our Business for further discussion of our response to, and the impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nMany countries significantly shut down their economies to mitigate the spreading of the virus, thus impacting consumer spending and reducing demand for oil and natural gas. Although economies are making progress in reopening, any full or partial future shutdowns imposed in an attempt to gain further control over the spread of the virus could directly or indirectly impact the demand for and pricing of our products, solutions and services and negatively impact our operating results especially if there are returns to shutdowns in the future. Future deterioration in economic conditions, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could lead to a prolonged decline in demand for our products, solutions and services and negatively impact our business.\nLow oil and natural gas prices could depress or reduce demand or pricing for our natural gas compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment and services and, as a result, adversely affect our business.\nOur results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the global energy market, including oil and natural gas development, production, processing and transportation. Oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a sustained reduction in oil or natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil or natural gas prices by oil and natural gas exploration, development and production companies can result in their decision to cancel, reduce or postpone major expenditures or to reduce or shut in well production.\nOil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile. In periods of volatile commodity prices, the timing of any change in activity levels by our customers is difficult to predict. As a result, our ability to project the anticipated activity level for our business, and particularly our product sales segment may be limited.\nDuring periods of lower oil or natural gas prices, our customers typically decrease their capital expenditures, which generally results in lower activity levels. A reduction in demand for our products, solutions and services could force us to reduce our pricing substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, customer cash flows and returns on capital drive customer investment priorities. Industry observers believe shareholders are encouraging management teams of energy companies to focus operational and compensation strategies on returns and free cash flow generation rather than solely on growth. To accomplish these strategies, energy companies may need to better prioritize or reduce capital spending, which could impact resource allocation and production, ultimately constraining the amount of new projects by our customers.\nIf our customers seek to preserve capital by canceling contracts, canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment, cease commitments for new contract operations services contracts or new compression, oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment or new water treatment equipment, or cancel or delay orders with us, the demand for our products, solutions and services could be materially and adversely affected. Such a drop in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers finance their exploration and development activities through cash flows from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. During times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition. A reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities, the lack of availability of debt or equity financing, or other factors that negatively impact our customers\u2019 financial condition could result in our customers seeking to preserve capital by reducing prices under existing contracts, cancelling contracts with us, determining not to renew contracts with us, cancelling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression and oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment or water treatment, determining not to enter into contract operations agreements or not to purchase new compression, oil and natural gas processing and treating equipment or water treatment equipment, or determining to cancel or delay orders for our products, solutions and services. Any such action by our customers would reduce demand for our products, solutions and services which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in the event of the financial failure of a customer, we could experience a loss on all or a portion of our outstanding accounts receivable associated with that customer as well as all future expected amounts under our contracts with that customer.\nFailure to timely and cost-effectively execute on larger projects could adversely affect our business.\nSome of our projects have a relatively larger size and scope than the majority of our projects, which can translate into more technically challenging conditions or performance specifications for our products, solutions and services. Contracts with our customers for these projects typically specify delivery dates, performance criteria and penalties for our failure to perform. Any failure to estimate the cost of and execute these larger projects in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur losses on fixed-price contracts, which constitute a significant portion of our business.\nIn connection with projects and services performed under fixed-price contracts, we generally bear the risk of cost over-runs, operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, and supplier and subcontractor pricing and performance, unless additional costs result from customer-requested change orders. Under both our fixed-price contracts and our cost-reimbursable contracts, we may rely on third parties for many support services, and we could be subject to liability for their failures. Any failure to accurately estimate our costs and the time required for a fixed-price project at the time we enter into a contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations in international markets are subject to many risks.\nThe majority of our contract operations and aftermarket services businesses, and a portion of our product sales business, are conducted in countries outside the U.S. We currently operate in approximately 25 countries. With respect to any particular country in which we operate, the risks inherent in our activities may include the following, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:\n\u2022difficulties in managing international operations, including our ability to timely and cost effectively execute projects;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, laws or policies by foreign agencies or governments;\n\u2022work stoppages;\n\u2022inability to train and retain qualified personnel in international markets;\n\u2022the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations;\n\u2022tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022actions by governments or national oil companies that result in the nullification or renegotiation on less than favorable terms of existing contracts, or otherwise result in the deprivation of contractual rights, and other difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations;\n\u2022governmental actions that (i) result in restricting the movement of property or that impede our ability to import or export parts or equipment, (ii) require a certain percentage of equipment to contain local or domestic content, or (iii) require certain local or domestic ownership, control or employee ratios in order to do business in or obtain special incentives or treatment in certain jurisdictions;\n\u2022potentially longer payment cycles;\n\u2022changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including general political unrest, the imposition of sanctions on countries in which we operate or on customers which we service, the nationalization of energy related assets, civil uprisings, community protests, blockades, riots, kidnappings, violence associated with drug cartels and terrorist acts;\n\u2022adverse fines or sanctions from regulatory bodies, legal judgments or settlements (see, for example the section entitled \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" beginning on page 37);\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences or tax law changes;\n\u2022currency controls, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022expropriation, confiscation or nationalization of property without fair compensation;\n\u2022the risk that our international customers may have reduced access to credit because of higher interest rates, reduced bank lending or a deterioration in our customers\u2019 or their lenders\u2019 financial condition;\n\u2022complications associated with installing, operating and repairing equipment in remote locations;\n\u2022limitations on insurance coverage;\n\u2022inflation;\n\u2022the geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences among personnel in different areas of the world; and\n\u2022difficulties in establishing new international offices and the risks inherent in establishing new relationships in foreign countries.\nIn addition, we may expand our business in international markets where we have not previously conducted business. The risks inherent in establishing new business ventures, especially in international markets where local customs, laws and business procedures present special challenges, may affect our ability to be successful in these ventures or avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUncertain geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nUncertain geopolitical conditions, including the invasion of Ukraine, sanctions, and other potential impacts on this region's economic environment and currencies, may cause demand for our products and services to be volatile, cause abrupt changes in our customers' buying patterns, interrupt our ability to supply products to this or other regions or limit customers' access to financial resources and ability to satisfy obligations to us.\nOur contract operations segment is dependent on companies that are controlled by the government in which it operates.\nThe countries with our largest contract operations businesses include Argentina, Brazil and Oman. We generate a significant portion of our revenue in these countries from national oil companies, including Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales in Argentina, Petrobras in Brazil and Petroleum Development Oman in Oman. Contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater commercial, political and operational risks than we assume in other contracts. Our ability to resolve disputes or enforce contractual provisions may be negatively impacted by the significant bargaining leverage that national oil companies have over us. If our national oil company customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate.\nWe operate in many international countries and anticipate that there will be instances in which costs and revenues will not be exactly matched with respect to currency denomination. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in currencies other than our subsidiaries\u2019 functional currency are included in our statements of operations. In addition, currency fluctuations cause the U.S. dollar value of our international results of operations and net assets to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. A decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As we expand geographically, we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In the future, we may utilize derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could potentially impact our future earnings and forecasted cash flows. However, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our inability to hedge against some or all of these risks and/or increase our cost of conversion of local currency to U.S. dollar.\nSee further discussion of foreign exchange risks under Item 7A \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe termination of or any price reductions under certain of our contract operations services contracts could have a material impact on our business.\nThe termination of a contract or a demand by our customers to reduce prices for our contract operations services contracts may lead to a reduction in our revenues and net income, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may be unable to renew, or enter into new, contracts with customers on favorable commercial terms, if at all. To the extent we are unable to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on terms that are favorable to us or to successfully manage our overall contract mix over time, our business, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nOur backlog may be subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.\nThe expected future revenues reflected in our backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits if realized. Due to potential project cancellations or changes in project scope and schedule, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be performed. In addition, even when a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us or poor project performance could increase the cost associated with a project. Delays, suspensions, cancellations, payment defaults, scope changes and poor project execution could materially reduce or eliminate revenues or profits that we actually realize from projects in backlog. We may be at greater risk of delays, suspensions and cancellations during periods of low oil and natural gas prices.\nReductions in our backlog due to cancellation or modification by a customer or for other reasons may adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Contracts in our backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects. These cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out-of-pocket costs, revenues for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed. However, we may not have a contractual right upon cancellation to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various claims, litigation and other proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings. We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to various claims, which, if not resolved within amounts we have accrued, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, any claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nWe also may be adversely affected by the outcome of pending or threatened litigation, especially in countries outside the United States in which very large and unpredictable damage awards may occur; by government enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations; or by state and foreign government actors as well as private plaintiffs acting in parallel that attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agendas, gain political notoriety, or obtain monetary awards from the company. See, for example the section entitled \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" beginning on page 37.\nWe depend on particular suppliers and may be vulnerable to product shortages and price increases.\nSome of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks, including price increases, product quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner. Additionally, we occasionally experience long lead times from our sources for major components and may at times make purchases in anticipation of future business. We do not have long-term contracts with some of these sources, and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a negative impact on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships. Further, a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could negatively impact on our results of operations.\nWe face significant competitive pressures that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nOur businesses face intense competition and have low barriers to entry. Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to technological changes within our industry, changes in economic and market conditions or more readily take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities. Our ability to renew or replace existing contract operations services contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors. If our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products, equipment or services or substantially decrease the price at which they offer their products, equipment or services, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nIn addition, we could face significant competition from new entrants into the markets we serve. Some of our existing competitors or new entrants may expand or develop new processing, treating and compression equipment that would create additional competition for the products, equipment or services we provide to our customers.\nOur ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.\nWe believe that our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be challenging and important. The supply of experienced operational and field personnel, in particular, decreases as other energy and manufacturing companies\u2019 needs for the same personnel increase. Our ability to grow and to continue our current level of service to our customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.\nOur employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm.\nSafety is a leading focus of our business, and our safety record is critical to our reputation and is of paramount importance to our employees, customers and stockholders. However, we often work on large-scale and complex projects which can place our employees and others near large mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, dangerous processes and in challenging environments. Although we have a functional group whose primary purpose is to implement effective quality, health, safety, environmental and security procedures throughout our company, our safety procedures may fail to be effective and our employees and others may become injured, disabled or lose their lives. As a result, our projects may be delayed or we may be exposed to litigation or investigations.\nUnsafe conditions at project work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase project costs and raise our operating costs. Additionally, many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability, lost project awards or loss of customers. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, environmental discharges and natural disasters, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator and developer, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution or other environmental damage. The insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation, employer\u2019s liability, property, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to risks arising from changes in technology.\nThe supply chains in which we operate are subject to technological changes and changes in customer requirements. We may not successfully develop or implement new or modified types of products or technologies that may be required by our customers in the future. Further, the development of new technologies by competitors could reduce demand for our products and affect our financial performance. Should we not be able to maintain or enhance the competitive values of our products or develop and introduce new products or technologies successfully, or if new products or technologies fail to generate sufficient revenues to offset research and development costs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur information technology infrastructure could be subject to service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, which could result in the disruption of operations or the loss of data confidentiality.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet and third-party service providers, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, collection, communication with our employees, customers, suppliers, dealers and suppliers, business acquisitions and other corporate transactions, compliance with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and research and development. These information technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power outages, hardware failures, undetected errors or computer viruses. While we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, if these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Further, we cannot ensure we have insurance coverages to cover these issues.\nIn addition, information technology security threats and sophisticated cyber-based attacks, including, but not limited to, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, worms, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, or physical breaches, may cause deliberate or unintentional damage, destruction or misuse, manipulation, denial of access to or disclosure of confidential or important information by our employees, suppliers or third-party service providers. Additionally, advanced persistent attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems and those of third-party service providers we rely on are increasing in sophistication and frequency. We have experienced attacks on our information technology systems and networks, and we expect to continue to confront attempts by hackers and other third parties to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks. These attacks to date have not resulted in unauthorized access to confidential information regarding our customers, suppliers or employees and have not had a material impact on our business. However, we could in the future experience attacks that materially disrupt our business or result in access to such confidential information about our customers, suppliers and employees or material information about our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe are continuously developing and enhancing our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. This continued development and enhancement will require us to expend additional resources, including to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities that may be detected. Despite our ongoing investments in security resources, talent, and business practices, we are unable to assure that these enhanced security measures will be effective.\nWe can provide no assurance that our efforts to actively manage technology risks potentially affecting our systems and networks will be successful in eliminating or mitigating risks to our systems, networks and data or in effectively resolving such risks when they materialize. A failure of or breach in information technology security of our own systems, or those of our third-party suppliers, could expose us and our employees, customers, dealers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromise of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. Any of these events in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, including loss of customers and revenue, business, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nTo conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national and state borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of E.U. law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, became effective in May 2018. Other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders and various states are enacting additional data laws that may impact us. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations; failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to, for example, export controls, currency exchange, labor and employment and taxation. Many of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. From time to time, as part of our operations we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities in the various countries in which we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance, any of which may have a negative impact on our financial condition, profitability and results of operations.\nOur international operations require us to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage.\nWe operate in many parts of the world that experience high levels of corruption, and our business brings us in frequent contact with foreign officials. Our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. If we undergo an investigation of potential violations of anti-corruption laws or if we fail to comply with these laws, we may incur significant legal expenses or be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other sanctions and remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe also are subject to other laws and regulations governing our operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons and customs requirements. Trade control laws are complex and constantly changing. Our compliance policies and programs increase our cost of doing business and may not work effectively to ensure our compliance with trade control laws. If we undergo an investigation of potential violations of trade control laws by U.S. or foreign authorities or if we fail to comply with these laws, we may incur significant legal expenses or be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other sanctions and remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the U.S. and internationally and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governments. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Moreover, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Changes to our tax positions resulting from tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges from taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nU.S. federal, state, local and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, and adversely affect demand for our products.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil, from dense subsurface rock formations. We do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our customers do. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state agencies, but recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, and proposals have been made to enact separate U.S. federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.\nFor example, at the U.S. federal level, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act, and proposed regulations under the CWA governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations. On March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) released a final rule that updates existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on U.S. federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. The final rule never went into effect due to pending litigation and on December 28, 2017, the BLM announced that it had rescinded the 2015 final rule, in part citing a review that found that each of the 32 states with federal oil and gas leases has regulations that already address hydraulic fracturing.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of, or prohibiting the performance of, drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. In addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and natural-gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, in 2018, Colorado voters ultimately rejected Proposition 112, a Colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in Colorado. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where our natural gas exploration and production customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. In countries outside of the U.S., including provincial, regional, tribal or local jurisdictions therein where we conduct operations, there may exist similar governmental restrictions or controls on our customers\u2019 hydraulic fracturing activities, which, if such restrictions or controls exist or are adopted in the future, our foreign customers may face the same challenges as our U.S. customers. Any such restrictions, domestically or foreign, could reduce demand for our products, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers\u2019 inability to acquire adequate supplies of water or dispose of or recycle the water used in operations, could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, and adversely affect demand for our products.\nOil and gas development activities require the use of water. For example, the hydraulic fracturing process to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be a scarcity of water for drilling activities due to various factors, including insufficient local aquifer capacity or government regulations restricting the use of water. Our customers\u2019 inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle the water used in operations, could adversely impact our or our customers\u2019 operations in certain areas. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations, could further restrict our customers\u2019 ability to conduct certain operations disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. Any such restrictions could reduce demand for our products, and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the environment, and worker health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance. Certain of these laws also may impose joint and several and strict liability for environmental contamination, which may render us liable for remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that may have been lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior owners or operators or other third parties. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations, and costs associated with new information, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could negatively impact our financial condition, profitability and results of operations.\nWe may need to apply for or amend facility permits or licenses from time to time with respect to storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling, or air emissions relating to manufacturing activities or equipment operations, which subjects us to new or revised permitting conditions. These permits and authorizations may contain numerous compliance requirements, including monitoring and reporting obligations and operational restrictions, such as emission limits, which may be onerous or costly to comply with. Given the large number of facilities in which we operate, and the numerous environmental permits and other authorizations that are applicable to our operations, we may occasionally identify or be notified of technical violations of certain requirements existing in various permits or other authorizations. Occasionally, we have been assessed penalties for our non-compliance, and we could be subject to such penalties in the future.\nThe modification or interpretation of existing environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production, gathering and pipeline companies, including our customers, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nGlobal climate change is an increased international concern and could increase operating costs or reduce the demand for our products, solutions and services.\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. For example, in December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and represent a progression in their intended greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. While the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement, President Biden has recommitted the U.S. to the Paris Agreement, and a significant number of U.S. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the U.S. have also announced an intent to honor the U.S.\u2019s commitments. Several U.S. cities, counties and state governments have also filed lawsuits against certain oil and gas companies seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. To date, none of these suits have been successful, and we are not a party to these proceedings. In the U.S., the EPA has also begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the federal Clean Air Act and regulatory agencies and legislative bodies in other countries where we operate have adopted greenhouse gas emission reduction programs. The adoption of new or more stringent legislation or regulatory programs restricting greenhouse gas emissions in any of the jurisdictions where we or our customers operate could require us to incur higher operating costs or increase the cost of, and thus reduce the demand for, the hydrocarbon products of our customers. These increased costs or reduced demand could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability or results of operations.\nScientists have concluded that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere may produce physical effects, such as increased severity and frequency of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events. To the extent there are significant changes in the Earth\u2019s climate in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations could be materially impacted, and demand for our products, solutions and services could fall. Demand for our products, solutions and services may also be adversely affected by conservation plans and efforts undertaken in response to global climate change. Many governments also provide, or may in the future provide, tax advantages and other subsidies to support the use and development of alternative energy technologies. Our operations and the demand for our products, solutions and services or our customers\u2019 products could be materially impacted by the development and adoption of these technologies.\nRecently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for companies engaged in business involving fossil fuels, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, investment funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. This could make it more difficult for us or our customers to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream energy business activities, or could adversely affect the terms of the funding that is able to be obtained, if any.\nRisks Related to Our Level of Indebtedness\nOur outstanding debt obligations or our ability to refinance our debt obligations at favorable rates could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure to risk during adverse economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a long-term debt balance of $571.8 million. Many factors, including factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness or affect our ability to refinance our debt at favorable rates. These factors include those discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors and those listed in the Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section included in Part I of this Annual report.\nOur debt and associated commitments could have important adverse consequences. For example, these commitments could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our contractual obligations;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other corporate requirements;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on borrowings under our revolving credit facility are based upon variable interest rates and can adjust based upon certain financial covenant ratios;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or less restrictive covenants in such debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit agreement, consisting of a $650.0 million revolving credit facility expiring in October 2023, contains various covenants with which we, Exterran Energy Solutions, L.P. (\u201cEESLP\u201d), our wholly owned subsidiary, and our respective restricted subsidiaries must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, investments, liens on assets, repurchasing equity, making distributions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, dispositions of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. Additionally, we are required to maintain certain financial covenant ratios. If we fail to remain in compliance with these restrictions and financial covenants, we would be in default under our credit agreement. In addition, if we experience a material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations that, taken as a whole, impact our ability to perform our obligations under our credit agreement, this could lead to a default. A default under one of our debt agreements might trigger cross-default provisions under our other debt agreement, which would accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness under those agreements. If the repayment obligations on any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not be able to repay the debt or refinance the debt on acceptable terms, and our financial position would be materially adversely affected. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreement.\nAs a result of a covenant restriction included in our credit agreement, $160.4 million of the $372.8 million of undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility was available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 2021.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect our results of operations.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. In particular, on July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee consisting of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), an index supported by short-term Treasury repurchase agreements. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of USD LIBOR announced that it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023, providing additional time for existing contracts that are dependent on LIBOR to mature. It is unclear whether, at that time, LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. As of December 31, 2021, $225.0 million of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility had interest rate payments determined directly or indirectly based on LIBOR. Any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of LIBOR relative to its historic values. If the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, or if LIBOR ceases to perform as it has historically, our interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase. Further, when LIBOR ceases to exist, we may be forced to substitute an alternative reference rate under our revolving credit facility or rely on base rate borrowings in lieu of LIBOR-based borrowings. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for USD LIBOR, it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the U.S. Any such alternative reference rate may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs, business and results of operations.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our shareholders\u2019 ownership in us would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect our shareholders.\nRisks Related to the Spin-off\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities of Archrock.\nOn November 3, 2015, we completed our spin-off (the \u201cSpin-off\u201d) from Archrock, Inc. (\u201cArchrock\u201d). In connection with the Spin-off, certain tax liabilities of Archrock may become our obligations. Pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Archrock consolidated U.S. federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Spin-off is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire Archrock consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Archrock that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Archrock consolidated tax reporting group between us and Archrock. If Archrock is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nOur prior and continuing relationship with Archrock exposes us to risks attributable to businesses of Archrock.\nArchrock is obligated to indemnify us for losses that third parties may seek to impose upon us or our affiliates for liabilities relating to the business of Archrock that are incurred through a breach of the separation and distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement by Archrock or its affiliates other than us, or losses that are attributable to Archrock in connection with the Spin-off or are not expressly assumed by us under our agreements with Archrock. Any claims made against us that are properly attributable to Archrock in accordance with these arrangements would require us to exercise our rights under our agreements with Archrock to obtain payment from Archrock. We are exposed to the risk that, in these circumstances, Archrock cannot, or will not, make the required payment.\nIn connection with our separation from Archrock, Archrock will indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we will indemnify Archrock for certain liabilities. If we are required to act on these indemnities to Archrock, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and our financial results could be negatively impacted. In the case of Archrock\u2019s indemnity, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or as to Archrock\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with Archrock, Archrock has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify Archrock for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Under the separation and distribution agreement, we and Archrock will generally release the other party from all claims arising prior to the Spin-off that relate to the other party\u2019s business, subject to certain exceptions. Also pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to remove Archrock as a party to certain of our contracts with third parties. In the event that Archrock remains as a party, we expect to indemnify Archrock for any liabilities relating to such contracts. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Archrock will not be subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off.\nWith respect to Archrock\u2019s agreement to indemnify us, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Archrock will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Archrock will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Archrock any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risks Factors\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;\n\u2022general economic and stock market conditions;\n\u2022risks relating to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;\n\u2022changes in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;\n\u2022cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or armed hostilities;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, in each case, as amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. This forum selection provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable or cost-effective for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. However, this forum selection clause will not preclude or limit the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.", "PERMNO": 15710, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "EXTN"}
