{"cik": "313716", "company": "HARDINGE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe various risks related to the Company's business include the risks described below. The business, financial condition or results of operations of Hardinge could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nOur customers' activity levels and spending for our products and services have been impacted by global economic conditions, especially deterioration in the credit markets.\nFor many of our customers, the purchase of our machines represents a significant capital expenditure. For others, the purchase of our machines is a part of a larger improvement or expansion of manufacturing capability. For all, the purchase represents a long term commitment of capital raised by incurrence of debt, issuance of equity or use of cash flow from operations. Global economic and financial difficulties across the world in recent years have been well documented. Governments in Europe, Asia and the U.S. subsequently intervened in an effort to improve economic conditions. These interventions may have reduced the overall impact of the crisis, but also created instability, uncertainty and doubt. During this period, many of our customers experienced uncertain cash flows and reduced access to credit and equity markets, all of which made commitment to larger long term capital projects difficult. While global conditions appear to have improved, similar conditions in the future could negatively impact our operating results.\nChanges in general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of our business could harm our operating results.\nOur business is cyclical in nature, following the strength and weakness of the manufacturing economies in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced, and in the future we can be expected to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income, which may affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the market price of our common shares.\nThe following factors, among others, significantly influence demand for our products:\n\u25aa\nFluctuations in capacity at both OEMs and job shops;\n\u25aa\nThe availability of skilled machinists;\n\u25aa\nThe need to replace machines that have reached the end of their useful life;\n\u25aa\nThe need to replace older machines with new technology that increases productivity, reduces general manufacturing costs, and machines parts in a new way;\n\u25aa\nThe evolution of end-use products requiring machining to more specific tolerances;\n\u25aa\nOur customers' use of new materials requiring machining by different processes;\n\u25aa\nGeneral economic and manufacturing industry expansions and contractions; and\n\u25aa\nChanges in manufacturing capabilities in developing regions.\nOur competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.\nThe machine tool industry is subject to technological change, rapidly evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings, especially with respect to computer-controlled products. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customer requirements and product offerings by competitors, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, will be significant factors in our ability to compete and grow. Moreover, if technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by our competitors or others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Failure to effectively introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers to obtain certain components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products. Delays in deliveries from or the loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional costs, result in delays in manufacturing and delivering our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory.\nSome components, sub-assemblies, or assemblies we use in the manufacturing of our products are purchased from a limited number of suppliers. Our purchases from these suppliers are generally not made pursuant to long-term contracts and are subject to additional risks associated with purchasing products internationally, including risks associated with potential import restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, as well as changes in tax laws, tariffs, and freight rates. Although we believe that our relationships with these suppliers are good, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these products from these suppliers on satisfactory terms indefinitely. The present economic environment could also pose the risk of one of these key suppliers going out of business, or cause delays in delivery times of critical components as business conditions rebound and demand increases.\nWe believe that design changes could be made to our machines to allow sourcing of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies or products from several other suppliers; however, a disruption in the supply from any of our suppliers could cause us to experience a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.\nWe manufacture a substantial portion of our products overseas and sell our products throughout the world. In 2014, approximately 68% of our products were sold in countries outside of North America. In addition, a majority of our employees are located outside of the United States. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These factors include:\n\u25aa\nA prolonged world-wide economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our principal international markets including Asia and Europe;\n\u25aa\nChanges in political, regulatory, legal, or economic conditions;\n\u25aa\nRestrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas, customs duties and tariffs, or trade barriers erected by either the United States or other countries where we do business;\n\u25aa\nDisruptions of capital and trading markets;\n\u25aa\nChanges in import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25aa\nTransportation delays;\n\u25aa\nCivil disturbances or political instability;\n\u25aa\nGeopolitical turmoil, including terrorism or war;\n\u25aa\nCurrency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25aa\nChanges in labor standards;\n\u25aa\nLimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n\u25aa\nNationalization and expropriation;\n\u25aa\nChanges in domestic and foreign tax laws;\n\u25aa\nDifficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and\n\u25aa\nHealth epidemics and other localized health risks.\nAdditionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, and anti-corruption regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer products in one or more countries, and could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not violate these policies.\nOur business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our sales, earnings and profitability.\nThe markets in which our machines and other products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete primarily with other businesses on quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service, and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European, and Asian competitors, many of which are larger, have greater financial and other resources, and are supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies. Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional product features or services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our earnings.\nThe greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions. Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product innovations that could put us at a disadvantage. If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers in our marketplace, we could lose customers, and our sales may decline. There can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers, that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets. While we believe our product lines compete effectively in their markets, we may not continue to do so.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe may elect to increase our product offerings and the markets we serve through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u25aa\nDifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u25aa\nDiversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u25aa\nPotential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development;\n\u25aa\nDifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u25aa\nInitial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;\n\u25aa\nDifficulties in predicting market demand for acquired products and technologies and the resultant risk of acquiring excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u25aa\nInsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions; and\n\u25aa\nThe potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.\nAcquisitions may also cause us to:\n\u25aa\nIssue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders' percentage ownership;\n\u25aa\nIncrease our level of indebtedness;\n\u25aa\nAssume liabilities;\n\u25aa\nRecord goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u25aa\nIncur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u25aa\nIncur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; and\n\u25aa\nBecome subject to litigation.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent or future acquisitions, if any, will be successful and will not have material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Additionally, we may incur significant expenses related to potential acquisitions that are not completed. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products, technologies, facilities, and personnel to an inability to do so. Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.\nIf we are unable to access additional capital on favorable terms, our liquidity, business, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe ability to raise financial capital, either in public or private markets or through commercial banks, is critical to our current business and future growth. Our business is generally working capital intensive requiring a long cash-out to cash-in cycle. In addition, we will rely on the availability of longer-term debt financing or equity financing to make investments in new opportunities. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors including the following:\n\u25aa\nChanges in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing facilities on acceptable terms;\n\u25aa\nA deterioration in our financial condition that would violate current loan agreement covenants or prohibit us from obtaining additional capital from banks, financial institutions, or investors;\n\u25aa\nExtreme volatility in credit markets that increase margin or credit requirements; and\n\u25aa\nVolatility in our results that would substantially increase the cost of our capital.\nWe are subject to significant foreign exchange and currency risks that could adversely affect our operations and our ability to reinvest earnings from operations.\nOur international operations generate sales in a number of foreign currencies including British Pound Sterling (\"GBP\"), Chinese Renminbi (\"CNY\"), Euros (\"EUR\"), Indian Rupee (\"INR\"), New Taiwanese Dollars (\"TWD\"), and Swiss Francs (\"CHF\"). Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar (\"USD\"). In addition, our purchases of components in CNY, EUR, TWD, CHF, and Japanese Yen (\"JPY\") are affected by inter-currency fluctuations in exchange rates.\nWe prepare our financial statements in USD in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"), but a sizable portion of our revenue and operating expenses are in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:\n\u25aa\nForeign exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and the implementation or termination of exchange controls; and\n\u25aa\nLimitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries.\nChanges in exchange rates will result in increases or decreases in our revenues, costs, and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside of the United States and the amount of our invested equity. Although we may seek to decrease our currency exposure by engaging in hedges against significant transactions and balance sheet currency exposures where we deem it appropriate, we do not hedge against translation risks. Though we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates, and utilize currency exchange forward contracts and swaps to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, changes in exchange rates nonetheless cannot always be predicted or hedged. Consequently, we cannot assure that any efforts to minimize our risk to currency movements will be successful. To the extent we sell our products in markets other than the market in which they are manufactured, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for customers in those markets.\nPrices of some raw materials, especially steel and iron, fluctuate, which can adversely affect our sales, costs, and profitability.\nWe manufacture products with a relatively high iron casting or steel content, commodities for which worldwide prices fluctuate. The availability of and prices for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs, and anticipated or perceived shortages. In some cases, raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases, they cannot. If raw material prices increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, it would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur expenditures for post-retirement pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect or we are required to use different assumptions.\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense, the funding status of our plans and related charges in other comprehensive income (loss), and required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate. Should the assets earn a return less than the assumed rate of return over time, it is likely that future pension expenses and funding requirements would increase. Investment earnings in excess of the assumed rate of return may reduce future pension expenses and funding requirements. A change in the discount rate would impact the funded status of our plans. An increase to the discount rate would generally reduce the pension liability and future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would generally increase the pension liability and the future pension expense.\nThe market-related value of assets for our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan recognizes asset losses and gains over a five-year period, which we believe is consistent with the long-term nature of our pension obligations. As a result, the effect of changes in the market value of assets on our pension expense may be experienced in future years rather than fully reflected in the expense for the year immediately following the year in which the fluctuations actually occurred.\nIn addition, we cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Contribution levels are largely contingent on asset returns and corporate bond yields. If the performance of the assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan does not meet our expectations and/or corporate bond yields decrease, our future contributions to the plan could increase.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees to work at our manufacturing facilities, our operations and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe conduct substantially all of our manufacturing operations in less densely populated urban areas, which, in many cases, may represent a relatively small market for skilled labor force. Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at these locations. If we are not able to attract and retain the personnel we require, we may be unable to develop, manufacture, and market our products, or to expand our operations in a manner that best exploits market opportunities and capitalizes on our investment in our business. This would materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDue to future technological changes, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.\nThe technologies incorporated in our products change and generally new versions of machines are brought to market in three to five year cycles. The phasing out of an old product involves both estimating the amount of inventory to hold to satisfy the final demand for those machines as well as to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen changes in technology, market demand, or competition, we may have to write off unusable inventory at some time in the future, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMajor changes in the economic situation of our customer base could require us to write off significant portion of our receivables from customers.\nIn difficult economic periods, our customers lose work and find it difficult if not impossible to pay for products purchased from us. Although appropriate credit reviews are done at the time of sale, rapidly changing economic conditions can have sudden impacts on our customers' ability to pay. We run the risk of bad debt on existing time payment contracts and open accounts. If we write off significant parts of our customer accounts or notes receivable because of unforeseen changes in their business condition, it would adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIf we suffer damage to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur factories, facilities, and distribution system are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our facilities in Southeast Asia are located in areas with above average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility.\nOur business operations may be adversely affected by interruptions or failures of our technology information systems.\nWe are dependent on multiple information technology systems throughout our company to operate our business. An interruption or failure of our information technology systems, or a cybersecurity attack, such as unauthorized access, malicious software or other intrusion, may result in a significant disruption of our business operations and materially increase our costs of operations.\nWe rely in part on independent distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we depend on the services of independent distributors and agents to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers. We support an extensive distributor and agent network worldwide. In 2014, approximately 66% of our sales were through distributors and agents. No distributor accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated sales in 2014. Rather than serving as passive conduits for delivery of product, many of our distributors are active participants in the sale and support of our products. Many of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers. In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically cancelable by the distributor after a relatively short notice period. The loss of a substantial number of our distributors or an increase in the distributors' sales of our competitors' products to our customers could reduce our sales and profits.\nWe rely on estimated forecasts of our customers' needs, and inaccuracies in such forecasts could adversely affect our business.\nWe generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of long-term purchase commitments. Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers and the general economic environment, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture. Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay, or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us. For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers' actual product needs. The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly. Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer's specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay, or other modification in our customers' orders could significantly reduce our revenue, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue. In the event of a cancellation or reduction of a customer order, we may not have enough time to reduce inventory purchases or our workforce to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business. Order cancellations typically average approximately 2% of sales. Cancellations could vary significantly during times of global economic uncertainty.\nWe could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture, which could result in us having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material amounts in damages or settlement.\nWe face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects. We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage; however, such insurance does not cover all types of damages that could be assessed against us in a product liability claim and the coverage amounts are subject to certain limitations under the applicable policies. We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.\nCurrent employment laws or changes in employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal, state and foreign labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and costs to terminate or layoff employees. Significant additional government-imposed increases in the following areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow:\n\u25aa\nminimum wages;\n\u25aa\nmandated health benefits;\n\u25aa\npaid leaves of absence;\n\u25aa\nmandatory severance payments; and\n\u25aa\nemployment taxes.\nWe are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters. Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property we own and on adjacent parcels of real property.\nWe believe, based upon information currently available that, except with respect to the environmental matter concerning the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site as described in Part I Item 1. \"Business - Environmental Matters\", we will not have material liabilities for environmental remediation. Though the foregoing reflects the Company's current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.\nThe loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe loss of senior management and other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departing personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, to prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company. Our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Ineffective internal controls subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to periodically furnish a report by our management regarding, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under New York law may discourage a third party from acquiring us.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a proposal to acquire us and, as a result, may inhibit a change in control of the Company under circumstances that could give the shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common shares. These include:\nStaggered Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that our Board of Directors, currently consisting of seven members, is divided into three classes of directors, with each class consisting of two or three directors, and with the classes serving staggered three-year terms. This classification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.\nRemoval of Directors and Filling of Vacancies. Our certificate of incorporation provides that a member of our Board of Directors may be removed only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the securities entitled to vote at an election of directors. Newly created directorships and Board of Director vacancies resulting from retirement, death, removal or other causes may be filled only by a majority vote of the then remaining directors. Accordingly, it is more difficult for shareholders, including those holding a majority of our outstanding shares, to force an immediate change in the composition of our Board of Directors.\nSupermajority Voting Provisions for Certain Business Combinations. Our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of all of the securities entitled to vote and at least 75% of shareholders who are not Major Shareholders (defined as 10% beneficial holders) in order to effect certain mergers, sales of assets or other business combinations involving the Company. These provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company.\nIn addition, as a New York corporation we are subject to provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire and exercise control over us pursuant to a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders. These provisions could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests or changes in control.\nOur shareholders may experience further dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances.\nIn order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions, we may in the future offer, issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities. Our shareholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances. Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders.\nIn addition, we have filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing us to offer, from time to time and at any time, up to $100.0 million of equity securities (including common or preferred shares), subject to market conditions and other factors. The shares sold under the controlled equity offerings are the only equity securities sold pursuant to such registration statement thus far. Accordingly, we may, from time to time and at any time, seek to offer and sell our equity securities, including sales of shares of common stock, based upon market conditions and other factors.\nUnder a Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. on August 9, 2013, we have sold approximately $14.6 million of shares of our common stock, as of December 31, 2014, through \"at-the-market\" offerings, and may offer and sell, from time to time through such offerings an additional amount of up to an aggregate offering price of $25.0 million of shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 81620, "SIC": 3541, "TIC": "HDNG"}
