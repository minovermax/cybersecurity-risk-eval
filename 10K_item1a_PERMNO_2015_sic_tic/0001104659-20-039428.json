{"cik": "892832", "company": "SANDSTON CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO SANDSTON CORPORATION\nWE HAVE HAD NO OPERATING HISTORY SINCE APRIL 2004 AND NO REVENUES OR EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS SINCE APRIL 2004\nWe have had no operations, revenues, or earnings since April 2004. We have no material assets. We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in us incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until we can consummate a business combination with a profitable business entity. There is no assurance that we can continue financing our administrative expenses out of available funds or that we will be able to raise additional funds to cover any shortfall. There is no assurance that we can identify such a business entity and consummate such an agreement or combination.\nWE WILL HAVE NO OPERATING HISTORY AND THEREFORE WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS INHERENT IN ESTABLISHING A NEW BUSINESS\nWe have not identified what our new line of business will be; therefore, we cannot fully describe the specific risks presented by such business. It is likely that we will have had no operating history in the new line of business and it is possible that the target company may have a limited operating history in its business. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our future operations will generate operating or net income, and as such our success will be subject to the risks, expenses, problems and delays inherent in establishing a new line of business for us. The ultimate success of such new business cannot be assured.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY AND ACQUIRE A SUITABLE MERGER PARTNER OR ACQUISITION CANDIDATE\nWe are pursuing a strategy of identifying suitable merger partners and acquisition candidates that will serve as a platform company. Although we are not targeting specific business industries for potential acquisitions, we plan to seek businesses with operations and free cash flow, experienced management teams, and operations in markets offering significant growth opportunities. In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a potential acquisition, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies, private equity groups, venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us which will give them a competitive advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. We may not be able to successfully identify such a business, obtain financing for such acquisition, or successfully operate any business that we identify. We have been working without success since April 2004 to identify a suitable merger partner and consummate an acquisition.\nEven if we identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity, we may be unable to negotiate favorable terms for that acquisition. We may be unable to select, manage or absorb or integrate any future acquisitions successfully. Any acquisition, even if effectively integrated, may not benefit our stockholders. Any acquisitions that we attempt or complete may involve a number of unique risks including: (i) executing successful due diligence; (ii) our exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and (iii) our ability to integrate and absorb the acquired company successfully. We may be unable to address these problems successfully. Our failure to consummate a business combination with a profitable business entity could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EVALUATION OF SUITABLE MERGER PARTNERS AND ACQUISITION CANDIDATES\nAs part of our plan to acquire or invest in strategically positioned companies, our management is seeking, analyzing and evaluating potential acquisition and merger candidates. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, such as due diligence and legal and other professional fees and expenses, as part of these efforts. Notwithstanding these efforts and expenditures, we cannot give any assurance that we will identify an appropriate acquisition opportunity in the near term, or at all.\nSINCE WE HAVE NOT YET SELECTED A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR TARGET BUSINESS TO ACQUIRE, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO CURRENTLY ASCERTAIN THE MERITS OR RISKS OF THE INDUSTRY OR BUSINESS IN WHICH WE MAY ULTIMATELY OPERATE\nBecause we may consummate a merger or acquisition with a company in any industry and are not limited to any particular type of business there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the target business which we may ultimately acquire. If we complete a merger or acquisition with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Even if we properly assess those risks, some of them may be outside of our control or ability to affect. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to our stockholders than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a target business.\nTHE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER RULES ADOPTED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RELATING TO SHELL COMPANIES MAY DELAY OR PREVENT US FROM MAKING CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS\nThe reporting requirements under federal securities law may delay or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.\nSections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, require companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant acquisitions, including certified financial statements for the company acquired, covering one, two, or three years, depending on the relative size of the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare such statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by us. Acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable.\nIn addition to the audited financial statements, in the filing of the Form 8-K that we file to report an event that causes us to cease being a shell company, we will be required to include that information that is normally reported by a company in a Form 10 or Form 10-K. The extensive registration-level information includes a detailed description of a company\u2019s business and properties, management, executive compensation, related party transactions, legal proceedings and historical market price information, as well as audited historical financial statements and management\u2019s discussion and analysis of results of operations. The revised Form 8-K rules also require a shell company to file pro forma financial statements giving effect to the acquisition not later than four business days after completion of the acquisition, instead of 75 days as required by non-shell companies. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare and disclose such information may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by us. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some acquisition prospects to prepare such detailed disclosures and obtain audited financial statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by us, or deter potential targets from negotiating with us.\nOUR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL AFTER AN ACQUISITION MAY BE DEPENDENT UPON THE CONTINUED EFFORTS OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND KEY PERSONNEL WHO MAY JOIN US FOLLOWING SUCH ACQUISITION\nThe role of our management team and key personnel from the target business we acquire cannot presently be ascertained. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a redeployment of our assets, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\nAS A RESULT OF AN ACQUISITION WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SUBSEQUENTLY TAKE WRITE-DOWNS OR WRITE-OFFS, RESTRUCTURING, AND IMPAIRMENT OR OTHER CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR STOCK PRICE, WHICH COULD CAUSE YOU TO LOSE SOME OR ALL OF YOUR INVESTMENT\nWe must conduct a due diligence investigation of the target businesses we intend to acquire. Intensive due diligence is time consuming and expensive due to the operations, accounting, finance and legal professionals who must be involved in the due diligence process. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will reveal all material issues that may affect a particular target business, or that factors outside the control of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. If our diligence fails to identify issues specific to a target business, industry or the environment in which the target business operates, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our common stock. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF OUR NET OPERATING LOSS (\u201cNOL\u201d) CARRYFORWARDS\nNOLs may be carried forward to offset federal and state taxable income in future years and eliminate income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. Based on current federal corporate income tax rates, our NOL carryforwards could provide a benefit to us, if fully utilized, of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these tax benefits in future years will depend upon the amount of our otherwise taxable income. If we do not have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire, we will lose the benefit of these NOL carryforwards permanently. Consequently, our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our substantial NOL will depend significantly on our success in identifying suitable merger partners and/or acquisition candidates, and once identified, successfully consummate a merger with and/or acquisition of these candidates.\nAdditionally, if we underwent an ownership change, the NOL carryforward limitations would impose an annual limit on the amount of the taxable income that may be offset by our NOL generated prior to the ownership change. If an ownership change were to occur, we may be unable to use a significant portion of our NOL to offset taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs when, as of any testing date, the aggregate of the increase in percentage points of the total amount of a corporation\u2019s stock owned by \u201c5-percent stockholders\u201d within the meaning of the NOL carryforward limitations whose percentage ownership of the stock has increased as of such date over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by each such \u201c5-percent stockholder\u201d at any time during the three-year period preceding such date is more than 50 percentage points. In general, persons who own 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s stock are \u201c5-percent stockholders,\u201d and all other persons who own less than 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock are treated together as a public group.\nThe amount of NOL carryforwards that we have claimed has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOL or our determinations as to when a prior change in ownership occurred and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOL to offset taxable income in future years. If the IRS was successful with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOL carryforwards to us could be substantially reduced.\nIF WE EFFECT AN ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH A COMPANY LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL RISKS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS\nWe may effect an acquisition or merger with a company located outside of the United States. If we did, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business\u2019 home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\n\u00b7 rules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n\u00b7 tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u00b7 regulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u00b7 longer payment cycles;\n\u00b7 tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n\u00b7 currency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\u00b7 challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 cultural and language differences;\n\u00b7 employment regulations;\n\u00b7 crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and\n\u00b7 deterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer.\nIF WE EFFECT AN ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH A COMPANY LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO SUCH COMPANY WILL LIKELY GOVERN ALL OF OUR MATERIAL AGREEMENTS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OUR LEGAL RIGHTS\nIf we effect an acquisition or merger with a company located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such company operates will govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. We cannot assure you that the target business will be able to enforce any of its material agreements or that remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we acquire a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under Federal securities laws.\nCOMPLIANCE WITH THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES AND MAY INCREASE THE TIME AND COSTS OF COMPLETING AN ACQUISITION\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and requires that we have such system of internal controls audited. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on management\u2019s evaluation of our system of internal controls. An acquisition target may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls once the public float of our common stock reaches $75 million. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nAN ACQUISITION COULD CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 AND THUS BE REQUIRED TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS AND EXPENSES\nAlthough we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, management believes the Company will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in a business combination that results in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the Securities and Exchange Commission as to the status of our Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and, consequently, any violation of such Act would subject us to material adverse consequences.\nA MERGER OR ACQUISITION WOULD MOST LIKELY BE EXCLUSIVE, RESULTING IN A LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION\nManagement anticipates that it may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because a business partner might require exclusivity. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk to our shareholders because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ONLY ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD AND THERE MAY NOT BE A SUSTAINED TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur shares are listed on the OTC Bulletin Board (the \u201cOTCBB\u201d) under the symbol SDON.\nThe OTCBB is a market maker or dealer-driven system offering quotation and trading reporting capabilities - a regulated quotation service - that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in OTC equity securities. The OTCBB securities are not listed and traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTCBB securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting market makers or dealers in stocks.\nGiven the nature of the OTCBB, stockholders may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of, our common stock, the liquidity of our stock may be reduced, making it difficult for a stockholder to buy or sell our stock at competitive market prices or at all. Accordingly, you should be able to bear the financial risk of losing your entire investment.\nOUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION ON RESALE DUE TO FEDERAL PENNY STOCK RESTRICTIONS\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker or dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange system). The penny stock rules require a broker or dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker or dealer also must provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker or dealer, and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The penny stock rules also require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules, the broker or dealer must make a special written determination that a penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction.\nThese disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market for our stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules, and accordingly, shareholders of our common stock may find it difficult to sell their securities, if at all.\nWE ARE VULNERABLE TO VOLATILE MARKET CONDITIONS\nThe market prices of our common stock have been highly volatile. The market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Please see the table contained in Item 5 of this Report which sets forth the range of high and low closing prices of our common stock for the calendar quarters indicated.\nWE DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE\nAlthough our stockholders may receive dividends if, as and when declared by our Board of Directors, we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not purchase our common stock if you need immediate or future income by way of dividends from your investment.\nOUR AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provides that our Board of Directors will be authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix or alter the designations, preferences, rights and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each series, including the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or designations of any series. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company without further action by our stockholders. Such shares of preferred stock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the number of outstanding shares having voting rights, and by the creation of class or series voting rights.\nWE MAY ISSUE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD CAUSE DILUTION TO CURRENT INVESTORS AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE\nA key element of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions. As part of our acquisition strategy, we may issue additional shares of common stock as consideration for such acquisitions. These issuances could be significant. To the extent that we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common stock as consideration, your equity interest in us will be diluted. Any such issuance will also increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future. Persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be more likely to sell off their common stock, which may influence the price of our common stock. In addition, the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than might otherwise be obtained. We may issue common stock in the future for other purposes as well, including in connection with financings, for compensation purposes, in connection with strategic transactions or for other purposes.\nACCOUNTING IN THE EVENT OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s ASC 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d), requires business combinations to be accounted for under the purchase method. ASC 805 establishes principles for how an aquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets aquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquirer and the goodwill acquired. ASC 350, \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d (\u201cASC 350\u201d), requires the use of a non-amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles. Goodwill is the excess of the acquisition costs of the acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. The Company is required to test goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life for impairments at least annually. The provisions of ASC 350 require the completion of an annual impairment test with any impairment recognized in current earnings. The provisions of ASC 805 and ASC 350 will be applicable to any business combination that we may enter into in the future.\nWe have also been informed that most business combinations will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition with us being the surviving registrant. As a result of any business combination, if the acquired entity\u2019s shareholders will exercise control over us, the transaction will be deemed to be a capital transaction where we are treated as a non-business entity. Therefore, the accounting for the business combination is identical to that resulting from a reverse merger, except no goodwill or other intangible assets will be recorded. For accounting purposes, the acquired entity will be treated as the accounting acquirer and, accordingly, will be presented as the continuing entity.\nIF WE DO ANY BUSINESS COMBINATION, EACH SHAREHOLDER WILL MOST LIKELY HOLD A SUBSTANTIALLY LESSER PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IN THE COMPANY\nIf we enter a business combination with a private concern, that, in all likelihood, would result in the Company issuing securities to shareholders of any such private company. The issuance of our previously authorized and unissued Common Stock would result in reduction in percentage of shares owned by our present and prospective shareholders and may result in a change in our control or in our management.\nOUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER AND WILL BE ABLE TO APPROVE ALL CORPORATE ACTIONS WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER CONSENT AND WILL CONTROL OUR COMPANY\nOur principal shareholder, Daniel J. Dorman, owns or controls 67.73% of our common stock. His wife owns 3.49% of our common stock. Consequently, they will have significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, but not requiring the approval of the minority shareholders. In addition, he is now an officer and director. Because Mr. Dorman and his wife own or control a majority of our common stock, they will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors, allowing them to exercise significant control of our affairs and management. In addition, they may transact most corporate matters requiring shareholder approval by written consent, without a duly-noticed and duly-held meeting of shareholders.", "PERMNO": 82509, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "SDON"}
