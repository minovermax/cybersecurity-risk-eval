{"cik": "1347858", "company": "22nd Century Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and in other reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The matters discussed in the risk factors, and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and future growth prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have had a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe have experienced net losses of approximately $13.0 million, $11.6 million and $11.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. While our current balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment securities is adequate to sustain operations for a number of years, generating net income in the future will depend on our ability to successfully operate our cigarette manufacturing facility, sell and market our proprietary tobacco products, and generate royalty revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property. There is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. An inability to successfully achieve profitability may decrease our long-term viability.\nWe have had a history of negative cash flow, and our ability to sustain positive cash flow is uncertain.\nWe have had a history of negative cash flow from operating activities, before cash used in investing activities and cash provided by financing activities, including approximately $12.1 million of negative cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2017. We believe our current position of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment securities is adequate to sustain operations and to meet all current obligations as they come due for a number of years. Generation of positive cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to successfully implement the net income generating activities discussed in the previous risk factor discussion. An inability to successfully implement our net income producing initiatives may decrease our long-term viability.\nIf regulations by the FDA requiring the reduction of nicotine to minimally or non-addictive levels in all cigarettes sold in the U.S. are delayed or do not become implemented, then the demand for our proprietary Very Low Nicotine tobacco may not substantially increase in the U.S.\nOn July 28, 2017, the FDA publicly announced that it intends to implement new regulations that will mandate minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine in all cigarettes sold in the U.S. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will implement such new regulations or, if implemented, when such regulations would take effect. In the event the FDA does not implement such new regulations or implementation is delayed, then the demand for our proprietary Very Low Nicotine tobacco may not substantially increase in the U.S. and such action would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIf we fail to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approvals for authorization to market BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette, we will be unable to commercialize this potential product in and outside the U.S.\nThere can be no assurance that BRAND A will be approved by the FDA and/or by foreign regulators to be marketed as a Modified Risk Cigarette. In addition, there can be no assurance that all necessary approvals will be granted for our potential products or that review or actions will not involve delays caused by requests for additional information or testing that could adversely affect the time and cost to market and sell our potential products.\nThe development, testing, manufacturing, and marketing of our potential products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and throughout the world. In particular, the process of obtaining approvals by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) and other international FDA equivalent agencies in targeted countries is costly and time consuming, and the time required for such approvals is uncertain. Our BRAND A must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process mandated by the FDA in the U.S. and any other approval processes required by FDA-equivalent agencies in foreign countries where we want to introduce our potential products.\nThe scope of review, including product testing and exposure studies, to be required by the FDA under the Tobacco Control Act in order for cigarettes such as BRAND A to be marketed as Modified Risk Cigarettes has not yet been fully established, even though the FDA issued Modified Risk Tobacco Product Applications Draft Guidance on March 30, 2012. Our first application for BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette experienced delays and took a year to obtain substantial feedback from the FDA. We may be unsuccessful in establishing to the satisfaction of the FDA that BRAND A is a Modified Risk Cigarette. Even upon demonstrating significant reduced exposure to nicotine, the FDA may decide that allowing a modified risk claim is not in the best interest of the public health, and the FDA may not allow us to market our BRAND A cigarettes as Modified Risk Cigarettes. In addition, the time and cost involved in obtaining such approvals may be longer and more costly than anticipated.\nThe FDA could force the removal of our products from the U.S. market.\nThe FDA has broad authority over the regulation of tobacco products. The FDA could, among other things, force us to remove from the U.S. market our BRAND A even after FDA authorization to market BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette, levy fines or change their regulations on advertising. Any adverse action by the FDA could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe intend to distribute and sell our potential products outside of the U.S., which will subject us to other regulatory risks.\nIn addition to seeking approval from the FDA to market our BRAND A as a Modified Risk Cigarette in the U.S., we intend to seek governmental approvals required to market BRAND A and our other products in other countries. Marketing of our products is not permitted in certain countries until we have obtained required approvals or exemptions in these individual countries. The regulatory review process varies from country to country, and approval by foreign governmental authorities is unpredictable, uncertain, and generally expensive. Our ability to market our potential products could be substantially limited due to delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, the necessary approvals or clearances. We anticipate commencing the applications required in some or all of these countries following approval by the FDA; however, we may decide to file applications in advance of the FDA approval if we determine such filings to be both time and cost effective. If we export any of our potential products, or products that have not yet been cleared for commercial distribution in the U.S., then such products may be subject to FDA export restrictions. Failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could impair our ability to generate revenue from international sources.\nOur studies and testing of any of our potential products may produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional studies and/or testing for these potential products or cease our studies and testing.\nWe do not know whether further studies and testing of our potential products will demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficient to result in marketable products. We may not be able to obtain approval or marketing authorization for these potential products or our anticipated time of bringing these potential products to the market may be substantially delayed. We may also experience significant additional development costs and be required to undertake additional studies and/or testing if we change our potential products. Any such delays or costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur working capital requirements involve estimates based on demand expectations and may increase beyond those currently anticipated, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have no experience in selling Modified Risk Cigarettes or smoking cessation products on a commercial basis. As a result, we intend to base our funding and inventory decisions on estimates of future demand. If demand for our products does not increase as quickly as we have estimated, our inventory and expenses could rise, and our business and operating results could suffer. Alternatively, if we experience sales in excess of our estimates, our working capital needs may be higher than those currently anticipated. Our ability to meet any demand for our products may depend on our ability to arrange for additional financing for any ongoing working capital shortages, since it is likely that cash flow from sales will lag behind our investment requirements.\nWe may require additional capital before we can complete the FDA authorization process for our Modified Risk Cigarettes.\nWe may require additional capital in the future before we can complete the FDA authorization process for our Modified Risk Cigarettes. The cost of completing the FDA authorization process for potential Modified Risk Cigarettes is difficult to estimate since it is currently unknown exactly what the FDA will require. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities to complete the FDA authorization process for our Modified Risk Cigarettes, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution, or the equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through debt financings, these financings may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business and make distributions to our stockholders. We could also wait for our own revenues and profits to be sufficient for us to provide such funding, which could delay our completion of the FDA authorization process for our Modified Risk Cigarettes. We also could elect to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or licensees. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our potential products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u00b7 undertake the steps necessary to seek FDA authorization of our Modified Risk Cigarettes;\n\u00b7 develop or enhance our potential products or introduce new products;\n\u00b7 expand our development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative activities;\n\u00b7 attract tobacco growers, customers, or manufacturing and distribution partners;\n\u00b7 acquire complementary technologies, products, or businesses;\n\u00b7 expand our operations in the United States or internationally;\n\u00b7 hire, train, and retain employees; or\n\u00b7 respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nWe have no experience in managing growth. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan or to address competitive challenges adequately.\nFrom 2013 to 2017, we grew from nine (9) employees to seventy-nine (79) employees. Any growth in our business will place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial, information technology and other resources. We intend to further expand our overall business, customer base, employees and operations, which will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures and we may not be able to do so effectively. As such, we may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nWe have limited experience in operating and managing a manufacturing facility.\nWe have limited experience operating and managing a manufacturing facility. The manufacture of products is subject to strict quality control, testing, and record keeping requirements, and continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post-market information. In addition, the manufacturing of our own products will be expensive to operate without sufficient production volume. If we are unable to successfully manufacture or sell our products, we will still be liable for the costs associated with operating a manufacturing facility. Accordingly, the operation of such manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur manufacturing facility is subject to FDA regulations.\nManufacturers of tobacco products must comply with FDA regulations which require, among other things, compliance with the FDA\u2019s evolving regulations on Current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP(s)\u201d), which are enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The manufacture of products is subject to strict quality control, testing and record keeping requirements, and continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post-market information. We cannot guarantee that our current manufacturing facility will pass FDA inspections and/or similar inspections in foreign countries to produce our tobacco products, or that future changes to cGMP manufacturing standards will not also negatively affect the cost or sustainability of our manufacturing facility.\nOur principal competitors in the smoking cessation market have, and any future competitors may have, greater financial and marketing resources than we do, and they may therefore develop products or other technologies similar or superior to ours, or otherwise compete more successfully than we do.\nWe have no experience in selling smoking cessation products. Competition in the smoking cessation aid products industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully compete in the market. In the market for FDA-approved smoking cessation aids, our principal competitors include Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Perrigo Company plc and Novartis International AG. The industry consists of major domestic and international companies, most of which have existing relationships in the markets in which we plan to sell, as well as financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, scaling capacity, distribution and other resources and name recognition substantially greater than ours. In addition, we expect new competitors will enter the markets for our products in the future. Potential customers may choose to do business with our more established competitors because of their perception that our competitors are more stable, are more likely to complete various projects, can scale operations more quickly, have greater manufacturing capacity, are more likely to continue as a going concern, and lend greater credibility to any joint venture. If we are unable to compete successfully against manufacturers of other smoking cessation products, our business could suffer, and we could lose or be unable to obtain market share.\nOur competitors may develop products that are less expensive, safer or otherwise more appealing, which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any potential product that we may commercialize.\nIf our competitors market products that are less expensive, safer or otherwise more appealing than our potential products, or that reach the market before our potential products, we may not achieve commercial success. The market may choose to continue utilizing existing products for any number of reasons, including familiarity with or pricing of these existing products. The failure of our Modified Risk Tobacco Product to compete with products marketed by our competitors would impair our ability to generate revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our competitors may:\n\u00b7 develop and market products that are less expensive, safer, or otherwise more appealing than our products;\n\u00b7 commercialize competing products before we or our partners can launch our products; and\n\u00b7 initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can.\nIf we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively.\nOur competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages that we believe we derive from our research approach and proprietary technologies. Our competitors may:\n\u00b7 operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;\n\u00b7 have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;\n\u00b7 more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and\n\u00b7 take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.\nGovernment mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions, and adverse weather patterns may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.\nWe depend on independent tobacco farmers to grow our specialty proprietary tobaccos with specific nicotine contents for our potential products. As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, diseases, and pests. We must also compete with other tobacco companies for contract production with independent tobacco farmers. Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. Any significant change in tobacco leaf prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key personnel.\nOur success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management team, and in particular Henry Sicignano III, our President and Chief Executive Officer, John T. Brodfuehrer, our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. James Swauger, our Senior Vice President of Science and Regulatory Affairs, and Thomas L. James, our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. The loss or unavailability of any of these individuals may significantly delay or prevent the development of our potential products and other business objectives by diverting management\u2019s attention to transition matters. While each of these individuals is party to employment agreements with us, they could terminate their relationships with us at any time, and we may be unable to enforce any applicable employment or non-compete agreements.\nWe also rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and sales strategies. All of our consultants and advisors are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have conflicts of interest or other commitments, such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations, that may affect their ability to contribute to us.\nProduct liability claims, product recalls or other claims could cause us to incur losses or damage our reputation.\nThe risk of product liability claims or product recalls, and associated adverse publicity, is inherent in the development, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco and smoking cessation products. We do not currently have product liability insurance for our products or our potential products and do not expect to be able to obtain product liability insurance at reasonable commercial rates for these products. Any product recall or lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Though we currently have no pending product liability claims against us, we cannot assure you that such claims will not be made in the future.\nNegative press from being in the hemp/cannabis space could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe hemp plant and the cannabis/marijuana plant are both part of the same cannabis sativa genus/species of plant, except that hemp, by definition, has less than 0.3% THC content and is legal under federal and state laws, but the same plant with a higher THC content is cannabis/marijuana, which is legal under certain state laws, but which is not legal under federal law. The similarities between these plants can cause confusion, and our activities with legal hemp may be incorrectly perceived as us being involved in federally illegal cannabis/marijuana. Also, despite growing support for the cannabis/marijuana industry and legalization of cannabis/marijuana in certain U.S. states, many individuals and businesses remain opposed to the cannabis/marijuana industry. Any negative press resulting from any incorrect perception that we have entered into the cannabis/marijuana space could result in a loss of current or future business. It could also adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with us or to own our common stock. We cannot assure you that additional business partners, including but not limited to financial institutions and customers, will not attempt to end or curtail their relationships with us. Any such negative press or cessation of business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny business-related cannabinoid production is dependent on laws pertaining to the hemp/cannabis industry.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were (i) 34 states in the United States and the District of Columbia that have legalized hemp, (ii) 29 states and the District of Columbia that allow their citizens to use medical cannabis/marijuana and, (iii) 9 states and the District of Columbia that have legalized cannabis/marijuana for adult recreational use. Many other states are considering similar legislation. Conversely, under the federal Controlled Substance Act (the \u201cCSA\u201d), the policies and regulations of the federal government and its agencies are that cannabis/marijuana has no medical benefit and a range of activities are prohibited, including cultivation, possession, personal use, and interstate distribution of cannabis/marijuana. In the event the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical and/or adult recreational cannabis/marijuana, there may be a direct and adverse impact to any future business or prospects that we may have in the cannabis/marijuana business. Even in those jurisdictions in which the manufacture and use of medical cannabis/marijuana has been legalized at the state level, the possession, use, and cultivation of cannabis/marijuana all remain violations of federal law that are punishable by imprisonment and substantial fines. Moreover, individuals and entities may violate federal law if they intentionally aid and abet another in violating these federal controlled substance laws, or conspire with another to violate them.\nWe currently conduct sponsored research on hemp through Anandia Laboratories in Canada and through sponsored research on hemp in Virginia through the University of Virginia (\u201cUVA\u201d), in each case with Anandia and UVA possessing all necessary permits and licenses to engage legally in such activities. In order to carry out research in other countries, similar licenses are required to be issued by the relevant authority in each country.\nLocal, state, federal, and international hemp and cannabis/marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance requirements. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business regarding cannabinoid production. It is also possible that the federal government will begin strictly enforcing existing laws, which may limit the legal uses of the hemp plant and its derivatives and extracts, such as cannabinoids. However, our work in hemp would continue since hemp research, development, and commercialization activities are permitted under applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our activities in the legal hemp industry.\nRisks Related to the Tobacco Industry\nThe third-party tobacco products made in our manufacturing business face significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of significantly restricting the use of tobacco products.\nWe publicly announced that we discontinued U.S. sales of our RED SUN brand cigarettes as of December 31, 2017, in preparation for the planned mandate by the FDA that all cigarettes sold in the United States will be required to contain only minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine. However, most of the remaining revenues of our manufacturing business are from the production of tobacco cigarettes and filtered cigars made for third-party brand owners of such products. Cigarette and filtered cigar companies face significant governmental action, especially in the United States pursuant to the Tobacco Control Act, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use, restricting marketing and advertising, imposing regulations on packaging, mandating warnings and disclosure of flavors or other ingredients, prohibiting the sale of tobacco products with certain flavors or other characteristics, limiting or prohibiting the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packaging sizes, and seeking to hold retailers and distributors responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in the United States and in certain other countries, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce consumption levels in these markets.\nSignificant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in many markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (\u201cFCTC\u201d). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. In addition, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the appeal of tobacco products. Partly because of some, or a combination of these efforts, unit sales of tobacco products in certain markets, principally Western Europe and Japan, have been in general decline and we expect this trend to continue. Our operating results could be significantly affected by any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements.\nIf implemented in the future, the FDA requirement regarding graphic health warnings on cigarette packaging and in cigarette advertising is likely to have a negative impact on sales of our third-party customers\u2019 products.\nIn November 2010, as required by the Tobacco Control Act, the FDA issued a proposed rule to modify the required warnings that appear on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements. These warnings were finalized on June 21, 2011 and consisted of nine new textual warning statements accompanied by color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking. The FDA selected nine images from the originally proposed 36 images after reviewing the relevant scientific literature, analyzing the results from an 18,000-person study, and considering more than 1,700 comments from a variety of groups. The graphic health warnings were to be located beneath the cellophane wrapping on cigarette packages and were to comprise the top 50 percent of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages. Although these graphic health warnings were scheduled to be implemented in September 2012, a federal judge ruled that these warnings are unconstitutional. If these graphic health warnings are implemented in the future, all cigarettes manufactured for sale or distribution in the United States will need to include these new graphic health warnings on their packages. Any reduction in the number of smokers will probably reduce the demand for the products manufactured by our factory for third-party brand owners of such products.\nWe may become subject to litigation related to cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS, which could severely impair our results of operations and liquidity.\nAlthough we are not currently subject to legal proceedings related to cigarette smoking or ETS, we may become subject to litigation related to the sale, upon FDA authorization, of our BRAND A Modified Risk Cigarettes. Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters related to tobacco use are pending or threatened in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Various types of claims are raised in these proceedings, including product liability, consumer protection, antitrust, tax, contraband shipments, patent infringement, employment matters, claims for contribution, and claims of competitors and distributors.\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. The variability in pleadings, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrates that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome.\nDamages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases, range into the billions of dollars. We anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. The FCTC encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. It is possible that our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of litigation.\nCigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may affect the sales of our third-parties customers\u2019 tobacco products manufactured at our factory, which could result in decreased sales and profitability of our manufacturing business.\nTax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes, and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price, upon FDA authorization, of our BRAND A Modified Risk Cigarettes versus lower-priced cigarette brands manufactured by our competitors. Increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes resulting in (i) lower consumption levels, (ii) a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products or to lower-price cigarette categories, (iii) a shift from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, and (iv) illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit.\nWe may become subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.\nTobacco companies are often subject to investigations, including allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of custom duties and/or excise taxes, and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as \u201clights\u201d and \u201cultra-lights.\u201d We cannot predict the outcome of any investigations to which we may become subject, but we may be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of potential future investigations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property, products and potential products, and if we cannot obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property, products and potential products, we may not be able to successfully market our products and potential products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection for our technologies, products, and potential products. We will only be able to protect our technologies, products, and potential products from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents cover them, or to the extent that other market exclusionary rights apply.\nThe patent positions of life sciences companies, like ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies\u2019 patents has emerged to date in the United States. The general patent environment outside the United States also involves significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or that the scope of these patent rights could provide a sufficient degree of future protection that could permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage with respect to these products and technology. Additionally, life science companies like ours are often dependent on creating a pipeline of products. We may not be able to develop additional potential products or proprietary technologies that produce commercially viable products or that are themselves patentable.\nAlthough there are currently no challenges to any portion of our intellectual property, our issued patents may be subject to challenge and potential invalidation by third parties. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States, or in other countries, may diminish the value of our intellectual property. In addition, others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies that may be outside the scope of our intellectual property. Should third parties obtain patent rights to similar products or technology, this may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur patent protection relating to the QPT gene expires in 2018. The expiration of the QPT patent family will give third-parties the freedom to target the QPT gene in experiments to try to reduce nicotine levels in tobacco plants to levels that may satisfy the planned new nicotine reduction regulations coming from the FDA. There can be no assurance about whether any third-parties will or will not be successful in such efforts and/or how long or short in time such efforts will entail. If our competitors are able to successfully reduce nicotine levels in tobacco plants without violating our patent protections, our ability to license our technology would be negatively impacted and we would likely face increased competition.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, products, and potential products, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. While we believe that we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our own, our licensees\u2019 or our strategic partners\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. We seek to protect this information, in part, through the use of non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, advisors, and others. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for a breach. In addition, we cannot ensure that those agreements will provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information, or prevent their unauthorized use or disclosure.\nTo the extent that consultants or key employees apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our products and potential products, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights of the information, which may not be resolved in our favor. Key employees are required to assign all intellectual property rights in their discoveries to us. However, these key employees may terminate their relationship with us, and we cannot preclude them indefinitely from dealing with our competitors. If our trade secrets become known to competitors with greater experience and financial resources, the competitors may copy or use our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods, or technologies. If we were to prosecute a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it could be expensive and time consuming and the outcome could be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than courts in the United States. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, we would lack any contractual claim to this information, and our business could be harmed.\nThe ability to commercialize our potential products will depend on our ability to sell such products without infringing the patent or proprietary rights of third parties. If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nThe ability to commercialize our potential products will depend on our ability to sell such products without infringing the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Third-party intellectual property rights in our field are complicated, and third-party intellectual property rights in these fields are continuously evolving. While we have conducted searches for such third-party intellectual property rights, we have not performed specific searches for third-party intellectual property rights that may raise freedom-to-operate issues, and we have not obtained legal opinions regarding commercialization of our potential products. As such, there may be existing patents that may affect our ability to commercialize our potential products.\nIn addition, because patent applications are published up to 18 months after their filing, and because patent applications can take several years to issue, there may be currently pending third-party patent applications and freedom-to-operate issues that are unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents.\nIf a third-party claims that we infringe on its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of issues that could seriously harm our competitive position, including:\n\u00b7 infringement claims that, with or without merit, can be costly and time consuming to litigate, can delay the regulatory approval process, and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business strategy;\n\u00b7 substantial damages for past infringement which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe upon a competitor\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 a court order prohibiting us from commercializing our potential products or technologies unless the holder licenses the patent or other proprietary rights to us, which such holder is not required to do;\n\u00b7 if a license is available from a holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights; and\n\u00b7 redesigning our process so that it does not infringe the third-party intellectual property, which may not be possible, or which may require substantial time and expense including delays in bringing our potential products to market.\nSuch actions could harm our competitive position and our ability to generate revenue and could result in increased costs.\nOur patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\nWe own or exclusively control many issued patents and pending patent applications. We cannot be certain that these patent applications will issue, in whole or in part, as patents. Patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until the patents are published or are issued. Since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months, we cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions. We also cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor. In addition, patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to U.S. patents will be issued. Furthermore, if these patent applications issue, some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the United States.\nThe status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we or our licensors file will result in patents being issued, or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the near future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our operations.\nWe license certain patent rights from third-party owners. If such owners do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects could be harmed.\nWe license rights to third-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business, and we may enter into additional licensing agreements in the future. Our success could depend in part on the ability of some of our licensors to obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications to which we are licensed. Even if patents are issued with respect to these patent applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we could. Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nOur worldwide exclusive licenses relating to tobacco from NCSU involves multiple patent families. The exclusive rights under the NCSU agreements expire on the date on which the last patent or registered plant variety covered by the subject license expires in the country or countries where such patents or registered plant varieties are in effect. The NCSU licenses relate predominately to issued patents, and our exclusive rights in the NCSU licenses will expire in 2023.\nOur worldwide sublicense from Anandia, a plant biotechnology company based in Vancouver, Canada, grants us exclusive rights in the United States and co-exclusive rights with Anandia everywhere else in the world (except not in Canada where Anandia retains exclusive rights) to certain patents and patent applications relating to certain genes in the hemp/cannabis plant that are required for the production of cannabinoids, the \u201cactive ingredients\u201d in the cannabis plant. The Anandia sublicense continues through the life of the last-to-expire patent, which is expected to be in 2035.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nAn active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. In the absence of an active trading market for our common stock, shares of common stock may not be able to be resold at or above the purchase price of such shares. Although there can be no assurances, we expect that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the New York Stock Exchange American market (\u201cNYSE American\u201d). However, even if our common stock continues to be quoted on the NYSE American, there is no assurance that an active market for our common stock will continue in the foreseeable future. There also can be no assurance that we can maintain such listing on the NYSE American. If we are ever no longer listed on the NYSE American or other national stock exchange in the future, then it would be more difficult to dispose of shares or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock compared to securities of companies whose shares are traded on national stock exchanges.\nOur stock price may be highly volatile and could decline in value.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NYSE American and the market prices for our common stock have been volatile. Further, the market prices for securities in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u00b7 failure or discontinuation of any of our research programs;\n\u00b7 delays in establishing new strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 delays in the development of our potential products and commercialization of our potential products;\n\u00b7 market conditions in our sector and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions, including recent adverse changes in the global financial markets;\n\u00b7 actual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 issues in manufacturing or distributing our products or potential products;\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our products or potential products;\n\u00b7 third-party healthcare reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7 FDA or other United States or foreign regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u00b7 litigation or public concern about the safety of our products or potential products;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 third-party sales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors, or significant stockholders; and\n\u00b7 equity sales by us of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock to fund our operations.\nThese and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nFuture sales of our common stock will result in dilution to our common stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market may depress the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the future sale of our equity securities. Additionally, if the holders of outstanding options or warrants exercise or convert those shares, as applicable, our common stockholders will incur dilution in their relative percentage ownership. The prospect of this possible dilution may also impact the price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid cash dividends to date on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the terms of any future debt facilities may preclude us from paying dividends on the common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock could be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Nevada law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that, together with Nevada law, could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents presently include the following provisions:\n\u00b7 providing for a \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors in which only one-third (1/3) of the directors can be elected in any year;\n\u00b7 authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock; and\n\u00b7 limiting the liability of, and providing indemnifications to, our directors and officers.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our Company or changes in our management.\nAs a Nevada corporation, we also may become subject to the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes Sections 78.378 through 78.3793, which prohibit an acquirer, under certain circumstances, from voting shares of a corporation\u2019s stock after crossing specific threshold ownership percentages, unless the acquirer obtains the approval of the stockholders of the issuer corporation. The first such threshold is the acquisition of at least one-fifth, but less than one-third of the outstanding voting power of the issuer. We may become subject to the above referenced Statutes if we have 200 or more stockholders of record, at least 100 of whom are residents of the State of Nevada and do business in the State of Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation.\nAs a Nevada corporation, we are subject to the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes Sections 78.411 through 78.444, which prohibit an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d from entering into a combination with the corporation, unless certain conditions are met. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, beneficially owns (or within the prior two years did own) 10 percent or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock.\nAny provision of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, our bylaws or Nevada law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of our Company could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14523, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "XXII"}
