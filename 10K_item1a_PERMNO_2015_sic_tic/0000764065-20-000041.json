Described below are certain risks and uncertainties, the occurrences of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Before making an investment decision, you should consider carefully all of the risks described below together with the other information included in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below include known material risks that we face currently. Although we have extensive risk management policies, practices and procedures aimed to mitigate these risks, uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operation. This report is qualified in its entirety by these factors.\nOur ERM function provides a framework for management's consideration of risks when making strategic, financial, operational and/or project decisions. The framework is based on ISO 31000, an internationally recognized risk management standard. Management uses a consistent methodology to identify and assess risks, determine and implement risk mitigation actions, and monitor and communicate information about the Company's most significant risks. Through these processes, we have identified seven categories of risk that we are subject to: (I) economic and market, (II) regulatory, (III) financial, (IV) operational, (V) development and sustainability, (VI) human capital and (VII) risks related to the proposed Merger. The following risk factors are presented according to these key risk categories.\nI.\nECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS\nUncertainty or weaknesses in global economic conditions, reduced economic growth in China and oversupply of iron ore and excess steel or imported products could affect adversely our business.\nThe world price of iron ore is influenced strongly by global economic conditions, including international demand for and supply of iron ore products. In particular, the current level of international demand for raw materials used in steel production is driven largely by industrial growth in China. Uncertainty or weakness in global economic conditions, including the slowing economic growth rate in China, has resulted, and could in the future result, in decreased demand for our products and, together with oversupply of imported products, has and may continue to lead to decreased prices, resulting in lower revenue levels and decreasing margins, which have in the past and may in the future affect adversely our business and negatively impact our financial results. We are not able to predict whether the global economic conditions will improve or worsen and the impact it may have on our operations and the industry in general going forward.\nThe volatility of commodity prices, namely iron ore and steel, affects our ability to generate revenue, maintain stable cash flow and fund our operations, including growth and expansion projects.\nOur profitability is dependent upon the price of the product that we sell to our customers and the price of the products our customers sell, namely iron ore and steel prices. The prices of iron ore and steel have fluctuated significantly in the past and are affected by factors beyond our control, including: steel inventories; changes in the productive capacity of U.S. domestic steel producers; international demand for raw materials used in steel production; rates of global economic growth, especially construction and infrastructure activity that requires significant amounts of steel; changes in the levels of economic activity in the U.S., China, India, Europe and other industrialized or developing countries; changes in China's emissions policies and environmental compliance enforcement practices; changes in production capacity of other iron ore suppliers, especially as additional supply comes online or where there is a significant increase in imports of steel into the U.S. or Europe; changes in trade laws; imposition or termination of duties, tariffs, import and export controls and other trade barriers impacting the iron ore markets; weather-related disruptions or natural disasters that may impact the global supply of iron ore; and the proximity, capacity and cost of infrastructure and transportation.\nOur earnings, therefore, may fluctuate with the prices of the product we sell and of the products our customers sell. To the extent that the prices of iron ore and steel, including the Platts 62% price, hot-rolled coil steel price, Atlantic Basin pellet premium, Platts international indexed freight rates and changes in specified PPI, including those for industrial commodities, fuel and steel, significantly decline for an extended period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. We also may have to take impairments on our long-lived assets and/or inventory. Sustained lower prices also could cause us to further reduce existing mineral reserves if certain reserves no longer can be economically mined or processed at prevailing prices. We may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues and may incur losses. These events could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf steelmakers use methods other than blast furnace production to produce steel or use other inputs, or if their blast furnaces shut down or otherwise reduce production, the demand for our current iron ore products may decrease.\nDemand for our iron ore products in North America is largely determined by the operating rates for the blast furnaces of steel companies. However, not all finished steel is produced by blast furnaces; finished steel also may be produced by other methods that use scrap steel, pig iron, HBI and DRI. North American producers also can produce steel using imported iron ore products, which may reduce or eliminate the need for domestic iron ore. Future environmental restrictions on the use of blast furnaces in North America also may reduce our customers\u2019 use of their blast furnaces. Maintenance of blast furnaces may require substantial capital expenditures and may cause prolonged outages, which may reduce demand for our pellets. Our customers may choose not to maintain, or may not have the resources necessary to maintain, their blast furnaces. If our customers use methods to produce steel that do not use domestic iron ore pellets or if environmental or maintenance issues occur, demand for our current iron ore products may decrease, which could affect adversely our sales, margins, profitability and cash flows.\nDue to economic conditions and volatility in commodity prices, or otherwise, our customers could approach us about modifying their supply agreements or fail to perform under such agreements, which could impact adversely our sales, margins, profitability and cash flows.\nAlthough we have long-term contractual commitments for a majority of our iron ore pellet sales, uncertainty in global economic conditions may impact adversely the ability of our customers to meet their obligations to us. As a result of such market volatility, our customers could approach us about modifying their supply agreements or fail to perform under such agreements. Considering our limited base of current and potential blast furnace customers, any modifications to our sales agreements or customers' failures to perform under such agreements could impact adversely our sales, margins, profitability and cash flows. For example, certain customers in the North American integrated steel industry have experienced financial difficulties from time-to-time, including going through reorganization proceedings. A loss of sales to our existing customers could have a substantial negative impact on our sales, margins, profitability and cash flows. Other potential actions by our customers could result in additional contractual disputes and could ultimately require arbitration or litigation, either of which could be time consuming and costly. Any such disputes and/or inability to renew existing contracts on favorable terms could impact adversely our sales, margins, profitability and cash flows.\nCapacity expansions and limited rationalization of supply capacity within the mining industry could lead to lower or more volatile global iron ore prices, impacting our profitability.\nGlobal growth of iron ore demand, particularly from China, and higher iron ore prices resulted in iron ore miners expanding their production capacity in recent years to increase iron ore supply. In the past, however, moderation in demand following increases in production capacity has resulted in excess supply of iron ore, causing downward pressure on prices. A return to supply capacity expansions could lead to pricing pressure which can have an adverse impact on our sales, margins, profitability and cash flows. We do not have control over corporate strategies implemented by other iron ore producers that may result in volatility of global iron ore prices.\nII.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which imposes, and will continue to impose, potential significant costs and liabilities on us. Future laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted and enforced could increase these costs and liabilities or limit our ability to produce iron ore products.\nNew laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, changes in the interpretation of MSHA regulations, such as workplace exam rules or safety around mobile equipment, changes in the interpretation of OSHA regulations, such as standards for occupational exposure to noise and certain chemicals, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from discontinued foreign operations, compliance costs and enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Act, and costs associated with the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated under these Acts and any replacements or amendments thereof. In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations for human health and safety, air quality, water pollution, plant, wetlands, natural resources and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, the effects that mining has on groundwater quality, conductivity and availability, and other related matters. Compliance with numerous governmental permits and approvals is required for our operations.\nWe cannot be certain that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations, permits and approvals. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations, permits or approvals, we could be\nfined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject imposes substantial costs on us, which could increase over time because of heightened regulatory oversight, adoption of more stringent environmental standards, and greater demand for remediation services leading to shortages of equipment, supplies and labor, as well as other factors.\nSpecifically, there are several notable proposed or recently enacted rulemakings or activities to which we would be subject or that would further regulate and/or tax our North American integrated steel producer customers, which may also require us or our customers to reduce or otherwise change operations significantly or incur significant additional costs, depending on their ultimate outcome. These emerging or recently enacted rules, regulations and policy guidance include, but are not limited to: trade regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and/or other trade agreements, treaties or policies; Minnesota's potential revisions to the sulfate wild rice water quality standard; evolving water quality standards for selenium and conductivity; scope of the Clean Water Act and the definition of \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d; Minnesota's Mercury TMDL and associated rules governing mercury air emission reductions; Climate Change and GHG Regulation; Regional Haze FIP Rule; NO2 and SO2 NAAQS; and increased administrative and legislative initiatives related to financial assurance obligations for CERCLA, mining and reclamation obligations. Such new or more stringent legislation, regulations, interpretations or orders, when enacted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or profitability.\nAlthough the numerous regulations, operating permits and our management systems mitigate potential impacts to the environment, our operations inadvertently may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use, and have used in the past, hazardous materials, and, from time to time, we have generated solid and hazardous waste. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims under federal, state and local laws and regulations for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, sediments, groundwater and other natural resources and reclamation of properties. Such claims for damages and reclamation may arise out of current or former conditions at sites that we own, lease or operate currently, as well as sites that we or our acquired companies have owned, leased or operated, and at contaminated sites that have been owned, leased or operated by our joint venture partners. Our liability for these claims may be strict, and/or joint and several, such that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for entire claims regardless of fault. We are currently subject to potential liabilities relating to investigation and remediation activities at certain sites. In addition to sites currently owned, leased or operated, these include sites where we formerly conducted raw material processing or other operations, inactive sites that we currently own, predecessor sites, acquired sites, leased land sites and third-party waste disposal sites. We may be named as a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future and we cannot be certain that the costs associated with these additional sites will not be material.\nWe also could be subject to litigation for alleged bodily injuries arising from claimed exposure to hazardous substances allegedly used, released, or disposed of by us. In particular, we and certain of our subsidiaries were involved in various claims relating to the exposure of asbestos and silica to seamen who sailed until the mid-1980s on the Great Lakes vessels formerly owned and operated by certain of our subsidiaries. While several hundred of these claims against us had been combined in a multidistrict litigation docket and have since been dismissed and/or settled for non-material amounts, there remains a possibility that similar types of claims could be filed in the future.\nEnvironmental impacts as a result of our operations, including exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect our margins, cash flow or profitability.\nWe may be unable to obtain and/or renew permits necessary for our operations or be required to provide additional financial assurance, which could reduce our production, cash flows, profitability and available liquidity. We also could face significant permit and approval requirements that could delay our commencement or continuation of new or existing production operations which, in turn, could affect materially our profitability and available liquidity.\nPrior to commencement of mining and periodically after production begins, we must submit to and obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory authority of plans showing where and how mining and reclamation operations are to occur. These plans must include information such as the location of mining areas, stockpiles, surface waters, haul roads, tailings basins and drainage from mining operations. Any requirements imposed by any such authority may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.\nMining and manufacturing companies must obtain numerous permits that impose strict conditions on various environmental and safety matters in connection with iron ore mining and production. These include permits issued by various federal, state and local agencies and regulatory bodies. The permitting rules are complex and may change over time, making our ability to comply with the applicable requirements more difficult or impractical and costly, possibly precluding the continuance of ongoing operations or the development of future operations. Interpretations of rules may also change over time and may lead to requirements, such as additional financial assurance, making it costlier to comply. The public, including special interest groups and individuals, have certain rights under various statutes to comment upon, submit objections to, and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizens\u2019 lawsuits to challenge such permits or activities. Accordingly, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion (or at all), or permits issued or renewed may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to conduct our mining and production activities efficiently, including the requirement for additional financial assurances that we may not be able to provide on commercially reasonable terms (or at all) and which would further limit our borrowing base under our ABL Facility. Such inefficiencies could reduce our production, cash flows, profitability or available liquidity.\nIII.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nA substantial majority of our sales are made under supply agreements with specified duration to a low number of customers that contain price-adjustment clauses that could adversely affect our profitability.\nA majority of our Mining and Pelletizing sales are made under supply agreements with specified durations to a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 99% of our revenues from product sales and services was derived from the North American integrated steel industry, and three customers together accounted for 97% of our Mining and Pelletizing product sales revenues. Our average remaining duration of our Mining and Pelletizing contracts as of December 31, 2019 is approximately five years. Pricing under our customer contracts is adjusted by certain factors, including Platts 62% price, hot-rolled coil steel price, Atlantic Basin pellet premium, Platts international indexed freight rates and changes in specified PPI, including those for industrial commodities, fuel and steel. As a result of these and other pricing constructs contained in our customer contracts, our financial results are sensitive to changes in iron ore and steel prices.\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business, which could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our senior notes and ABL Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2,238.0 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt outstanding, $400.0 million of which was secured (excluding $37.9 million of outstanding letters of credit and $38.2 million of finance leases), and $352.6 million of cash on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, no loans were drawn under the ABL Facility and we had total availability of $395.7 million as a result of borrowing base limitations. As of December 31, 2019, the principal amount of letters of credit obligations and other commitments totaled $37.9 million, thereby further reducing available borrowing capacity on our ABL Facility to $357.8 million.\nOur existing level of indebtedness requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic development initiatives, and other general corporate purposes. Moreover, our level of indebtedness could have further consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business, or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less indebtedness.\nAlthough we were successful in financing our HBI project, our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic development initiatives, and general corporate purposes. Our liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends and many other factors not within our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt. In addition, in connection with the consummation of the Merger, we expect to incur additional debt to, among other things, retire certain of AK Steel's existing debt and enter into the New ABL Facility. See \"-VII. Risks Related to the Proposed Merger-Following completion of the proposed Merger, our debt may limit our financial flexibility.\"\nAny failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.\nWe also have significant capital requirements, including interest payments to service our debt. If we incur significant losses in future periods, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may consider, among other options, restructuring our debt; however, there can be no assurance that these options will be undertaken and, if so undertaken, whether these efforts would succeed.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, including additional secured or unsecured debt, or restructure or refinance our debt. We may be unable to consummate any proposed asset sales or recover the carrying value of these assets, and any proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, making it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit or other financing, particularly during periods in which credit markets are weak. Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all, causing a change in our credit ratings; limiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we compete and general economic and market conditions. In addition, new or increased financial assurances may be demanded by our vendors or regulatory agencies that we may not be able to provide on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAny of these examples potentially could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, profitability, shareholders' equity and capital structure.\nA court or regulatory body could find that we are responsible, in whole or in part, for liabilities we transferred to third party purchasers.\nAs part of our strategy to protect our core business, we have sold or otherwise disposed of several non-core assets, such as our North American Coal and Australian assets. Some of the transactions under which we sold or otherwise disposed of our non-core assets included provisions transferring certain liabilities to the purchasers or acquirers of those non-core assets. While we believe that all such transfers were completed properly and are legally binding, if the purchaser fails to fulfill its obligations, we may be at risk that some court or regulatory body could disagree and determine that we remain responsible for liabilities we intended to and did transfer.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers depends on their creditworthiness.\nOur ability to receive payment for products sold and delivered to our customers depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Generally, we deliver our products to our customers\u2019 facilities in advance of payment for those products. Under this practice for most of our customers, title and risk of loss do not pass to the customer until we receive payment; however, there is typically a period of time in which our products, for which we have reserved title, are within our customers\u2019 control. Where we have identified credit risk with certain customers, we have put in place alternate payment terms from time to time.\nCustomers outside of the U.S. may be subject to pressures and uncertainties that may affect their ability to pay, including trade barriers, exchange controls, and local economic and political conditions. Downturns in the economy and disruptions in the global financial markets have affected the creditworthiness of our customers from time to time. Some of our customers are highly leveraged. If economic conditions worsen or prolonged global, national or regional economic recession conditions return, it is likely to impact significantly the creditworthiness of our customers and could, in turn, increase the risk we bear on payment default for the credit we provide to our customers and could limit our ability to collect receivables. Failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could affect adversely our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur operating expenses could increase significantly if the price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources increases.\nOur operations require significant use of energy. Energy expenses, which are approximately 15% to 25% of our total production costs, are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices, including diesel fuel and natural gas prices. Prices for electricity, natural gas and fuel oils can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed and we may not be able to purchase them at historical rates. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure, or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and affect adversely our operations. While we have some long-term contracts with electrical suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs. As an example, our United Taconite mine is subject to changes in Minnesota Power\u2019s rates, such as periodic rate changes that are reviewed and approved by the state public utilities commission in response to an application filed by Minnesota Power. We also enter into market-based pricing supply contracts for electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for use in our operations. Those contracts expose us to price increases in energy costs, which could cause our profitability to decrease significantly. In addition, U.S. public utilities may pass through additional capital and operating cost increases to their customers related to new or pending U.S. environmental regulations that may require significant capital investment and use of cleaner fuels in the future.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities.\nCredit rating agencies could downgrade our ratings due to various developments, including the Merger, factors specific to our business, a prolonged cyclical downturn in the mining or steel industry, or macroeconomic trends (such as global or regional recessions) and trends in credit and capital markets more generally. Any decline in our credit ratings may result in an increase to our cost of future financing and/or limit our access to the capital markets, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations, hinder our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities and may affect adversely the terms under which we purchase goods and services.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance, including that set forth under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Outlook\u201d in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, regarding our future performance. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The principal reason that we release such data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the further in the future that the data are forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks described in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K or our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nOur assets as of December 31, 2019 include a deferred tax asset, the full value of which we may not be able to realize.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2019, the net deferred tax asset was $459.5 million, primarily related to U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income. We believe the recorded net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2019 is fully realizable based on our expected future earnings. However, our assumptions and estimates are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and some of which may change. As a result, we could ultimately lose a portion of our deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards due to expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nHolders of our common shares may not receive dividends on their common shares.\nHolders of our common shares are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may from time to time declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Ohio and governed by the Ohio General Corporation Law, which allows a corporation to pay dividends, in general, in an amount that cannot exceed its surplus, as determined under Ohio law. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Additionally, our ABL Facility contains, and agreements governing any of our future debt (including the New ABL Facility) may contain, covenants and other restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit the level of dividends that we are able to pay on our common shares. Although we recently have declared cash dividends on our common shares, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common shares and our Board of Directors may reduce, defer or eliminate our common share dividend in the future.\nWe rely on our joint venture partners to meet their payment obligations and we are subject to risks involving the acts or omissions of our joint venture partners.\nWe co-own one of our four operating Mining and Pelletizing mines with ArcelorMittal USA and U.S. Steel. One of our joint venture partners is also our customer. We cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, and we have limited ability to control the joint venture because we hold a minority interest and no longer manage the joint venture. Accordingly, we rely on our joint venture partners to make their required capital contributions and to pay for their share of the iron ore produced. If one or both of our joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations, the remaining joint venture partners, including ourselves, may be required to assume additional material obligations, including significant capital contributions, costs of environmental remediation, and pension and OPEB obligations.\nIV.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nMine closures entail substantial costs. If we prematurely close one or more of our mines, our results of operations and financial condition would likely be affected adversely.\nIf we prematurely close any of our mines, our production and revenues would be reduced unless we were able to increase production at our other mines in an offsetting amount, which may not be possible. The closure of a mining operation involves significant fixed closure costs, including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance-related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs, and the costs of terminating long-term obligations, including customer, energy and transportation contracts and equipment leases. We base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies we perform from time to time, but those studies and assumptions are subject to uncertainties and estimates that may not be accurate. We recognize the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, tailings ponds, roads and other mining support areas based on the estimated mining life of our property. If we were to significantly reduce the estimated life of any of our mines, the mine-closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase costs per ton produced and could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA permanent mine closure could accelerate and significantly increase employment legacy costs, including our expense and funding costs for pension and OPEB obligations. A number of employees would be eligible for immediate retirement under special eligibility rules that apply upon a mine closure. All employees eligible for immediate retirement under the pension plans at the time of the permanent mine closure also could be eligible for OPEB, thereby accelerating our obligation to provide these benefits. Certain mine closures would precipitate a pension closure liability significantly greater than an ongoing operation liability and may trigger certain severance liability obligations.\nOur sales and competitive position depend on the ability to transport our products to our customers at competitive rates and in a timely manner.\nDisruption of the lake, rail and trucking transportation services because of weather-related problems, including ice and winter weather conditions on the Great Lakes or St. Lawrence Seaway, climate change, strikes, lock-outs, or other events and lack of alternative transportation options, could impair our ability to supply iron ore products to our customers at competitive rates or in a timely manner and, thus, could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Further, reduced dredging and environmental changes, particularly at Great Lakes ports, could impact negatively our ability to move our iron ore products because lower water levels restrict the tonnage that vessels can haul, resulting in higher freight rates.\nNatural disasters, weather conditions, disruption of energy, unanticipated geological conditions, equipment failures, and other unexpected events may lead our customers, our suppliers or our facilities to curtail production or shut down operations.\nOperating levels within our industry are subject to unexpected conditions and events that are beyond the industry\u2019s control. Those events could cause industry members or their suppliers to curtail production or shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce the demand for our iron ore products and affect adversely our sales, margins and profitability.\nInterruptions in production capabilities inevitably will increase our production costs and reduce our profitability. For example, we do not have meaningful excess capacity for current production needs, and we are not able to quickly increase production or restart production at one mine to offset an interruption in production at another mine. Additionally, restart production costs can be even higher if required to be taken during extremely cold weather conditions.\nA portion of our production costs are fixed regardless of current operating levels. As noted, our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay deliveries or increase the cost of production for varying lengths of time. These include weather conditions (for example, extreme winter weather, tornadoes, floods, and the lack of availability of process water due to drought) and natural and man-made disasters, tailings dam failures, pit wall failures, unanticipated geological conditions, including variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the deposits of iron ore, variations in rock and other natural materials, and variations in geologic conditions and ore processing changes.\nOur mining operations, ore processing facilities and logistics operations depend on critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failures. In addition, all of our mines and most of our processing facilities have been in operation for several decades, and the equipment is aged. In the future, we may experience additional lengthy shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of equipment failures. Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures that could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance would not cover all of the lost revenues associated with equipment failures. Longer-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our future sales levels and profitability.\nMany of our mines and facilities are dependent on one source for electric power and for natural gas. A significant interruption in service from our energy suppliers due to terrorism or sabotage, weather conditions, natural disasters, or any other cause could result in substantial losses that may not be fully recoverable, either from our business interruption insurance or responsible third parties.\nWe incur certain costs when production capacity is idled, including increased costs to resume production at idled facilities and costs to idle facilities.\nOur decisions concerning which facilities to operate and at what capacity levels are made based upon our customers' orders for products, as well as the quality, performance capabilities and production cost of our operations. During depressed market conditions, we may concentrate production at certain facilities and not operate others in response to customer demand, and as a result we may incur idle facility costs. In 2016, for example, two of our Minnesota mines were temporarily idled for a portion of the year, and we indefinitely idled the Empire mine in Michigan in August 2016.\nWhen we restart idled facilities, we incur certain costs to replenish inventories, prepare the previously idled facilities for operation, perform the required mine stripping, repair and maintenance activities, and prepare employees to return to work safely and to resume production responsibilities. The amount of any such costs can be material, depending on a variety of factors, such as the period of idle time, necessary repairs and available employees, and is difficult to project.\nIf faced with overcapacity in the iron ore market, we may seek to rationalize assets through asset sales, temporary shutdowns, indefinite idles or facility closures.\nWe may not have adequate insurance coverage for some business risks.\nAs noted above, our operations are generally subject to a number of hazards and risks, which could result in damage to, or destruction of, equipment, properties or facilities. The insurance that we maintain to address risks that are typical in our business may not provide adequate coverage. Insurance against some risks, such as liabilities for environmental pollution, tailings basin breaches, or certain hazards or interruption of certain business activities, may not be available at an economically reasonable cost, or at all. Even if available, we may self-insure where we determine it is most cost-effective to do so. As a result, accidents or other negative developments involving our mining, production or transportation activities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nA disruption in, or failure of our information technology systems, including those related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems for the operations of many of our business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. While we maintain some of our critical information technology systems, we are also dependent on third parties to provide important IT services relating to, among other things, operational technology at our facilities, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those related to cybersecurity, our systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters, or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Though we have controls in place, we cannot provide assurance that a cyber-attack will not occur. Furthermore, we may have little or no oversight with respect to security measures employed by third-party service providers, which may ultimately prove to be ineffective at countering threats. Failures of our IT systems, whether caused maliciously or inadvertently, may result in the disruption of our business processes, or in the unauthorized release of sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information, or result in the corruption of data, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against and, if required, remediate the damage caused by such disruptions or system failures in the future.\nOur profitability could be affected adversely by the failure of outside contractors and/or suppliers to perform.\nWe rely on outside companies to provide key services, including the design and construction of our HBI production plant in Toledo, Ohio. Additionally, we use contractors to help complete certain capital projects, such as upgrades to our existing Mining and Pelletizing facilities. A contractor's or supplier's failure to perform could affect adversely our production, sales, and our ability to fulfill customer requirements. Such failure to perform in a significant way would result in additional costs for us, which also could affect adversely our production rates, sales, results of operations and profitability.\nV.\nDEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY RISKS\nThe cost and time to implement a strategic capital project may prove to be greater than originally anticipated.\nWe undertake strategic capital projects, such as the HBI project, in order to enhance, expand or upgrade our mining and production capabilities or diversify our customer base. Our ability to achieve the anticipated production volumes, revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on strategic capital projects that we may undertake is subject to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control, including a variety of market (such as a volatile pricing environment for iron ore products), operational, permitting and labor-related factors. Further, the cost to implement any given strategic capital project ultimately may prove to be greater and may take more time than originally anticipated. Inability to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of our strategic capital projects, incurring unanticipated implementation costs or penalties, or the inability to meet contractual obligations could affect adversely our results of operations and future earnings and cash flow generation.\nWe continually must replace ore reserves depleted by production. Exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries.\nOur ability to replenish our ore reserves is important to our long-term viability. Depleted ore reserves must be\nreplaced by further delineation of existing ore bodies or by locating new deposits in order to maintain production levels over the long term. For example, in 2017 we made investments in our Tilden and Empire mines and in land in Minnesota to provide future potential ore reserves. Based on the economic reserve analyses performed during 2019 and 2018, we revised the mine plans for Tilden and Northshore, respectively, to add ore reserves and extend mine life. Resource exploration and development are highly speculative in nature. Exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably. Once a site with mineralization is discovered, it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures are required to establish recoverable proven and probable reserves and to construct mining and processing facilities. As a result, there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful, and there is a risk that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions.\nWe rely on estimates of our recoverable reserves, which is complex due to geological characteristics of the properties and the number of assumptions made.\nWe regularly evaluate our iron ore reserves based on revenues and costs and update them as required in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. We anticipate further updating our mining properties disclosure in accordance with the SEC's Final Rule 13-10570, Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, which became effective February 25, 2019, and which rescinds Industry Guide 7 following a two-year transition period, which means that we will be required to comply with the new rule no later than our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2021. Estimates of reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, some of which are beyond our control, such as production capacity, effects of regulations by governmental agencies, future prices for iron ore, future industry conditions and operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and costs of extraction and reclamation, all of which may vary considerably from actual results. Estimating the quantity and grade of reserves requires us to determine the size, shape and depth of our mineral bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of drill holes. In addition to the geology assumptions regarding our mines, assumptions are also required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves, including estimates of future commodity prices and demand, the mining methods we use, and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our reserves. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of mineralized deposits attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially as the criteria change. Estimated ore reserves could be affected by future industry conditions, future changes in the SEC's mining property disclosure requirements, geological conditions and ongoing mine planning. Actual volume and grade of reserves recovered, production rates, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and if such variances are material, our sales and profitability could be affected adversely.\nDefects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our mining properties could limit our ability to mine these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nA portion of our mining operations are conducted on properties we lease, license or as to which we have easements or other possessory interests, which we refer to as \"leased properties.\" Consistent with industry practice, title to most of these leased properties and mineral rights are not usually verified until we make a commitment to develop a property, which may not occur until after we have obtained necessary permits and completed exploration of the leased property. In some cases, title with respect to leased properties is not verified at all because we instead rely on title information or representations and warranties provided by lessors or grantors. We do not maintain title insurance on our owned or leased properties. A title defect or the loss of any lease, license or easement for any leased mining property could affect adversely our ability to mine any associated reserves. In addition, from time to time the rights of third parties for competing uses of adjacent, overlying, or underlying lands such as for roads, easements and public facilities may affect our ability to operate as planned if our title is not superior or arrangements cannot be negotiated.\nAny challenge to our title could delay the exploration and development of some reserves, deposits or surface rights, cause us to incur unanticipated costs and could ultimately result in the loss of some or all of our interest in those reserves or surface rights. In the event we lose reserves, deposits or surface rights, we may have to shut down or significantly alter the sequence of our mining operations, which may affect adversely our future production, revenues and cash flows. Additionally, if we lose any leasehold interests relating to any of our pellet plants or loadout facilities, we may need to find an alternative location to process our iron ore and load it for delivery to customers, which could result in significant unanticipated costs. Finally, we could incur significant liability if we inadvertently mine on property we do not own or lease.\nIn order to continue to foster growth in our business and maintain stability of our earnings, we must maintain our social license to operate with our stakeholders.\nMaintaining a strong reputation and consistent operational and safety track record is vital in order to continue to foster growth and maintain stability in our earnings. As sustainability expectations increase and regulatory requirements continue to evolve, maintaining our social license to operate becomes increasingly important. We incorporate social license expectations in our ERM program. Our ability to maintain our reputation and strong operating track record could be threatened, including by circumstances outside of our control, such as disasters caused or suffered by other companies in our industry. If we are not able to respond effectively to these and other challenges to our social license to operate, our reputation could be damaged significantly. Damage to our reputation could affect adversely our operations and ability to foster growth projects.\nEstimates and timelines relating to new development projects are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated.\nMining industry development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and/or start-up.\nOur decision to develop a project typically is based on the results of feasibility studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others: changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore or other raw materials to be mined and processed; estimated future prices of the relevant product; changes in customer demand; higher construction and infrastructure costs; the quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made; higher production costs; adverse geotechnical conditions; availability of adequate labor force; availability and cost of water and energy; availability and cost of transportation; fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates; availability and terms of financing; delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or changes in laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations; weather or severe climate impacts; and potential delays relating to social and community issues.\nOur HBI project will require the commitment of substantial resources. Any unanticipated costs or delays associated with our HBI project could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ongoing efforts with respect to our HBI project require the commitment of substantial capital expenditures. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures through 2020 of approximately $830 million plus a contingency of up to 20%, excluding capitalized interest, on the development of the HBI production plant in Toledo, Ohio, of which approximately $700 million was paid as of December 31, 2019. Our estimated expenses may increase as personnel and equipment associated with advancing development and commercial production are added. The timely completion and successful commercial startup of the HBI project will depend in part on the following:\n\u2022\nmaintaining required federal, state and local permits;\n\u2022\ncompleting construction work, commissioning and integration of all of the systems comprising our HBI production plant;\n\u2022\nnegotiating sales contracts for our planned production; and\n\u2022\nother factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nAny unanticipated costs or delays associated with our HBI project could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and could require us to seek additional capital, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nVI.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RISKS\nOur profitability could be affected adversely if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nProduction in our mines and processing facilities is dependent upon the efforts of our employees. We are party to labor agreements with various labor unions that represent employees at some of our operations. Such labor agreements are negotiated periodically, and, therefore, we are subject to the risk that these agreements may not be able to be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms. It is difficult to predict what issues may arise as part of the collective bargaining process, and whether negotiations concerning these issues will be successful. Due to union activities or other employee actions,\nwe could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in our production of iron ore that could affect us adversely. The USW represents all hourly employees at United Taconite and Tilden mines. Our labor agreements with the USW were ratified in October 2018 and extended for a four-year term, effective as of October 1, 2018.\nIf we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors or fail to come to an agreement upon expiry, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may encounter labor shortages for critical operational positions, which could affect adversely our ability to produce our products.\nWe are predicting a long-term shortage of skilled workers for the mining and metals processing industries, and competition for the available workers limits our ability to attract and retain employees as well as engage third-party contractors. As our experienced employees retire, we may have difficulty replacing them at competitive wages.\nOur expenditures for pension and OPEB obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions differ from actual outcomes, there are mine closures, or our joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations that relate to employee pension plans.\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans and OPEB to certain eligible union and non-union employees, including our share of expense and funding obligations with respect to our unconsolidated joint venture. Our pension and OPEB expenses and our required contributions to our pension and OPEB plans are affected directly by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted.\nWe cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will increase our pension and OPEB expenses or our funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.\nWe have calculated our unfunded pension and OPEB obligations based on a number of assumptions. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, we cannot be certain that regulatory changes will not increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. These obligations also may increase substantially in the event of adverse medical cost trends or unexpected rates of early retirement, particularly for bargaining unit retirees.\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of these employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the global economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense. We must continue to recruit, retain, and motivate our senior management and key personnel in order to maintain our business and support our projects. A loss of senior management and key personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nVII.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED MERGER\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe adoption of the Merger Agreement by AK Steel stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe approval by our shareholders of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the issuance of our common shares in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe receipt of required regulatory approval in Mexico;\n\u2022\nthe absence of any governmental order or law prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of our and AK Steel\u2019s respective representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement);\n\u2022\nthe performance by us and AK Steel of our respective obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; and\n\u2022\nthe absence of a material adverse effect (as described in the Merger Agreement) on us or AK Steel.\nThese conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or may not be completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed by June 30, 2020 (subject to the parties each being entitled to extend the date to September 30, 2020 and then December 31, 2020 if required antitrust approvals have not yet been obtained or there is an impediment under any antitrust law), either party may choose not to proceed with the Merger. The parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after the receipt of AK Steel stockholder approval or our shareholder approval.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the price of our common shares as well as our future business and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including the failure of our shareholders to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the issuance of our common shares in connection with the Merger, or the failure of AK Steel stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement, our business and financial results may be adversely affected, including as follows:\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of our common shares;\n\u2022\nthe manner in which customers, vendors, business partners and other third parties perceive us may be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect our ability to compete for new business or obtain renewals in the marketplace more broadly;\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from employees, which may adversely affect, among other things, productivity and occupational safety; and\n\u2022\nwe will have expended significant time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on our existing businesses and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us, and our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay AK Steel a termination fee.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause our suppliers, customers and others that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. For example, our steelmaking customers may not want to purchase their iron ore from a company that is also a competitor.\nThe Merger may be less accretive than expected, or may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common shares.\nThe Merger may be less accretive than expected, or may be dilutive, to our earnings per share. Estimates of our earnings per share in the future are based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in market conditions;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices for iron ore and steel;\n\u2022\nproduction levels;\n\u2022\noperating results;\n\u2022\ncompetitive conditions;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations affecting the iron ore and steel businesses;\n\u2022\ncapital expenditure obligations;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected integration costs;\n\u2022\nlower than expected synergies; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAny dilution of, or decrease or delay of any accretion to, our earnings per share could cause the price of our common shares to decline.\nWe will incur significant transaction and Merger-related costs in connection with the Merger, which may be in excess of those anticipated by us.\nWe expect to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with completing the Merger, combining the operations of the two companies and achieving anticipated synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the Merger and include, among others, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, employee retention costs, severance, change of control and benefit costs, and filing fees.\nWe will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We will continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.\nThe costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results following the completion of the Merger.\nMany of these costs will be borne by us even if the Merger is not completed.\nFollowing completion of the proposed Merger, our debt may limit our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We expect to incur and/or assume approximately $2.2 billion of debt to complete the acquisition of AK Steel. If we seek to refinance our and/or AK Steel\u2019s existing indebtedness, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to execute the refinancing on favorable terms or at all. In addition, in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, we obtained commitments to provide debt financing in an amount sufficient to repay AK Steel\u2019s outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility as well as AK Steel\u2019s outstanding senior secured notes. Although the receipt of such financing is not a condition to the closing of the Merger, the unavailability of such financing could adversely impact the financial condition and liquidity of the combined company.\nAssuming we do not repay, repurchase, redeem, exchange or otherwise terminate any of our or AK Steel\u2019s existing indebtedness, immediately following the completion of the Merger, we expect to have approximately $4.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness.\nAny increase in our indebtedness could have adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.\nIn addition, in connection with executing our business strategies following the Merger, we expect to continue to evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional assets and making further strategic investments, and we may elect to finance these endeavors by incurring additional indebtedness.\nOur ability to arrange any additional financing for the purposes described above or otherwise will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe or AK Steel are the target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies when companies enter into agreements for transactions similar to those contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and such lawsuits have been brought against us or AK Steel in connection with the Merger Agreement. For example, several such lawsuits have been filed against AK Steel and its directors and are currently pending. Two such lawsuits have also named us as a defendant, and another lawsuit has been filed against us and our directors (refer to Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information on these lawsuits). Even if the lawsuits are without merit, these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nEven if we complete the Merger, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed Merger, and our integration with AK Steel may not be as successful as anticipated.\nThe success of the proposed Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our businesses with AK Steel\u2019s businesses. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of the proposed Merger may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as with respect to anticipated operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies; significant long-term cash flow generation; and the benefits of being a vertically integrated value-added iron ore and steel producing enterprise, may not be realized. In addition, there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Merger and/or AK Steel\u2019s businesses that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence.\nThe Merger involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other functions, systems and management controls that must be integrated. Difficulties in integrating the two companies may result in the combined company performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Following completion of the Merger, we may also experience challenges associated with managing the larger, more complex, integrated businesses. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nFollowing completion of the proposed Merger, the market price of our common shares may decline in the future as a result of the sale of our common shares held by former AK Steel stockholders or our current shareholders.\nWe expect to issue approximately 133 million of our common shares to AK Steel stockholders in the Merger (including shares underlying AK Steel equity awards expected to be outstanding at the effective time of the Merger, which will be converted into awards with respect to our common shares). Following their receipt of our common shares as merger consideration, former AK Steel stockholders may seek to sell our common shares delivered to them. Other shareholders may also seek to sell our common shares held by them following, or in anticipation of, completion of the Merger. These sales (or the perception that these sales may occur), coupled with the increase in the outstanding number of our common shares, may affect the market for, and the market price of, our common shares in an adverse manner.\nFollowing completion of the proposed Merger, we may record tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill, that could become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations in the future.\nThe Merger will be accounted for as an acquisition by us in accordance with GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of AK Steel and its subsidiaries will be recorded, as of completion of the Merger, at their respective fair values and added to our assets and liabilities. Our reported financial condition and results of operations for periods after completion of the Merger will reflect AK Steel balances and results after completion of the\nMerger but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of AK Steel and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to AK Steel\u2019s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the Merger. The excess, if any, of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. To the extent the value of tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. Our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.\nThe ability to use AK Steel\u2019s and our respective pre-Merger net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIf a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC, the corporation\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes arising before the \u201cownership change\u201d are subject to limitations after the \u201cownership change.\u201d An \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the IRC generally occurs if one or more shareholders or groups of shareholders who own at least 5% of the corporation\u2019s equity increase their ownership in the aggregate by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling period that begins on the later of three years prior to the testing date and the date of the last \u201cownership change.\u201d If an \u201cownership change\u201d were to occur, Section 382 of the IRC would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes the corporation could use to reduce its taxable income, potentially increasing and accelerating the corporation\u2019s liability for income taxes, and also potentially causing tax attributes to expire unused. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on a corporation\u2019s value immediately prior to the ownership change.\nAs of December 31, 2018, AK Steel had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.2 billion and approximately $89.2 million in deferred tax assets for state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The Merger likely will result in an \u201cownership change\u201d with respect to AK Steel. Accordingly, all or a portion of AK Steel\u2019s U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes likely would be subject to limitations (or disallowance) on their use after the Merger. Similar rules with respect to the state net operating loss carryforwards may apply under state tax laws.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.1 billion and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.5 billion. Our ability to utilize the $2.1 billion U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the IRC. Similar rules with respect to the $1.5 billion state net operating loss carryforwards may apply under state tax laws. The issuance of our common shares to AK Steel stockholders in the Merger or in connection with other issuances or sales of our common shares (including certain transactions involving our common shares that are outside of our control) could cause an \u201cownership change\u201d.\nSubsequent \u201cownership changes\u201d may further affect the limitation in future years, and similar rules may also apply under state and foreign tax laws. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability following the Merger, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of AK Steel\u2019s or our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, which, in addition to increasing our U.S. federal income tax liability, could adversely affect our share price, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompletion of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which AK Steel is a party.\nThe completion of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which AK Steel is a party and to which the combined company will be subject following the Merger. If we are unable to obtain consents to the Merger from the counterparties or negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, which may include terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we are able to obtain consents or negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require consideration for granting such consents or waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to us.", "PERMNO": 27422, "SIC": 1000, "TIC": "CLF"}
