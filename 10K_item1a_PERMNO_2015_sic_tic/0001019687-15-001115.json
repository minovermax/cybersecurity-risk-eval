Risk Factors\nRisk Factors That May Affect Our Business\nOur financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control. These risks may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We urge investors to carefully consider the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report:\nWe may not be able to compete effectively within the highly competitive and evolving interactive games, entertainment and marketing services industries.\nWe face intense competition in the markets in which we operate. We face significant competition for entertainment and marketing services in hospitality venues from other companies offering similar content and services. Our services also compete with games, apps and other forms of entertainment offerings available directly to consumers on their smart phones and tablets. See \u201cBusiness-Competition.\u201d Some of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, including greater financial resources for competitive activities, such as content development and programming, research and development, strategic acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and sales and marketing. As a result, our current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or consumer preferences.\nThe increased availability of the internet and wireless networks provides consumers with an increasing number of alternatives to our entertainment offerings. With this increasing competition and the rapid pace of change in product and service offerings, we must be able to compete in terms of technology, content, and management strategy. If we fail to provide competitive, engaging, quality services and products, we will lose revenues to competing companies and technologies. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles, reduced revenues, and loss of market share.\nNew products and rapid technological change, especially in the mobile and wireless markets, may render our operations obsolete or noncompetitive.\nThe emergence of new entertainment products and technologies, changes in consumer preferences, the adoption of new industry standards, and other factors may limit the life cycle and market penetration of our technologies, products, and services. In particular, the mobile and wireless device, content, applications, social media, and entertainment markets are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Accordingly, our future performance will depend on our ability to:\n\u00b7 identify emerging technological trends and industry standards in our market;\n\u00b7 identify changing consumer needs, desires, or tastes;\n\u00b7 develop and maintain competitive technology, including new hardware and content products and service offerings;\n\u00b7 improve the performance, features, and reliability of our existing products and services, particularly in response to changes in consumer preferences, technological changes, and competitive offerings; and\n\u00b7 bring technology to the market quickly at cost-effective prices.\nIf we do not compete successfully in developing new products and keep pace with rapid technological change, we will be unable to achieve profitability or sustain a meaningful market position.\nWe may not be successful in developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments, changing customer needs, and consumer preferences. We may have to incur substantial costs to modify or adapt our products or services to respond to these developments, customer needs, and changing preferences. We must be able to incorporate new technologies into the products we design and develop in order to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base. Any significant delay or failure in developing new or enhanced technology, including new product and service offerings, could result in a loss of actual or potential market share and a decrease in revenues.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues from Buffalo Wild Wings corporate-owned restaurants and its franchisees, and any decrease in the amount of their business could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, Buffalo Wild Wings corporate-owned restaurants and its franchisees accounted for approximately 44%, or $11,438,000, of our total revenue. As of that date, approximately $1,558,000 was included in accounts receivable, all of which was received by February 2015. If Buffalo Wild Wings, a significant number of its franchisees, or any other customer who may in the future represent a significant portion of our revenue, breach or terminate their subscriptions or otherwise decrease the amount of business they transact with us, we could lose a significant portion of our revenues and cash flow.\nA disruption in the supply of equipment could negatively impact our subscriptions and revenue.\nThe BEOND tablet is currently manufactured by one unaffiliated third party, and we currently do not have an alternative manufacturing source for, or an alternative device to, the tablet. We purchase the BEOND tablets from various unaffiliated third parties, and we purchase each piece of the BEOND tablet equipment (consisting of tablet case components and tablet charging trays) from a different unaffiliated third party with respect to each piece of equipment. A different third party assembles the tablet cases. We currently do not have an alternative supply source for the tablet equipment or an alternative tablet case assembler.\nIf the sole manufacturer of the tablet or any of our sole suppliers or our sole tablet case assembler is delayed in delivering the tablets and related equipment to us, become unavailable, have product quality issues, or shortages occur, we may be unable to timely obtain replacement equipment. For example, during 2014, we encountered challenges with the assembly of the cases for our BEOND tablet, which prevented us from delivering and installing new systems within the time frame requested by customers, thereby creating a backlog. As of December 31, 2014, customer subscription agreements worth approximately $1,416,000 were affected by the backlog. We determined the worth of such agreements based on the sum of the annualized amount of the subscription fees, which is recognized as revenue as the service is provided, and the amount of equipment lease revenue, if any, subject to such agreements, which is recognized as revenue upon installation. As of March 24, 2015, the worth of agreements affected by the backlog was approximately $2,723,000. Although our current backlog is higher than our backlog at December 31, 2014, we believe we will reduce or eliminate the backlog related to case assembly issues during 2015, however, no assurances can be given in that regard and that challenge could continue or other challenges could arise, including challenges related to transitioning to new versions of the tablet that may require different cases, charging trays or other equipment. Delays, unavailability of equipment, product quality issues and shortages could hurt our reputation and customer loyalty, cause subscription cancellations and reduce our revenue.\nIf our manufacturers and/or suppliers were to go out of business or otherwise become unable to meet our needs for reliable equipment, the process of locating and qualifying alternate sources could take months, during which time our production could be delayed, and may, in some cases, require us to redesign our products and systems. Such delays and potentially costly re-sourcing and redesign could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property or we are subjected to intellectual property claims by others, our business could be seriously damaged.\nWe rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We have a small number of patents and patent applications pending in jurisdictions related to our business activities. Our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved. Moreover, our patents might not provide us with competitive advantages. Third parties might challenge our patents or trademarks or attempt to use infringing technologies or brands which could harm our ability to compete and reduce our revenues, as well as create significant litigation expense. In addition, patents and trademarks held by third parties might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and could likewise result in significant litigation expense. Furthermore, third parties might independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or, to the extent patents are issued to us, design around those patents. Others may have filed and, in the future may file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours. Such third-party patent applications might have priority over our patent applications. To determine the priority of inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us.\nWe believe that the success of our business also depends on such factors as the technical expertise and innovative capabilities of our employees. It is our policy that all employees and consultants sign non-disclosure agreements and assignment of invention agreements. Our competitors, former employees, and consultants may, however, misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours. Our competitors may also challenge or circumvent our proprietary rights. If we have to initiate or defend against an infringement claim to protect our proprietary rights, the litigation over any such claim could be time-consuming and costly to us, adversely affecting our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we hire or retain employees or consultants who may have worked for other companies developing products similar to those that we offer. These other companies may claim that our products are based on their products and that we have misappropriated their intellectual property. Any such claim could cause us to incur substantial costs, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may be liable for the content and services we make available on our Buzztime network and the internet.\nWe make content and entertainment services available on our Buzztime network and the internet which includes games and game content, software, and a variety of other entertainment content. The availability of this content and services and our branding could result in claims against us based on a variety of theories, including defamation, obscenity, negligence, or copyright or trademark infringement. We could also be exposed to liability for third-party content accessed through the links from our websites to other websites. Federal laws may limit, but not eliminate, our liability for linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with certain statutory requirements. We may incur costs to defend against claims related to either our own content or that of third parties, and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are found liable for information that we make available. Implementing measures to reduce our exposure may require us to spend substantial resources and may limit the attractiveness of our services to users which would impair our profitability and harm our business operations.\nOur cash flow may not cover our capital needs and we may need to raise additional funds in the future. Such funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all and, if available, may dilute current stockholders.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to generate cash from operating activities;\n\u00b7 acceptance of, and demand for, our interactive games and entertainment;\n\u00b7 the costs of continuing to develop and implement our BEOND technology platform and product line;\n\u00b7 the costs of developing new entertainment content, products, or technology or expanding our offering to new media platforms such as the internet and mobile phones;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we invest in the creation of new entertainment content and new technology; and\n\u00b7 the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions, if any.\nIn addition, in order to fully execute on our long-term strategic initiatives discussed above under the section entitled \u201cOur Strategy,\u201d we believe we will likely require additional funding.\nIf we need to raise additional funds in the future, such funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to continue to develop and implement our BEOND technology platform and product line, develop or enhance our other products and services, successfully execute our business plan or any or all of our strategic initiatives, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.\nWe have experienced significant losses, and we may incur significant losses in the future.\nWe have a history of significant losses, including net losses of $5,030,000 and $1,053,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and have an accumulated deficit of $117,845,000 as of December 31, 2014. We may also incur future operating and net losses, due in part to expenditures required to continue to implement our business strategies, including the continued development and implementation of our BEOND technology platform and product line. Despite significant expenditures, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Moreover, even if we do achieve profitability, the level of any profitability cannot be predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nWe may not be able to significantly grow our subscription revenue and implement our other business strategies.\nOur success depends on our ability to increase market awareness and encourage the adoption of the Buzztime brand and our Buzztime network among hospitality venues such as restaurants, sports bars, taverns and pubs, and within the interactive game player community. Our success also depends on our ability to improve customer retention. We may not be able to leverage our resources to expand awareness of and demand for our Buzztime network. In addition, our efforts to improve our game platform and content may not succeed in generating additional demand for our products or in strengthening the loyalty and retention of our existing customers. The degree of market adoption of our Buzztime network will depend on many factors, including consumer preferences, the availability and quality of competing products and services, and our ability to leverage our brand.\nOur success also depends on our ability to implement our other business strategies, which include developing our BEOND platform that allows for consumer play across the digital platform, developing more premium products that allow us to grow the revenue stream directly from consumers, developing dynamic menuing and point-of-sale, or POS, integration competency, and growing our marketing services and sponsorship revenues. Implementing these strategies will require us to dedicate significant resources to, among other things, fully developing and implementing our BEOND technology platform and product line, expanding our other product offerings, customizing our products and services to meet the unique needs of select accounts, and expanding and improving our marketing services and promotional efforts. We may be unable to implement these strategies as currently planned.\nOur products and services are subject to government regulations that may restrict our operations or cause demand for our products to decline significantly.\nIn addition to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply specifically to the the interactive entertainment and product marketing industries. In addition, we operate games of chance and, in some instances, award prizes. These games are regulated in many jurisdictions and the laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. See \u201cITEM 1. BUSINESS-Government Regulations.\u201d\nWe may find it necessary to eliminate, modify, suspend, or cancel certain features of our products (including the games we offer) in certain jurisdictions based on the adoptions of new laws and regulations or changes in law or regulations or the enforcement thereof, which could result in additional development costs and/or the loss of customers and revenue.\nCommunication or other system failures could result in the cancellation of subscribers and a decrease in our revenues.\nWe rely on continuous operation of our information technology and communications systems, and those of a variety of third parties, to communicate with and to distribute our services to the locations of our Buzztime network subscribers. We currently transmit our data to our customers via broadband internet connections including telephone and cable TV networks. Both our communications systems and those of third parties on which we rely are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, storms, fires, power loss, telecommunications and other network failures, equipment failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service or other attacks, and other causes. These systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, vandalism, and to other disruptions, for example if we or the operators of these systems and system facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our system protections and disaster recovery plans cannot prevent all outages, errors, or data losses. In addition, our services and systems are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or other vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, damage to or failure of our systems, any natural or man-made disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our facilities or those of a third party, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service to our customers, which could reduce our revenues and cash flow, and damage our brand. Any interruption in communications or failure of proper hardware or software function at our or our customers\u2019 venues could also decrease customer loyalty and satisfaction and result in a cancellation of our services.\nOur management turnover creates uncertainties.\nWe have experienced significant changes in our senior management team over the past several years. For example, Ram Krishnan was appointed as our chief executive officer in September 2014, and before he was appointed, we had three different individuals and an interim committee serve as our chief executive officer or perform the functions of a chief executive between February 2009 and September 2014. Because of our recent financial and stock performance, geographic location, and other business factors in a relatively small industry, we face substantial challenges in attracting and retaining experienced senior executives. Changes in senior management are inherently disruptive, and efforts to implement any new strategic or operating goals may not succeed in the absence of a long-term management team. Changes to strategic or operating goals with the appointment of new executives may themselves prove to be disruptive. Periods of transition in senior management leadership are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations and due to cultural differences and friction that may result from changes in strategy and style. Without consistent and experienced leadership, our employees, customers, creditors, stockholders, and others may lose confidence in us.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit and retain skilled professionals for our business.\nOur business requires experienced programmers, creative designers, application developers, and sales and marketing personnel. Our success will depend on identifying, hiring, training, and retaining such experienced and knowledgeable professionals. We must recruit and retain talented professionals in order for our business to grow. There is significant competition for the individuals with the skills required to develop the products and perform the services we offer. We may be unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future to sustain and grow our business, and we may not be successful in motivating and retaining the individuals we are able to attract. If we cannot attract, motivate, and retain qualified technical and sales and marketing professionals, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will suffer.\nWe may face exposure on sales and use taxes in various states.\nFrom time to time, state and provincial tax authorities have made inquiries as to whether or not a portion of our services might require the collection of sales and use taxes from customers in those jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions are expanding their interpretation of their sales and use tax statutes to subject more activities to tax. While in the past, the sales and use tax assessments we have paid have not had a significant adverse effect on our operations, such assessments may increase in the future and could adversely affect our operations.\nWe have incurred significant net operating loss carryforwards that we will likely be unable to use.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal income tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $59.7 million, which begin to expire in 2017. As of December 31, 2014, we had state income tax NOL carryforwards of approximately $25.5 million, portions of which will continue expiring in 2015. We believe that our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards may be substantially restricted by the passage of time and the limitations of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which apply when there are certain changes in ownership of a corporation. To the extent we begin to realize significant taxable income, these Section 382 limitations may result in our incurring federal income tax liability notwithstanding the existence of otherwise available NOL carryforwards. We have established a full valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets, including the NOL carryforwards, since we do not believe we are likely to generate future taxable income to realize these assets.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and incidents.\nOur business involves storing and transmitting payment information of our customers and certain personal information of consumers (such as their name, date of birth, and email address). In the future, we may store and transmit additional personal information of consumers, particularly as the services of the BEOND platform become more advanced to include POS integration. While we have implemented measures designed to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, any failure of these measures and/or any material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, system downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, trade barriers and other risks associated with operating our business in foreign countries could harm our business.\nWe operate the Buzztime network in the U.S. and in Canada. Since service fees and operating expenses from our Canadian subsidiary are recognized in its local currency, our financial position and results of operations could be significantly affected by large fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in Canada. To the extent we attempt to expand our sales efforts in other international markets, we may also face difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer payment cycles, problems with collecting accounts receivable, increased risks of piracy, and limits on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to adequately address the risks of doing business abroad, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe could become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements as we introduce features in direct payments from patrons.\nTo the extent we expand features and functionality to our BEOND platform that involve us accepting credit card and other forms of payments directly from patrons, we anticipate that we could experience risks associated with becoming subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including compliance with payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers) and fraud. Compliance with additional regulations and requirements may be difficult for us or even impossible; thereby limiting or prohibiting our ability to grow the amount of revenue we receive directly from patrons. In addition, if we become subject to these additional regulations and requirements, if we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card and debit card payments from patrons.\nRisks Relating to the Market for Our Common Stock\nOur common stock could be delisted or suspended from trading on the NYSE MKT if we fail to maintain compliance with continued listing criteria.\nThe NYSE MKT will normally consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities selling for a substantial period of time at a low price per share if the issuer fails to effect a reverse split of such stock within a reasonable time after being notified that NYSE MKT deems such action to be appropriate under the circumstances. While the NYSE MKT does not provide bright line minimum share price standards for continued listing, we believe that a price less than $1.00 per share for a substantial period of time may be investigated. Our common stock has traded below $1.00 per share since July 2007.\nIn addition, the NYSE MKT will normally consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer which has stockholders' equity of less than $6,000,000 if such issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. Although our stockholders' equity was more than $6,000,000 as of December 31, 2014, we had losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in each of our five most recent fiscal years.\nIf we are unable to comply with the NYSE MKT continued listing requirements our common stock may be suspended from trading on and/or delisted from the NYSE MKT. Alternatively, in order to avoid delisting for having a low trading price for a substantial period, we may be required to effect a reverse split of our common stock. The delisting of our common stock for whatever reason may materially impair our stockholders' ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the anticipation of such sales could have a material adverse effect on then-prevailing market prices.\nIn a private placement we completed in November 2013, we issued 6,000,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 3,600,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share. A registration statement registering the resale of all of those shares is currently effective and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such registration statement continuously effective until all such registered shares have been sold.\nIn addition, since 2009, in connection with acquisitions, we issued (directly or upon the exercise of warrants issued in connection with such acquisitions) an aggregate of approximately 2,798,000 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, there were outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,600,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.40 to $1.50 per share (including the warrants to purchase 3,600,000 shares we issued in our November 2013 private placement). In addition, as of December 31, 2014, there were 156,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. The holders of such shares may elect to convert them into shares of our common stock at any time. Based on the current conversion price, we would issue approximately 484,000 shares of our common stock if all of the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock were so converted. Generally, all of the shares of common stock we issued in connection with the acquisitions, the shares we may issue upon exercise of warrants and the shares of common stock we may issue upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock may be sold under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, subject to any applicable holding period with respect to the shares issued upon exercise of warrants the exercise price of which is paid with cash.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were also approximately 7,222,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at exercise prices ranging from $0.14 to $3.33 per share. A registration statement registering such shares of common stock is currently effective.\nAccordingly, a significant number of shares of our common stock could be sold at any time. Depending upon market liquidity at the time our common stock is resold by the holders thereof, such resales could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing. To the extent the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any of our outstanding options or warrants exceeds their exercise price, such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may restrict our operations.\nWe may raise additional capital at any time and may do so through one or more financing alternatives, including public or private sales of equity or debt securities directly to investors or through underwriters or placement agents. For example, in April 2014, we sold 12,765,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering. We currently have a shelf registration statement on file under which we could sell up to approximately $18 million worth of securities. Raising capital through the issuance of common stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock) may depress the market price of our stock and may substantially dilute our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may issue preferred stock with rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the holders of our common stock. Debt financings could involve covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens or make investments and may, among other things, preclude us from making distributions to stockholders (either by paying dividends or redeeming stock) and taking other actions beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, investors could impose more one-sided investment terms and conditions on companies that have or are perceived to have limited remaining funds or limited ability to raise additional funds. The lower our cash balance, the more difficult it is likely to be for us to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur charter contains provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in control of our company, which could result in our inability to approve a change in control and potentially receive a premium over the current market value of your stock.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if such a change in control would benefit our stockholders, or to make changes in our board of directors. For example, our certificate of incorporation (i) prohibits stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent, and (ii) requires a supermajority vote of at least 80% of the total voting power of our outstanding shares, voting together as a single class, to remove our directors from office or to amend provisions relating to stockholders taking action by written consent or calling special stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, our certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Some of these provisions:\n\u00b7 authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u00b7 prohibit our stockholders from making certain changes to our bylaws except with 66 2/3% stockholder approval; and\n\u00b7 require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nThese provisions could discourage third parties from taking control of our company. Such provisions may also impede a transaction in which you could receive a premium over then current market prices and your ability to approve a transaction that you consider in your best interest.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 76963, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "NTN"}
