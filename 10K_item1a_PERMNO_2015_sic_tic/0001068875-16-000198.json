Risk Factors\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION\nAs a result of the HD Vest Acquisition, we may face significant disruptions, business conflicts, inefficiencies, and other related risks.\nOn October 14, 2015, we announced that Blucora had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HDV Holdings, Inc., the holding company for the group of companies that comprise the Wealth Management business, for $611.9 million, including cash acquired and subject to adjustments (the \u201cHD Vest Acquisition\u201d). For further discussion of the terms of the HD Vest Acquisition, see the \"Strategic Transformation\" section in Part II Item 7 and \"Note 3: Business Combinations\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this annual report. We expect to face certain risks in connection with the HD Vest Acquisition, including the following:\n\u2022\nUncertainty and disruptions may negatively impact HD Vest\u2019s relationships with its employees, its financial advisors, or those advisors\u2019 relationships with their clients, which could materially harm HD Vest's financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the HD Vest Acquisition (including the expected operational, revenue, and cost synergies with our Tax Preparation business and the level of revenue and profitability growth that we are expecting), whether attributable to regulatory limitations, operational realities, or otherwise;\n\u2022\nWe may face difficulties, including loss of key employees, disruptions in our ongoing operations, and diversion of our and HD Vest\u2019s management\u2019s attention from ongoing operations and opportunities, in integrating the operations, technologies, products, services, IT systems, controls, and policies and procedures of HD Vest and in upgrading our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to incorporate the HD Vest operations;\n\u2022\nThe failure to retain key management responsible for the operations of HD Vest could materially and adversely impact those operations, particularly due to the fact that our management team at the corporate level lacks significant experience in the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nEven if we retain HD Vest\u2019s key management and other employees, we will need to attract and retain additional management resources to continue implementing our change in strategy to a company focused on the technology-enabled financial solutions market;\n\u2022\nThe market for the financial advisors upon whom HD Vest relies is extremely competitive, and failing to retain these individuals would undermine the anticipated benefits of the HD Vest Acquisition, and could also significantly increase our recruiting and retention costs;\n\u2022\nOur management\u2019s attention may be diverted from the daily operations of our existing businesses and from the execution of our plans to divest the InfoSpace and Monoprice businesses;\n\u2022\nOur financial results may be materially and adversely impacted by cash expenses and non-cash charges incurred in connection with the HD Vest Acquisition or in the future if goodwill or other intangible assets we acquired in the HD Vest Acquisition become impaired in the future;\n\u2022\nNotwithstanding the due diligence investigation we performed in connection with the HD Vest Acquisition, HD Vest may have liabilities, losses, or other exposures (including regulatory risks) for which we do not have adequate insurance coverage, indemnification, or other protection; and\n\u2022\nWe incurred substantial additional indebtedness to finance the HD Vest Acquisition, which will increase our vulnerability to increased debt service requirements should interest rates rise, reducing the amount of expected cash\nflow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and industries.\nOur financial and operating results may suffer if we are unsuccessful in integrating HD Vest, and any new businesses or technologies associated with HD Vest may not be complementary to our current operations or leverage our current infrastructure and operational experience.\nThe process of integrating HD Vest and technologies associated with it involves numerous risks that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or stock price, including:\n\u2022\nexpenses related to the acquisition process and impairment charges to goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s or other key personnel\u2019s attention from current operations and other business concerns and potential strain on financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing businesses, including impairment of existing relationships with employees, distributors, suppliers, or customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the operations, products, technology, information systems, and management and other personnel of HD Vest that result in unanticipated allocation of resources, costs, or delays;\n\u2022\nthe dilutive effect on earnings per share as a result of issuances of stock, incurring operating losses, and the amortization of intangible assets for HD Vest;\n\u2022\nstock volatility due to investors' uncertainty regarding the value of HD Vest;\n\u2022\nhigher debt service costs and a decline in stockholder equity in the event of poor financial performance;\n\u2022\ndiversion of capital from other uses;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in a timely manner, or at all; and\n\u2022\nadverse outcome of litigation matters or other contingent liabilities assumed in or arising out of the acquisition.\nDeveloping or acquiring a business or technology, and then integrating it with our other operations, is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. The successful integration of an acquisition requires, among other things, that we: retain key personnel; maintain and support preexisting supplier, distribution, and customer relationships; and integrate accounting and support functions. The complexity of the technologies and operations being integrated and the disparate corporate cultures and/or industries being combined may increase the difficulties of integrating an acquired technology or business.\nWe may face significant challenges in our plans to divest our InfoSpace and Monoprice businesses.\nAs part of our Strategic Transformation announcement, we outlined plans to divest our InfoSpace and Monoprice businesses, because they no longer align with our new strategic focus on the technology-enabled financial solutions industry. These planned divestitures pose risks and challenges that could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nThe uncertainty resulting from our announced plans to divest InfoSpace and Monoprice could cause significant disruptions in their businesses, including loss of key Search Customers, distribution partners, and suppliers or employees, that could harm the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our Search and Content and E-Commerce segments and make it difficult to complete the divestitures;\n\u2022\nEfforts to divest InfoSpace and Monoprice may divert our management\u2019s attention from our ongoing operations and the integration of HD Vest;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to identify suitable buyers of either business on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nThere are significant risks and uncertainties in the sales process, including the timing and uncertainty of completion of any transaction and the fulfillment of closing conditions, some of which may be outside of our control;\n\u2022\nAny significant delay in the completion of these divestitures, or the failure to complete the divestitures, may negatively impact our ability to implement our new strategic focus, delay repayment of indebtedness, negatively impact our ability to achieve our previously announced plans to reduce corporate operating expenses, and may impact our capital allocation priorities;\n\u2022\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by cash expenses and non-cash charges incurred in connection with the planned divestitures of InfoSpace and Monoprice, including retention and severance costs, transaction expenses, and asset impairment charges, which expenses and charges could be substantial whether or not we are able to divest these businesses; and\n\u2022\nEven if we succeed in divesting InfoSpace or Monoprice, the terms of any transaction may require us to retain certain liabilities or provide the purchaser with certain indemnification protection that could expose us to continued risks of these businesses.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESSES\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic, political, and other factors.\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and may in the future be, materially and adversely affected by market conditions and by economic and other factors. Such factors, which can be global, national or local in nature, include: political, social, economic and market conditions; the availability and cost of capital (whether debt or equity); the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; technological changes and events; U.S. and foreign government fiscal and tax policies; U.S. and foreign government ability, real or perceived, to avoid defaulting on government securities; inflation; investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; decline and stress or recession in the U.S. and global economies generally; terrorism and armed conflicts; and natural disasters such as weather catastrophes and widespread health emergencies. Furthermore, changes in consumer economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, decreases in property values, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality, which, in turn, could impact client activity in all of our businesses. These factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, including our divestiture of InfoSpace and Monoprice.\nIn particular, because the majority of our Tax Preparation business revenue and all of our Wealth Management business revenue is derived from sales within the U.S., economic conditions in the U.S. have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence. Challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing of our products and services, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenues and future financial results. Poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. In addition, weakness in the end-user consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. Any of these events could materially harm our business and our future financial results.\nIn addition, our Wealth Management business operates in the U.S. and global capital and credit markets and derives a substantial portion of its revenue from fees based on client assets. Therefore, fluctuations in the U.S. and global equity and debt markets can have a significant impact on HD Vest\u2019s revenues and earnings. As a result, these factors could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of our Wealth Management business. Poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. Clients do not have long-term obligations to us and can terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will. Our clients can also reduce the aggregate amount of their assets managed by us or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures, for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences, changes in our (or our financial advisors\u2019) reputation in the marketplace, changes in client management or ownership, loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance. A reduction in managed assets, and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and financial results.\nFuture revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products and services.\nThe tax preparation and wealth management industries are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and frequent new product introductions. Our competitors in such industries offer new and enhanced\nproducts and services every year. Consequently, client expectations are constantly changing. We must successfully innovate and develop or offer new products and features to meet evolving client needs and demands, while continually updating our technology infrastructure. We must devote significant resources to continue to develop our skills, tools, and capabilities in order to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies. Our inability to quickly and effectively innovate our products, services, and infrastructure could harm our business and financial results.\nOur Tax Preparation business also faces potential competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers. These or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future, which may cause us to lose customers and revenue. Although the Free File Alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to our tax offerings, we anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future. The current agreement with the Free File Alliance is scheduled to expire in October 2020.\nOur online tax preparation products and services have historically been provided through desktop computers, but the number of people who access similar offerings through mobile devices has increased dramatically in the past few years. We have limited experience to date in mobile platform development, and our existing user experience may not be compelling on mobile devices. Given the speed at which new devices and platforms are being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on newly developed devices, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of new user experiences. If we are slow to develop products and services that are compatible with these new devices, particularly if we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors, our market share will decline. In addition, such new products and services may not succeed in the marketplace, resulting in lost market share, wasted development costs, and damage to our brands.\nIf we are unable to develop, manage, and maintain critical third party business relationships for our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses, those businesses may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses are dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and leverage new and existing relationships. We rely on various third party partners, including software and service providers, suppliers, vendors, distributors, contractors, financial institutions, and licensing partners, among others, in many areas of these businesses to deliver our services and products. In certain instances, the products or services provided through these third party relationships may be difficult to replace or substitute, depending on the level of integration of the third party\u2019s products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party\u2019s products and services. In addition, there may be few or no alternative third party providers or vendors in the market. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services, and technologies or to update their products, services, and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations, which may materially reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and clients, and damage our reputation. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.\nOur Wealth Management business distributes certain investment and insurance products through distribution agreements with third-party financial institutions, including banks, mutual funds, and insurance companies. These products are sold by our financial advisors, who are independent contractors. Maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors and financial advisors is an important part of our growth strategy because strong third-party distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products and increase our assets under management, revenues, and profitability. There can be no assurance that the distribution and financial advisor relationships we have established will continue. Our distribution partners and financial advisors may cease to operate, consolidate, institute cost-cutting efforts, or otherwise terminate their relationship with us. Any such reduction in access to third-party distributors and financial advisors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our Wealth Management segment.\nAccess to investment and insurance product distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the broker-dealer, investment advisory and insurance industries. Relationships with distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of revenue we realize based on sales of particular products or client assets. In addition, regulatory changes may negatively impact our revenues and profits related to particular products or services. Any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or amount of products made available for sale, or revenue associated with those products, may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nThe Tax Preparation and Wealth Management markets are very competitive, and failure to effectively compete will materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur Tax Preparation business operates in a very competitive marketplace. There are many competing software products and online services. Intuit\u2019s TurboTax and H&R Block\u2019s products and services have a significant percentage of the software and online service market. Our Tax Preparation business must also compete with alternate methods of tax preparation, including \"pencil and paper\" do-it-yourself return preparation by individual filers and storefront tax preparation services, including both local tax preparers and large chains such as H&R Block, Liberty, and Jackson Hewitt. Finally, our Tax Preparation business faces the risk that state or federal taxing agencies will offer software or systems to provide direct access for individual filers that will reduce the need for TaxAct\u2019s software and services. Our financial results may materially suffer if we cannot continue to offer software and services that have quality and ease-of-use that are compelling to consumers; market the software and services in a cost-effective manner; offer ancillary services that are attractive to users; and develop the software and services at a low enough cost to be able to offer them at a competitive price point.\nThe wealth management industry in which HD Vest operates is highly competitive, and we may not be able to maintain our clients, financial advisors, distribution network, or the terms on which we provide our products and services. HD Vest competes based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, technology, product offerings and features, price, and perceived financial strength. Competitors in the wealth management industry include broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, insurers, and other financial institutions. Many of these competitors have greater market share, offer a broader range of products and have greater financial resources. In addition, over time certain sectors of the wealth management industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. This consolidation could result in our competitors gaining greater resources, and we may experience pressures on our pricing and market share as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices.\nOur operation systems and network infrastructure is subject to significant and constantly evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, and the security measures that we have implemented to secure confidential and personal information may be breached; a potential breach may pose risks to the uninterrupted operation of our systems, expose us to mitigation costs, litigation, investigation and penalties by authorities, claims by persons whose information was disclosed, and damage to our reputation.\nWe collect and retain certain sensitive personal data. Our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses collect, use, and retain large amounts of confidential personal and financial information from their customers and clients, including information regarding income, assets, family members, credit cards, tax returns, bank accounts, social security numbers, and healthcare. Maintaining the integrity of these systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations, including the retention of our customers, clients and advisors, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our customers' and clients\u2019 personal information. A major breach of our systems or those of our third-party service providers may have materially negative consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns. We may detect, or we may receive notices from customers or clients or public or private agencies that they have detected, vulnerabilities in our servers, our software, or third-party software components that are distributed with our products. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a security breach, may harm customer and client confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and industry rules relating to the collection, use, and security of user data. We expect regulation in this area to increase. As a result of our current data protection policies and practices may not be sufficient and thus may require modification. New regulations may require notification to customers, clients, or employees of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information, and hinder our ability to acquire new, or market to, existing customers and clients. As our business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy and data security, our compliance requirements and costs may increase. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations.\nIn addition, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that can be used to attack our offerings. Although we utilize network and application security measures, internal controls, and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal information will not occur. Any such incident may materially harm our business, reputation, and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under data privacy regulations. In addition, our employees (including temporary and seasonal employees) and contractors may have access to sensitive and\npersonal information of our customers, clients, and employees. While we conduct background checks of our employees and these other individuals and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these individuals may circumvent these controls, resulting in a security breach. In addition, we rely on third party vendors to host certain of our sensitive and personal information and data. While we conduct due diligence on these third party partners with respect to their security and business controls, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures, and, in any event, individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these security and business controls, resulting in a loss of sensitive and personal customer, client, or employee information and data.\nDespite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity and technology risks, we cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers\u2019 and clients\u2019 personal information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers, clients, or advisors, or other damage to our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, this insurance is subject to exclusions and may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks as well as the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of appropriate security measures. We could also suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins, inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our businesses.\nOur website and transaction management software, data center systems, or the systems of third-party co-location facilities and cloud service providers could fail or become unavailable or otherwise be inadequate, which could materially harm our reputation and result in a material loss of revenues and current or potential customers and clients.\nAny system interruptions that result in the unavailability or unreliability of our websites, transaction processing systems, or network infrastructure could materially reduce our revenue and impair our ability to properly process transactions. We use both internally developed and third-party systems, including cloud computing and storage systems, for our online services and certain aspects of transaction processing. Some of our systems are relatively new and untested and thus may be subject to failure or unreliability. Any system unavailability or unreliability may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, degradation in customer satisfaction, additional expense, or delays in reporting accurate financial information.\nOur data centers and cloud service could be susceptible to damage or disruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and financial results. Our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management businesses have disaster recovery centers but if their primary data centers fail and those disaster recovery centers do not fully restore the failed environments, our business will suffer. In particular, if such interruption occurs during the tax season, the revenue of our Tax Preparation business would be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur systems and operations, and those of our third-party service providers, could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, earthquakes, other natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, internet breakdown, break-in, human error, software bugs, hardware failures, malicious attacks, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, or other events beyond our control. Such damage or interruption may affect internal and external systems that we rely upon to provide our services, take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests, and host other products and services. During the period in which services are unavailable, we will be unable or severely limited in our ability to generate revenues, and we may also be exposed to liability from those third parties to whom we provide services. We could face significant losses as a result of these events, and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all potential losses.\nA drop in our investment performance could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nInvestment performance is a key competitive factor for our Wealth Management segment. Strong investment performance helps to increase client retention and generate sales of products and services. There can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to our competitors, and historical performance is not indicative of future returns. Any drop or perceived drop in investment performance, on an absolute or relative basis, could cause a decline in sales of mutual funds and other investment products, an increase in redemptions and the termination of asset management relationships. These\nimpacts may reduce our aggregate amount of assets under management and reduce management fees. Poor investment performance could also adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through independent financial advisors.\nRestrictions on or litigation regarding financial products may materially harm our financial results.\nIn our Tax Preparation business, we generate revenue from certain financial products related to our tax preparation software and services. These products include prepaid debit cards on which a tax filer may receive his or her tax refund and the ability of certain of our users to have the fees for our services deducted from their tax refund. Any regulation of these products by state or federal governments, or any competing products offered by state and federal tax collection agencies, could materially and adversely impact our revenue from these financial products. In addition, litigation brought by consumers or state or federal agencies relating to these products may result in additional restrictions on the offering of these products. To the extent that any such additional restrictions or legal claims restrict our ability to offer such products, our financial results may materially suffer.\nOur Wealth Management business offers products sponsored by third parties, including but not limited mutual funds, insurance, annuities and alternative investments. These products are subject to complex regulations that change frequently. Although HD Vest has controls in place to facilitate compliance with such regulations, there can be no assurance that its interpretation of the regulations will be consistent with various regulators\u2019 interpretations, that its procedures will be viewed as adequate by regulatory examiners, or that the operating subsidiaries will be deemed to be in compliance with regulatory requirements in all material respects. If products sold by the firm were not to perform as anticipated due to market factors or otherwise, or if the product sponsor became insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations, this would likely result in material litigation and regulatory action against HD Vest relating to its sales of those products.\nRegistered investment advisors have fiduciary obligations that require us and our advisors to act in the best interests of our clients and to disclose any material conflicts of interest. We may face liabilities for actual or alleged breaches of legal duties to clients with respect to the suitability of the financial products we make available in our open architecture product platform or the investment advice of our financial advisors.\nUnanticipated changes in income tax rates, deduction types, or taxation structure may materially and adversely affect our Tax Preparation business.\nChanges in the way that state and federal governments structure their taxation regimes may materially and adversely affect our financial results. The introduction of a simplified or flattened taxation structure may make our services less necessary or attractive to individual filers. We also face risk from the possibility of increased complexity in taxation structures, which may encourage some of our customers to seek professional tax advice instead of using our software or services. In the event that such changes to tax structures cause us to lose market share, our results may materially suffer.\nIf our Tax Preparation business fails to process transactions effectively or fails to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be materially harmed.\nOur Tax Preparation business processes a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, particularly during tax season. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that fraudulent activity may affect our services. In addition to any direct damages and fines that may result from any such problems, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence in our controls may materially harm our business and damage our brand. The systems supporting our Tax Preparation business are comprised of multiple technology platforms, some of which are difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable, and timely manner, which may materially harm our business.\nThe seasonality of our Tax Preparation business requires a precise development and release schedule and any delays or issues with accuracy or quality may damage our reputation and materially harm our future financial results.\nOur tax preparation software and online service must be ready to launch in final form near the beginning of each calendar year to take advantage of the full tax season. We must update the code for our software and service on a precise schedule each year to account for annual changes in tax laws and regulations and ensure that the software and service are accurate. Delayed and unpredictable changes to federal and state tax laws and regulations can cause an already tight development cycle to become even more challenging. If we are unable to meet this precise schedule and we launch our software and service late, we risk losing customers to our competitors. If we cannot develop our software with a high degree of accuracy and quality, we risk errors in the tax returns that are generated. Such errors could result in loss of reputation, lower customer retention, or legal claims, fees, and payouts related to the warranty on our software and service.\nRisk management policies and procedures for our Tax Preparation and Wealth Management business may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including employee and financial advisor misconduct.\nWe are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by our employees and financial advisors, such as fraud, non-compliance with policies, recommending transactions that are not suitable, and improperly using or disclosing confidential information. Although we have internal controls in place, these issues are difficult to detect in advance and deter, and could materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are further subject to the risk of nonperformance or inadequate performance of contractual obligations by third-party vendors of products and services that are used in our businesses. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as the risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency.\nIncreased government regulation of our business may harm our operating results.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations that affect our activities, including, without limitation, areas of labor, advertising, tax, financial services, data privacy and security requirements, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property ownership and infringement, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas, as well as in areas such as insurance and healthcare (including, for example, the Affordable Care Act). As we complete our Strategic Transformation and expand our products and services and revise our business models, we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny. Regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours as well as the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, require notification to customers, clients, or employees of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information, or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior that may make our business more costly, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products or services, which may materially harm our future financial results.\nThe tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by the government or private entities, or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our Tax Preparation business or offer our tax preparation products and services. We may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities. In addition, if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws, we may become subject to lawsuits, penalties, and other liabilities that did not previously apply. We are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner and at an acceptable price.\nOur Wealth Management business is subject to certain additional financial industry regulations and supervision, including by the SEC, FINRA, state securities and insurance regulators, and other regulatory authorities. Our failure to comply with the\nlaws, rules, and regulations promulgated by federal regulatory bodies and the regulatory authorities in each of the states and other jurisdictions in which we do business could result in the restriction of the ongoing conduct or growth, or even liquidation of, parts of our business and otherwise materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. These regulatory authorities continuously review legislative and regulatory initiatives and may adopt new or revised laws, regulations, or interpretations, and there can also be no assurance that other federal or state agencies will not attempt to further regulate our business. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted into law in 2010, called for sweeping changes in the supervision and regulations of the wealth management industry. Regulators implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have adopted, proposed to adopt, and will in the future adopt regulations that we expect will materially impact the manner in which we will market HD Vest products and services, manage HD Vest operations, and interact with regulators.\nIn addition, the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) has proposed regulations seeking to change the definition of who is a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d), and how such advice must be provided to account holders in ERISA plans and individual retirement accounts (\u201cIRAs\u201d). These regulations are expected to focus on conflicts of interest related to recommendations made by financial advisors to clients holding qualified accounts and also on how financial advisors are able to solicit rollovers. IRAs make up a majority of HD Vest's assets under management and administration. We cannot predict whether or when the regulations may be finalized, or how any final regulations may differ from the previously proposed regulations. DOL recently sent the regulations to the Office of Management and Budget for review, which could mean final regulations are imminent. The final regulations may negatively impact how we receive fees, how we compensate our advisors, how we are able to retain advisors, and how we design our investment products and services for accounts covered by the rule, any of which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit, and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, audit, and risk management personnel. While we have adopted systems, policies, and procedures reasonably designed to comply or facilitate compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations, these systems, policies, and procedures may not be fully effective. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to investigations, claims, or other actions or proceedings by regulators or third-parties with respect to our past or future compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nHD Vest distributes its products and services through financial advisors who affiliate with the firm as independent contractors. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change, or at least challenge, the classification of our financial advisors as independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified our advisors as independent contractors, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other U.S. federal or state authorities or similar authorities may determine that we have misclassified our advisors as independent contractors for employment tax or other purposes and, as a result, seek additional taxes from us or attempt to impose fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business model, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands, which could be negatively impacted by poor performance.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers and clients. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to regulatory proceedings or other events or activities attributed to our businesses, our employees, our vendors, or our partners may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. In addition, if we are unable to successfully integrate HD Vest or if we are unable to develop awareness of the HD Vest brand, our reputation could be damaged. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our future financial results. Such damage also would require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands.\nIf others claim that our services infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to seek expensive licenses, reengineer our services, engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation, or stop marketing and licensing our services.\nCompanies and individuals with rights relating to the technology industry have frequently resorted to litigation regarding intellectual property rights. These parties have in the past made and may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy or publicity rights. Responding to any such claims could be time-consuming, result\nin costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention, cause product or service release delays, or require removal or redesigning of our products or services, payment of damages for infringement, or entry into royalty or licensing agreements. Our technology, services, and products may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. In some cases, the ownership or scope of an entity\u2019s or person\u2019s rights is unclear. In addition, the ownership or scope of such rights may be altered by changes in the legal landscape, such as through developments in U.S. or international intellectual property laws or regulations or through court, agency, or regulatory board decisions. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or content, or license the infringed or similar technology or content, on a timely and cost-effective basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not regularly conduct patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products or services infringes patents held by third parties. Patent searches may not return every issued patent or patent application that may be deemed relevant to a particular product or service. It is therefore difficult to determine, with any level of certainty, whether a particular product or service may be construed as infringing a current or future U.S. or foreign patent.\nWe rely heavily on our technology and intellectual property, but we may be unable to adequately or cost-effectively protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our business and financial results. We may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, which can be time consuming, expensive, and difficult to predict.\nTo protect our rights in our services and technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. We also rely on laws pertaining to trademarks and domain names to protect the value of our corporate brands and reputation. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services or technology, obtain and use information, marks, or technology that we regard as proprietary, or otherwise violate or infringe our intellectual property rights. In addition, it is possible that others could independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, or if others independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property, our competitive position could be materially weakened.\nEffectively policing the unauthorized use of our services and technology is time-consuming and costly, and the steps taken by us may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or other proprietary assets. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective, and unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services, use similar marks or domain names, or obtain and use information, marks, or technology that we regard as proprietary. In some cases, the ownership or scope of an entity\u2019s or person\u2019s rights is unclear and may also change over time, including through changes in U.S. or international intellectual property laws or regulations or through court, agency, or regulatory board decisions.\nWe may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of others\u2019 proprietary rights, which are sometimes not clear or may change. Litigation can be time-consuming and expensive, and the outcome can be difficult to predict.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees, including our key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our businesses.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, retain, and motivate highly skilled management, technical, sales and marketing, and corporate development personnel, including personnel with experience and expertise in the wealth management, tax preparation, and technology industries to support our new strategic focus. Qualified personnel with experience relevant to our businesses are scarce, and competition to recruit them is intense. If we fail to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of highly qualified employees, we may have difficulties in supporting or expanding our businesses. Realignments of resources, reductions in workforce, or other operational decisions have created and could continue to create an unstable work environment and may have a negative effect on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate employees.\nAs part of our announcement on October 14, 2015 with respect to the Strategic Transformation, we announced a leadership succession plan under which William J. Ruckelshaus will resign his position as President and Chief Executive Officer when a permanent successor has been identified. Following such announcement, our Board of Directors commenced and is currently engaged in a search process to identify, evaluate and select a new President and Chief Executive Officer to lead Blucora through the Strategic Transformation. Our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key employees. Changes of management or key employees may disrupt operations, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results or delay achievement of our business objectives. In addition, if we lose the services of one or more key employees and are unable to recruit and retain a suitable successor, we may not be able to successfully and\ntimely manage our business or achieve our business objectives. There can be no assurance that any retention program we initiate will be successful at retaining employees, including key employees.\nWe use stock options, restricted stock units, and other equity-based awards to recruit and retain senior level employees. With respect to those employees to whom we issue such equity-based awards, we face a significant challenge in retaining them if the value of equity-based awards in aggregate or individually is either not deemed by the employee to be substantial enough or deemed so substantial that the employee leaves after their equity-based awards vest. If our stock price does not increase significantly above the exercise prices of our options, we may need to issue new equity-based awards in order to motivate and retain our key employees. We may undertake or seek stockholder approval to undertake other equity-based programs to retain our employees, which may be viewed as dilutive to our stockholders or may increase our compensation costs. There can be no assurance that any such programs, if approved by stockholders, or any other incentive programs, would be successful in motivating and retaining our employees.\nRestructuring and streamlining our business, including implementing reductions in workforce, discretionary spending, and other expense reductions, may materially harm our businesses.\nWe have in the past found and may in the future find it advisable to take measures to streamline operations and reduce expenses, including, without limitation, reducing our workforce or discontinuing products or businesses. For example, in connection with our Strategic Transformation (as described in the \"Strategic Transformation\" section in Part II Item 7 of this annual report), we have effected and will in the future effect significant reductions-in-force. Such measures may place significant strains on our management and employees. We may also incur liabilities from these measures, including liabilities from early termination or assignment of contracts, potential failure to meet obligations due to loss of employees or resources, and resulting litigation. Such effects from restructuring and streamlining could have a materially negative impact on our business, financial condition, and financial results.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or assets that complement our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses, and our financial and operating results may materially suffer if we are unsuccessful in completing any such acquisitions on favorable terms.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or assets that complement our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses. There can be no guarantee that any of the opportunities that we evaluate will result in the purchase by us of any business or asset being evaluated, or that, if acquired, we will be able to successfully integrate such acquisition.\nIf we are successful in our pursuit of any complementary acquisition opportunities, we intend to use available cash, debt and/or equity financing, and/or other capital or ownership structures designed to diversify our capital sources and attract a competitive cost of capital, all of which may change our leverage profile. There are a number of factors that impact our ability to succeed in acquiring the companies and assets we identify, including competition for these companies and assets, sometimes from larger or better-funded competitors. As a result, our success in completing acquisitions is not guaranteed. Our expectation is that, to the extent we are successful, any acquisitions will be additive to our businesses, taking into account potential benefits of operational synergies. However, these new business additions and acquisitions, if any, involve a number of risks and may not achieve our expectations, and, therefore, we could be materially and adversely affected by any such new business additions or acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the short or long-term value of any business or technology that we develop or acquire will be equal to the value of the cash and other consideration that we pay or expenses we incur.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nWe incurred debt in connection with our acquisitions of Monoprice and HD Vest and may incur future debt related to other complementary acquisitions, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Monoprice, that company incurred debt under a November 2013 credit facility, of which $25.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2015. In connection with our acquisition of HD Vest, TaxAct and HD Vest incurred debt under a December 2015 credit facility, of which $400.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The Monoprice and TaxAct-HD Vest credit facilities are non-recourse debts. The Monoprice credit facility is guaranteed by Monoprice Holdings, Inc., and the TaxAct-HD Vest credit facility is guaranteed by TaxAct Holdings, Inc. and HD Vest Holdings, Inc., all of which are Blucora\u2019s direct subsidiaries. These debts may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing Monoprice\u2019s, TaxAct\u2019s, or HD Vest's vulnerability to downturns in their businesses, to competitive pressures, and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from Monoprice\u2019s, TaxAct\u2019s, and HD Vest's operations to service the indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and complementary acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrequiring cash infusions from Blucora to Monoprice, TaxAct, or HD Vest if any or all are unable to meet their payment or other obligations under the applicable credit facilities;\n\u2022\nincreasing our interest payment obligations in the event that interest rates rise dramatically; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.\nThese credit facilities impose restrictions on Monoprice, TaxAct, and HD Vest, including restrictions on their ability to create liens on their assets and on our ability to incur indebtedness, and require Monoprice, TaxAct, and HD Vest to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Their ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond their control. In addition, these credit facilities include covenants, the breach of which may cause the outstanding indebtedness to be declared immediately due and payable. These debts, and our ability to repay them, may also negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing.\nIn addition, we or our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future to finance complementary acquisitions or for other purposes. Any additional debt may result in risks similar to those discussed above related to the Monoprice and TaxAct-HD Vest debts or in other risks specific to the credit agreements entered into for those debts.\nWe sold $201.25 million of Convertible Senior Notes in 2013, which may impact our financial results, result in the dilution of existing stockholders, and restrict our ability to take advantage of future opportunities.\nIn March 2013, we sold $201.25 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) due 2019. The accounting for the Notes results in the recognition of interest expense significantly more than the stated interest rate of the Notes and may result in volatility to our financial results. The Notes may be settled in a combination of cash or shares of common stock, indicating that the Notes contain liability and equity components. Upon issuance of the Notes, we were required to establish a separate initial value for the conversion option, the equity component, and bifurcate this value from the value attributable to the debt component of the Notes. As a result, for accounting purposes, we were required to treat the Notes as having been issued with a debt discount to their principal amount. We are accreting the debt discount to interest expense ratably over the term of the Notes, which amounts to an effective interest rate in our financial results that exceeds the stated interest rate of the Notes. This will reduce our earnings and could adversely affect the price at which our common stock trades but will have no effect on the amount of cash interest paid to holders or on our cash flows.\nOur intent is to settle conversions of the Notes with cash for the principal amount of the debt and shares of common stock for any related conversion premium. Shares associated with the conversion premium will be included in diluted earnings per share when the average stock price exceeds the conversion price of the Notes and could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share and the price at which our common stock trades.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, and the requirement to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, may adversely affect our financial condition and financial results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled, at their option, to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods. If we undergo a fundamental change (as described in the applicable Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or part of their Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe payment of the interest and the repayment of principal at maturity, conversion, or under a fundamental change will require the use of a substantial amount of our cash. If such cash is not available, we may be required to sell other assets or enter into alternate financing arrangements at terms that may or may not be desirable. The existence of the Notes and the obligations we incurred by issuing them may hinder our ability to take advantage of certain future opportunities, such as engaging in future debt or equity financing activities, which may in turn reduce or impair our ability to acquire new businesses or invest in our existing businesses.\nExisting cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for servicing debt, working capital, and capital expenditures.\nAlthough we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for servicing debt, working capital, and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months, the underlying levels of revenues and expenses that we project may not prove to be accurate. In March 2013, we sold $201.25 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Monoprice had $25.0 million outstanding under the credit facility entered into in November 2013, and HD Vest and TaxAct had $400.0 million outstanding under the credit facility entered into in December 2015. Servicing these debts will require the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our businesses may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition and results at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nIn addition, we may evaluate complementary acquisitions of businesses, products, or technologies from time to time. Any such transactions, if completed, may use a significant portion of our cash balances and marketable investments. If we are unable to liquidate our investments when we need liquidity for complementary acquisitions or for other business purposes, we may need to change or postpone such acquisitions or find alternative financing for them. We may seek additional funding through public or private financings, through sales of equity, or through other arrangements. Our ability to raise funds may be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including factors beyond our control, such as economic conditions in the markets in which we operate and increased uncertainty in the financial, capital, and credit markets. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to existing stockholders may result. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may be unable, or delayed in our ability, to develop or enhance our products or services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could materially harm our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nThe current challenges in the Search and Content business may continue.\nOur Search and Content business has faced significant challenges, beginning in early 2014 and continuing to the present. These challenges have resulted in significant declines in the financial results for this business, and if current trends cannot be reversed, the ability of this business to operate profitably will be significantly challenged in future periods. The continuing challenges include, among other things, limitations in InfoSpace's ability to monetize its mobile advertising offering as a result of changes in our agreement with Google, losses of distribution partners, and suspended or limited access to its services for certain distribution partners and our own sites due to regular monitoring of policy and compliance requirements. Although InfoSpace has addressed, to varying degrees, some of these challenges, it has been unable to address all of them, and additional issues have emerged, leading to continued and significant pressure on our Search and Content business. These challenges may be exacerbated by our announcement that we intend to divest the Search and Content business. If InfoSpace is unable to successfully address its current challenges, or if new issues emerge, it is likely to see a continued material adverse effect on its Search and Content business, and our efforts to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all, may be impaired.\nInfoSpace may be unable to compete successfully in the search market.\nInfoSpace faces intense competition in the search market. Many of its competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, more developed infrastructures, greater brand recognition, better access to vendors, or more established relationships in the industry than it has. Some of the companies that it competes with in the search market are currently Search Customers of InfoSpace, the loss of any of which could harm its business. In addition, it may face increasing competition for search market share from new search startups, mobile search providers, and social media sites and applications. If InfoSpace is unable to match or exceed its competitors\u2019 marketing reach and customer service experience, its business may not be successful and our ability to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all, may be impaired.\nIn addition, InfoSpace's search business, and that of most of its distribution partners, is primarily based on searches conducted from browsers and other applications on desktop and laptop computers. As mobile phones, tablets, and other mobile devices increase in popularity, functionality, and usage, mobile searches will constitute an increasing percentage of the search market. Because InfoSpace's search business has been primarily focused on the desktop and laptop markets, it may have less experience and capability in offering and monetizing mobile search services than its competitors. In addition, because it relies on its Search Customers to provide it with search results and advertisements, its ability to innovate for mobile search and to expand in that market is dependent on the cooperation of, and collaboration with, those Search Customers. Under the terms of its current agreement with Google, which took effect on April 1, 2014 and was subsequently amended, InfoSpace's revenue share rate with respect to Google's mobile search advertisements is significantly lower than the revenue share rate for desktop advertisements. As a result, InfoSpace has increased its usage of its other current advertising solutions for mobile and/or found additional mobile advertising solutions and partners. Nonetheless, if InfoSpace cannot develop services and partners that allow it to sufficiently innovate for the mobile search market and if its mobile advertising solutions monetize at a significantly lower level than its desktop advertising solutions, its ability to participate in the market shift to mobile search will be impaired, which will likely have a material adverse effect on its search business, its financial results, and our ability to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all.\nMost of InfoSpace's search services revenue is attributable to Google, and the loss or termination of its relationship, or a payment dispute with, Google or any other significant Search Customer would materially harm its business and financial results.\nIf any existing or future significant Search Customer, such as Google, Yahoo!, or Bing, were to substantially reduce InfoSpace's revenue share rates or substantially reduce, eliminate, or increase the cost of the content it provides to InfoSpace or to its distribution partners, or if InfoSpace was to terminate or substantially reduce the extent of its relationship with any existing or future significant Search Customer, its business results could materially suffer and our ability to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all, may be impaired.\nFailure by InfoSpace or its search distribution partners to comply with the policies promulgated by Google, Yahoo!, and Bing may cause that Search Customer to temporarily or permanently suspend the use of its content or terminate its agreement with InfoSpace, or may require it to modify or terminate certain distribution relationships.\nIf InfoSpace or its search distribution partners fail to meet the policies promulgated by Google, Yahoo!, or Bing for the use of their content, it may not be able to continue to use their content or provide the content to such distribution partners. InfoSpace's agreements with Google, Yahoo!, and Bing give them the ability to suspend the use and the distribution of their content for non-compliance with their requirements and policies and, in the case of breaches of certain other provisions of their agreements, to terminate their agreements with InfoSpace immediately, regardless of whether such breaches could be cured. If InfoSpace's Search Customers were to suspend or terminate their agreements with us, it would not receive any revenue from any property of its or its distribution partner that is affected by the suspended content, and the loss of such revenue could materially harm its business, financial condition and financial results.\nInfoSpace may be subject to liability for its use or distribution of information that it gathers or receives from third parties and indemnity protections or insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability.\nInfoSpace's search services obtain content and commerce information from third parties and link users, either directly through its own websites or indirectly through the web properties of its distribution partners, to third-party webpages and content in response to search queries and other requests. These services could expose InfoSpace to legal liability from claims relating to such third-party content and sites, the manner in which these services are distributed and displayed by InfoSpace or its distribution partners, or how the content provided by its Search Customers was obtained or provided by its Search Customers. This could subject InfoSpace to legal liability for such things as defamation, negligence, intellectual property infringement, violation of privacy or publicity rights, and product or service liability, among others. The laws or regulations of certain jurisdictions may also deem some content illegal, which also may expose it to liability. Regardless of the legal merits of any such claims, they could result in costly litigation, be time-consuming to defend, and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. If there were a determination that InfoSpace had violated third-party rights or applicable law, it could incur substantial monetary liability, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements (if available), or be required to change its business practices. InfoSpace is also subject to laws and regulations, both in the United States and abroad, regarding the collection and use of end user information and search-related data. If it does not comply with these laws and regulations, it may be exposed to legal liability, which could negatively impact its financial results and our ability to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all, may be impaired.\nOur efforts to transition our Search and Content business may not be successful.\nAs a result of the challenges discussed above, we have invested in initiatives to transition our Search and Content business to methods of monetization that can be more viable long term. These initiatives are targeted at business opportunities that we believe are promising, but the initiatives are still in their early stages, and there can be no assurance that we will identify viable alternate monetization methods, that we will successfully execute the changes necessary for this transition, that this transition will occur on a time line sufficient to offset declines in the business, that we will identify and attract partners needed for this transition, or that our Search Customers will permit the changes necessary for this transition. Our transition efforts may be set back by our announcement that we intend to divest our Search and Content business. If the current challenges continue and this transition is not successful, our Search and Content business will likely experience continued declines in its financial results, the ability of this business to operate profitably will be significantly challenged in future periods, and our ability to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all, may be impaired.\nThe electronics and accessories market is highly competitive, and failure to effectively compete will adversely affect our financial results.\nThe electronics and accessories market in which our Monoprice business sells products is highly competitive. All of Monoprice\u2019s products face competition from many sellers of similar products, of which some sellers are much larger and more well-known than Monoprice. Monoprice attempts to offer products that provide similar quality and technology as those offered by its competitors, but at a lower price, and it attempts to do so with customer service and support that equals or exceeds that of many of its competitors. Many of its competitors have significant competitive advantages over it that may materially and adversely affect its ability to successfully compete on price, quality, technology, service, or support, including larger scale, advanced research facilities, extensive experience in the industry, proprietary intellectual property, greater financial resources, more advanced and extensive supply chain and distribution capacity, better service and support capability, and stronger relationships with suppliers and resellers. If Monoprice is unable to successfully compete on price, quality, technology, service, or support, it may not be able to attract and retain customers which would materially impact our financial results and our ability to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all.\nIf Monoprice fails to accurately forecast customer demand, its inventory may either exceed demand or be insufficient to meet demand, which could materially harm our financial results.\nMonoprice relies on its supplier network to manufacture its products, and as a result, it must forecast demand for its products well in advance of the sale of those products when placing orders from our suppliers. If its orders exceed eventual demand, it will have excess inventory, which will increase its inventory carrying costs, may increase risk that those products will become obsolete prior to sale, and may result in write-offs and/or significant price reductions of that inventory. If orders are insufficient to meet demand, Monoprice may not be able to adequately replace that inventory to meet all customer orders in a timely manner, resulting in back-orders, potential lost sales, and negative customer experiences. Significant failure to accurately forecast customer demand may thus materially impact our short-term financial results and our ability to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all.\nMonoprice depends on international third-party manufacturers to supply its electronics and accessories, and risks related to the manufacture and shipping of its products could materially and adversely affect its operations and financial results.\nMonoprice outsources most of the manufacturing of its electronics and accessories to suppliers in Asia. It relies on the performance of these suppliers, and any problems with such performance could result in cost overruns, delayed deliveries, shortages, poor quality control, intellectual property issues (both theft of its intellectual property and infringement by its suppliers of the intellectual property of others), and compliance issues. Performance problems by its suppliers could result from many events, including the following: suppliers\u2019 willful or unintentional breach of supply agreements; their failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; labor unrest at their facilities; civil unrest; natural or human disasters at production or shipping facilities; equipment or other facility failures; their inability to acquire sufficient quantities or qualities of components or raw materials at expected prices; infrastructure problems in their countries (e.g., power or transportation infrastructure problems); their bankruptcy, insolvency, or other financial problems; and requests or requirements by their other customers that may conflict with its requirements. In addition, because most of Monoprice's products are shipped from Asia, the company faces risks related to such shipping, including performance failures by its shipping partners and those of its suppliers, natural disasters, shipping equipment failure, and export and import regulation compliance issues. In late 2014 and early 2015, Monoprice's ability to maintain adequate inventory was impacted by slowdowns in offloading container ships resulting from\nlabor disputes. These slowdowns could recur, with the result that the impact on Monoprice's ability to maintain inventory could be impaired.\nThe performance of Monoprice's manufacturers, suppliers, and shippers is largely outside of its control. As the result of any performance failures, Monoprice may lose sales, or it may be required to adjust product designs, change production schedules, or develop suitable alternative contract manufacturers, suppliers, or shippers, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to its customers and/or increased costs. Any such delays, disruptions, or quality problems could adversely impact its ability to sell its products, harm its reputation, impair its customer relationships, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMonoprice's electronics and accessories could experience quality or safety defects that could result in damage to our reputation, require it to provide replacement products, or cause it to institute product recalls.\nWe expect that all of Monoprice's electronics and accessories will meet or exceed all applicable standards for quality and safety. Monoprice monitors and attempts to address any quality or safety issues during the design and manufacturing processes, but some problems or defects may not be identified until after introduction and shipment of products to consumers. Resolving such problems or defects may result in increased costs related to production and shipment of replacement parts or products, increased customer support requirements, and redesign and manufacture of products. If Monoprice is unable to fix defects in a timely manner or adequately address quality control issues, its relationships with its customers may be impaired, its reputation may suffer, and it may lose customers. If the problems or defects result in a significant safety hazard, Monoprice may be forced to institute a product recall, resulting in negative publicity, loss of reputation, administrative costs, distraction of personnel from regular duties, and recall, refund, and replacement expenses. In addition, such product recalls may result in disputes with suppliers and customers or lead to adverse proceedings such as arbitration or litigation, which can be costly and expensive and could have a negative impact on our ability to divest the business at a price we deem adequate, or at all.\nProduct liability claims or regulatory actions could materially and adversely affect Monoprice's financial results or harm its reputation.\nAs the seller of consumer products, Monoprice faces the possibility that there will be claims for losses or injuries caused by some of its products. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm its reputation in the marketplace. Monoprice also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of possible defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although Monoprice maintains product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of coverage or could be excluded under the terms of the policy.\nOTHER RISKS\nOur stock price has been highly volatile and such volatility may continue.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile. Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015, our closing stock price ranged from $9.55 to $28.73. On February 16, 2016, the closing price of our common stock was $6.61. Our stock price could decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including the other risks discussed in this report and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual results of operations;\n\u2022\nimpairment charges, changes in or loss of material contracts and relationships, dispositions or announcements of complementary acquisitions, or other business developments by us, our partners, or our competitors;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the tax preparation, wealth management, search and content services, or e-commerce markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ndisclosures of any accounting issues, such as restatements or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nequity issuances resulting in the dilution of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new regulations or accounting standards;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity (whether justified or not) with respect to our business; and\n\u2022\nannouncements or publicity relating to litigation or governmental enforcement actions.\nIn addition, the equities market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and our stock has been particularly susceptible to such fluctuations. Often, class action litigation has been instituted against companies after periods of volatility in the price of such companies\u2019 stock. We have been defendants in such class action litigation in prior periods and could be subject to future litigation, potentially resulting in substantial cost and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur financial results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to be volatile or decline.\nOur financial results have varied on a quarterly basis and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to be volatile or decline. Many factors could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate materially, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe inability of any of our businesses to meet our expectations;\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of our Tax Preparation business and the resulting large quarterly fluctuations in our revenues;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our Strategic Transformation and our ability to implement those initiatives in a cost effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe mix of revenues generated by existing businesses, discontinued operations or other businesses that we develop or acquire;\n\u2022\ngains or losses driven by fair value accounting;\n\u2022\nlitigation expenses and settlement costs;\n\u2022\nmisconduct by employees and HD Vest financial advisors, which is difficult to detect and deter;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in finding, evaluating, negotiating, consummating, and integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\nimpairment or negative performance of the many different industries and counterparties we rely on and are exposed to;\n\u2022\nvariable demand for our services, rapidly evolving technologies and markets, and consumer preferences;\n\u2022\nany restructuring charges we may incur;\n\u2022\nany economic downturn, which could result in lower acceptance rates on premium products and services offered by our Wealth Management business and impact the commissions and fee revenues of our financial advisory services;\n\u2022\nthe level and mix of assets we have under management and administration, which are subject to fluctuation based on market conditions and client activity;\n\u2022\nnew court rulings, or the adoption of new laws, rules, or regulations, that adversely affect our tax preparation products and services, or our wealth management offerings or that otherwise increase our potential liability or compliance costs;\n\u2022\nimpairment in the value of long-lived assets or the value of acquired assets, including goodwill, technology, and acquired contracts and relationships; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of changes in accounting principles or standards or in our accounting treatment of revenues or expenses.\nFor these reasons, among others, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance. Furthermore, our fluctuating operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors and financial results volatility could make us less attractive to investors, either of which could cause the trading price of our stock to decline.\nIf there is a change in our ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be severely limited or potentially eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had federal NOLs of $521.1 million that will expire primarily between 2020 and 2024. If we were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (defined as a cumulative change of 50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders owning five percent or more of a company\u2019s common stock over a three-year rolling period), then under certain conditions, the amount of NOLs we could use in any one year could be limited. Our certificate of incorporation imposes certain limited transfer restrictions on our common stock that we expect will assist us in preventing a change of ownership and preserving our NOLs, but there can be no assurance that these restrictions will be sufficient. In addition, other restrictions on our ability to use the NOLs may be triggered by a merger or acquisition, depending on the structure of such a transaction. It is our intention to limit the potential impact of these restrictions, but there can be no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. If we are unable to use our NOLs before they expire, or if the use of this tax benefit is severely limited or eliminated, there could be a material reduction in the amount of after-tax income and cash flow from operations, and it could have an effect on our ability to engage in certain transactions.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. For example, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a third party from acquiring us without the consent of our board of directors, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our charter documents that could have an anti-takeover effect include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors into three groups so that directors serve staggered three-year terms, which may make it difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for super majority approval by stockholders for certain business combinations;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of undesignated preferred stock without a vote by stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on stockholders\u2019 ability to call special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\ncertain restrictions in our charter on transfers of our common stock designed to preserve our federal NOLs.\nAt our 2009 annual meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that restricts any person or entity from attempting to transfer our stock, without prior permission from the Board of Directors, to the extent that such transfer would (i) create or result in an individual or entity becoming a five-percent stockholder of our stock, or (ii) increase the stock ownership percentage of any existing five-percent stockholder. This amendment provides that any transfer that violates its provisions shall be null and void and would require the purported transferee to, upon our demand, transfer the shares that exceed the five percent limit to an agent designated by us for the purpose of conducting a sale of such excess shares. This provision in our certificate of incorporation may make the acquisition of Blucora more expensive to the acquirer and could significantly delay, discourage, or prevent third parties from acquiring Blucora without the approval of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 86544, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "BCOR"}
