{"cik": "1082324", "company": "VirnetX Holding Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock. You should carefully consider the following information and the other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.\nWe may not be able to capitalize on market opportunities related to our licensing strategy or our patent portfolio.\nOur business strategy includes licensing our patents and technology to other companies in order to reach a larger end-user base than we could reach through direct sales and marketing efforts. As such, our business strategy and revenues will depend on intellectual property licensing fees and royalties for the majority of our revenues. We currently derive nominal revenue from licensing activities and we cannot assure you that we will successfully capitalize on our market opportunities or that our current business strategy will succeed. Factors that may affect our ability to execute our current business strategy including, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 Although we have to date entered into a limited number of settlement and license agreements, we may not be successful in entering into further licensing relationships and existing settlement and license agreements may not generate the financial results we expect;\n\u00b7 Third parties may challenge the validity of our patents;\n\u00b7 The pendency of our various litigations may cause potential licensees not to do business with us;\n\u00b7 We expect that we will face intense competition new and established competitors who may have superior products and services or better marketing, financial or other capacities than we do; and\n\u00b7 It is possible that one or more of our potential customers or licensees develops or otherwise sources products or technologies similar to, competitive with or superior to ours.\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our patent rights, our business would be negatively impacted.\nWe believe our patents are valid, enforceable and valuable. Notwithstanding this belief, third parties may make claims of non-infringement or invalidity claims with respect to our patents and such claims could give rise to material cost for defense or settlement or both, jeopardize or substantially delay a successful outcome of litigation we are or may become involved in, divert resources away from our other activities, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business. Similar challenges could also prevent us from obtaining additional patents in the future. Even if we are successful in enforcing our rights, our patents may not ultimately provide us with any competitive advantages and may be less valuable than we currently expect. These risks may be heightened in countries other than the United States, and may be negatively affected by the fact that legal standards in the United States and elsewhere for protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. In addition, there are a significant number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest, and we expect that significant litigation in these areas will continue, and will add uncertainty to the value of certain patents and other intellectual property rights in our areas of interest. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or otherwise realize value from them, our business would be negatively affected.\nOur litigation can be time-consuming, costly and we cannot anticipate the results.\nWe spend a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue our current litigation matters. We believe that these litigation matters and others that we may in the future determine to pursue could continue for years and continue to consume significant financial and management resources. The counterparties to our litigation are all large, well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than us. We cannot assure you that any of our current or future litigation matters will result in a favorable outcome for us. In addition, even if we obtain favorable interim rulings or verdicts in particular litigation matters, they may not be predictive of the ultimate resolution of the dispute. Also, we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to claims or sanctions against us which may be costly or impossible for us to defend. Any future intellectual property litigation, whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us, is costly, may cause delays (including delays in negotiating licenses with other actual or potential customers). Unfavorable or adverse outcomes may result in losses, exhaustion of financial resources or other adverse effects which could encumber our ability to develop and commercialize products, which may impact our stock price.\nIndex\nWe can provide no assurances that the licensing of our essential security patents under FRAND will be successful.\nAt the request of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), we agreed to update our licensing declaration to ETSI and ATIS under their respective Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policies. This was in response to our Statement of Patent Holder identifying a group of our patents and patent applications that we believe are or may become essential to certain developing specifications in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE), Systems Architecture Evolution (SAE) project. We will make available a non-exclusive patent license under FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions, with compensation) for the patents identified by VirnetX that are or become essential, to applicants desiring to implement the Technical Specifications identified by VirnetX, as set forth in the updated licensing declaration under the ATIS and ETSI IPR policies. While we believe that our FRAND commitment positions us to license our essential security patents for the Technical Specifications identified by VirnetX, our licensing declarations under the ATIS and ETSI IPR policies may limit our flexibility in determining royalties and license terms for certain of our patents. Consequently, we cannot assure you that the licensing of the essential security patents will be successful or that third parties will be willing to enter into licenses with VirnetX on reasonable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our competitive position.\nBecause our business is conducted or expected to be conducted in an environment that is subject to rapid change, we may be subjected to various developments in regulation, law and consumer preferences to which we may not be able to adapt successfully.\nThe current regulatory environment for our products and services remains unclear. We can give no assurance that our planned product offerings will be in compliance with laws and regulations of local, state, United States federal or foreign authorities. Further, we can give no assurance that we will not unintentionally violate such laws or regulations or that such laws or regulations will not be modified, or that new laws or regulations will be enacted in the future which would cause us to be in violation of such laws or regulations. For example, Voice-over-Internet Protocol (or VoIP) services are not currently subject to all of the same regulations that apply to traditional telephony, but it is possible that similar regulations may be applied to VoIP in the future and that these could result in substantial costs and adversely affect the marketability of our products and planned products related to VoIP. Additionally, the use of the Internet and private Internet Protocol (IP) networks for communication is largely unregulated within the United States, but may become regulated in the future; also several foreign governments have enacted measures that could restrict or prohibit voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks.\nMore aggressive domestic or international regulation of the Internet in general, and Internet telephony providers and services specifically, or a lack of growth in acceptance of the Internet as a long term viable marketplace for communications services, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects.\nWe compete in a rapidly changing competitive environment and the success of our business depends upon continued market acceptance and utilization of certain applications and communications channels.\nOur business depends on deployment of Advanced - LTE products and services, the growth of instant messaging, VoIP, mobile services, streaming video, file transfer and remote desktop and other next-generation Internet-based applications which are relatively new. A decline in the use of these applications and communications channels due to complexity or cost of these applications relative to alternate traditional or newly developed communications channels, or development of alternative technologies, could cause a material decline in the number of users in these areas.\nOur exposure to outside influences beyond our control, including new legislation, court rulings or actions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement activities and results of operations.\nOur licensing and enforcement activities are subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including the following:\n\u00b7 New legislation, regulations, court and agency decisions, or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our revenue. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently modified some tests used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in granting patents during the past 20 years which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and increase the likelihood of challenge of any patents we obtain or license. In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Act (\u201cAIA\u201d) has implemented sweeping changes to the United States patent system including changes that transition the United States from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents\n\u00b7 More patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO.\n\u00b7 Federal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nIndex\nIf we experience security breaches, we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer.\nWe expect to retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and secure domain name registry. It will be critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Our secure domain name registry operations will also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption, and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system. The secure domain name servers that we will operate will be critical hardware to our registry services operations. Therefore, we expect to have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and infrastructure. Security technologies are constantly being tested by computer professionals, academics and \u201chackers.\u201d Advances in the techniques for attacking security solutions could make some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable. Likewise, if any of our products are found to have significant security vulnerabilities, then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the vulnerabilities and to repair or replace products already sold or licensed to our customers. Despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems. It is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems. Any physical or electronic break-in or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers. In such an event, we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our services. Such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over IP networks as well as the security or reliability of our services. Additionally, an actual or perceived security breach of our customers or their end-customers, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our data security technologies, could adversely affect the market's perception of our security technologies.\nA security breach could require a substantial amount of expense to rectify and could result in a product liability claim that causes us to incur substantial liability and related legal and other costs. A security breach may also harm our reputation and make it more difficult or impossible for us to successfully market to others. We may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly, or at all. These matters could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe expect that we will experience long and unpredictable sales cycles, which may impact our operating results.\nWe expect that our sales cycles will be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as:\n\u00b7 The need to educate potential customers about our patent rights and our product and service capabilities;\n\u00b7 Customers\u2019 willingness to invest potentially substantial resources and modify their network infrastructures to take advantage of our products;\n\u00b7 Even if successful there can be no assurance that our technologies will be used in a product that is ultimately brought to market, achieves commercial acceptance or results in significant royalties to us;\n\u00b7 Customers\u2019 budgetary constraints;\n\u00b7 The timing of customers\u2019 budget cycles; and\n\u00b7 Delays caused by customers\u2019 internal review processes.\nLong sales cycles may increase the risk that our financial resources are exhausted before we are able to generate significant revenue. If our sales and licensing efforts are very lengthy or unsuccessful, it may adversely affect our business and results of operations as a result of failure to obtain or an undue delay in obtaining royalties.\nWe expect that we will be substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers. If we are unable to establish, maintain or replace our relationships with customers and develop a diversified customer base, our revenues may fluctuate and our growth may be limited.\nOur products Gabriel Secure Communication Platform\u2122 and Gabriel Collaboration Suite\u2122 are expected to be released for sale in the first half of 2015. The revenue from the sale of these products is expected to take some time to ramp before it can contribute a large portion to our overall revenue. Until such time, we expect that in the future, a significant portion of our revenues will be generated from a limited number of customers that have signed Settlement and License Agreements with us over the last few years. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional customers, or if we do so, to sustain our revenue levels from these prospective customers. If we are not able to establish, maintain or replace the limited group of prospective customers that we anticipate may generate a substantial majority of our revenues in the future, or if they do not generate revenues at the levels or at the times that we anticipate, our ability to maintain or grow our revenues will be adversely affected.\nIndex\nOur products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur products are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, could contain errors or defects. Despite rigorous internal and external beta testing, some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers. Any errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty, including claims relating to changes to our products made by our channel partners. The performance of our products could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on third-party applications and services that utilize our services, which could result in legal claims against us, harming our business. Furthermore, we expect to provide implementation, consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our products, which typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and communications systems. We expect that our contracts with customers will contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nCompatibility issues between third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software expose us to a variety of risks we cannot control.\nOur business will also depend upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that we will use to deploy our offerings. We have no control over the operation, quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment. We depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future, our operations could be severely interrupted. Also, to the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products suddenly increases, the technology platform and secure hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times or service interruptions. System interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. In addition, users depend on real-time communications; outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our solution does not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees, strategic partners and customers.\nSystem failure or interruption or our failure to meet increasing demands on our systems could harm our business.\nThe success of our license and service offerings will depend on the uninterrupted operation of various systems, secure data centers and other computer and communication networks that we establish. To the extent that the number of users of networks utilizing our future products suddenly increases, the technology platform and hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times, service interruptions or delays or system failures. Our systems and operations will also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u00b7 power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures;\n\u00b7 damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake, and other natural disasters\n\u00b7 computer viruses or software defects; and\n\u00b7 physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control\nSystem interruptions or failures and increases or delays in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our solution does not function properly or is incapable of adapting to system interruptions, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees, strategic partners and customers.\nAny significant problem with our systems or operations could result in lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction or lawsuits against us. A failure in the operation of our secure domain name registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register and maintain secure domain names for a period of time. A failure in the operation or update of the master directory that we plan to maintain could result in deletion or discontinuation of assigned secure domain names for a period of time. The inability of the registrar systems we establish, including our back office billing and collections infrastructure and telecommunications system, to meet the demands of an increasing number of secure domain name requests, could result in the breakdown of our customer support service to and inhibit our ability to process registration requests in a timely manner.\nIndex\nOur ability to sell our solutions will be dependent on the quality of our technical support, and our failure to deliver high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nIf we do not effectively or are perceived as not effectively assisting our customers in deploying our products, helping them quickly resolve post-deployment issues and providing effective ongoing support, our ability to sell our products would be adversely affected, and our reputation with potential customers could be harmed. In addition, as we expand our operations internationally, our technical support team will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. Our failure to deliver and maintain high-quality technical support services to our customers in the U.S. and internationally could result in customers choosing to use our competitors\u2019 products instead of ours in the future.\nWe rely upon the accuracy of our customers' recordkeeping, and any inaccuracies or payment disputes for amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements may harm our results of operations\nMany of our license agreements require our customers to document the manufacture and sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this data to us. While licenses with such terms give us the right to audit books and records of our customers to verify this information, audits rarely are undertaken because they can be expensive, time consuming, and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our customers. Therefore, we typically rely on the accuracy of the reports from customers without independently verifying the information in them. Our failure to audit our customers' books and records may result in our receiving more or less royalty revenue than we are entitled to under the terms of our license agreements. If we conduct royalty audits in the future, such audits may trigger disagreements over contract terms with our customers and such disagreements could hamper customer relations, divert the efforts and attention of our management from normal operations and impact our business operations and financial condition.\nTelephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to enforce regulatory tariffs, which, if granted, would increase the cost of online communication, and such an increase in cost may impede the growth of online communication and adversely affect our business.\nUse of the Internet has over-burdened existing telecommunications infrastructures, and many high traffic areas have begun to experience interruptions in service. As a result, certain local telephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to enforce regulatory tariffs on IP telephony traffic that crosses over their traditional telephone networks. If the relief sought in these petitions is granted, the costs of communicating via online could increase substantially, potentially adversely affecting the growth in the use of online secure communications. Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe departure of Kendall Larsen, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and/or other key personnel could compromise our ability to execute our strategic plan and may result in additional severance costs to us.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our key personnel, including Kendall Larsen, our Chief Executive Officer and President. We have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving us at any time. The loss of the services of any key employees could be disruptive to our ability to execute our strategic plan and could cause our business and operations to suffer. In addition, we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees. The loss of Mr. Larsen, or our failure to retain other key personnel, would jeopardize our ability to execute our strategic plan and materially harm our business.\nWe will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified operations, marketing, engineering, sales and executive personnel as well as engineers. Inability to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business. Competition for operations, marketing, engineering, sales and executive personnel is intense, particularly in the technology sector and in the region in which our facility is located. We can provide no assurance that we will attract or retain such personnel.\nOur consolidated financial statements were restated in 2011 in connection with our identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; we may identify future material weaknesses which may result in late filings, increased costs or declines in our share price.\nIn early 2011, we restated our previously filed financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2010, each of the then previous five fiscal quarters and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, to adjust our accounting for our Series I Warrants. In connection with these restatements, we determined that we had not maintained effective control over our accounting for these Series I Warrants and, as a result, that a material weakness existed with respect to our reporting of complex, non-routine transactions as of the end of the periods covered by the Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs that included the financial statements referenced above. Although we believe that we currently maintain effective control over our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as regards this issue, we may in the future identify deficiencies regarding the design and effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting. If we experience any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future or are unable to provide unqualified management or attestation reports about our internal controls, we may be unable to meet financial and other reporting deadlines and may incur costs associated with remediation, any of which could cause our share price to decline.\nIndex\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.\nAlthough we paid a special cash dividend to holders of our common stock in 2010, we do not pay regular dividends on our common stock. Instead, we intend to retain our cash and future earnings, if any, to fund our business plan. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and the decision to declare a dividend will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and investment opportunities. We therefore cannot determine whether our Board of Directors will determine to pay regular or special dividends in the future. Accordingly, unless our Board of Directors determines to pay dividends, stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock, which may or may not occur, to realize a gain on their investment.\nThe exercise of our outstanding stock options would result in a dilution of our current stockholders' voting power and an increase in the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market which may negatively impact the market price of our stock.\nThe exercise of our outstanding vested stock options would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding options and restricted stock units to purchase an aggregate of 4,806,922 shares of common stock (representing 9.24% of our total shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014) of which 3,975,630 are vested and therefore exercisable. To the extent outstanding stock options are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, and such issuance would dilute non-exercising stockholders' percentage voting interests and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market.\nThe fair value of accounting for our Series I Warrants as derivative liabilities may materially impact our results of our operations in future periods.\nWe record the Series I Warrants as a derivative liability in accordance with ASC 815-40, \u201cDerivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity.\u201d These derivative liabilities are reported at fair value each reporting period with changes in the fair value recognized as gain or loss during each reporting period. An increase in our share price or measure of our share price volatility, for example, will generally result in an increase in the fair value of our warrant liability and a non-cash charge during the period of such increase, which could materially and negatively impact our results of operations in future periods.\nTrading in our common shares is limited and the price of our common shares may be subject to substantial volatility, particularly in light of the instability in the financial and capital markets.\nOur common stock is listed on NYSE MKT LLC, but its daily trading volume has been limited, sporadic and volatile. Over the past years the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations. Between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014, the reported last sale price for our common stock ranged between $4.09 and $20.93 per share. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 developments in any then-outstanding litigation;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 large purchases or sales of common stock or derivatives transactions related to our stock;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated announcements of new products or services by us or competitors;\n\u00b7 general conditions in the markets in which we compete; and\n\u00b7 economic and financial conditions\nThe market price of our common stock may decline because our operating results may not be consistent and may be difficult to predict.\nOur reported net income has fluctuated in the past due to several factors. We expect that our future operating results may also fluctuate due to the same or similar factors. We had a net loss $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a net loss of $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and a net loss of $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 with an accumulated deficit of $100.4 million. The following include some of the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate:\n\u00b7 the outcome of actions to enforce our intellectual property rights currently in progress or that we may undertake in the future, and the timing thereof;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of receipt of license fees from potential infringers, licensees or customers;\nIndex\n\u00b7 the rate of adoption of our patented technologies;\n\u00b7 the number of new license arrangements we may execute, or that may expire, within a particular period and the scope of those licenses, including the number of our patents which are licensed, the extent of prior infringement of our patent rights, royalty rates, timing of payment obligations, expiration date etc.;\n\u00b7 the success of a licensee in selling products that use our patented technologies; and\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of expenses related to our patent filings and enforcement proceedings, including litigation, related to our intellectual property rights\nThese fluctuations may make our business particularly difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, make our operating results difficult for investors to predict and, further, cause our results to fall below investor\u2019s expectations and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nBecause ownership of our common stock is concentrated, investors may have limited influence on stockholder decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 18% of our then outstanding common stock. In addition, a group of stockholders that, as of December 31, 2007, held 4,766,666 shares, or approximately 11%, of our then outstanding common stock, have entered into a voting agreement with us that requires them to vote all of their shares of our voting stock in favor of the director nominees approved by our Board of Directors at each director election going forward, and in a manner that is proportional to the votes cast by all other voting shares as to any other matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote. However, we cannot be certain how many shares of our common stock this group of stockholders currently owns. Because of their beneficial ownership interest, our officers and directors could significantly influence stockholder actions of which you disapprove or that are contrary to your interests. This ability to exercise significant influence could prevent or significantly delay another company from acquiring or merging with us.\nOur protective provisions could make it difficult for a third party to successfully acquire us even if you would like to sell your stock to them.\nWe have a number of protective provisions that could delay, discourage or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. Our protective provisions include:\n\u00b7 A staggered Board of Directors: This means that only one or two directors (since we have a five-person Board of Directors) will be up for election at any given annual meeting. This has the effect of delaying the ability of stockholders to effect a change in control of us because it would take two annual meetings to effectively replace a majority of the Board of Directors.\n\u00b7 Blank check preferred stock: Our Board of Directors has the authority to establish the rights, preferences and privileges of our 10,000,000 authorized, but unissued, shares of preferred stock. Therefore, this stock may be issued at the discretion of our Board of Directors with preferences over your shares of our common stock in a manner that is materially dilutive to you. In addition, blank check preferred stock can be used to create a \u201cpoison pill\u201d which is designed to deter a hostile bidder from buying a controlling interest in our stock without the approval of our Board of Directors. We have not adopted such a \u201cpoison pill;\u201d but our Board of Directors has the ability to do so in the future, very rapidly and without stockholder approval.\n\u00b7 Advance notice requirements for director nominations and for new business to be brought up at stockholder meetings: Stockholders wishing to submit director nominations or raise matters to a vote of the stockholders must provide notice to us within very specific date windows and in very specific form in order to have the matter voted on at a stockholder meeting. This has the effect of giving our Board of Directors and management more time to react to stockholder proposals generally and could also have the effect of disregarding a stockholder proposal or deferring it to a subsequent meeting to the extent such proposal is not raised properly.\n\u00b7 No stockholder actions by written consent: No stockholder or group of stockholders may take actions rapidly and without prior notice to our Board of Directors and management or to the minority stockholders. Along with the advance notice requirements described above, this provision also gives our Board of Directors and management more time to react to proposed stockholder actions.\n\u00b7 Super majority requirement for stockholder amendments to the By-laws: Stockholder proposals to alter or amend our By-laws or to adopt new By-laws can only be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\n\u00b7 No ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders: Only the Board of Directors or management can call special meetings of the stockholders. This could mean that stockholders, even those who represent a significant percentage of our shares of common stock, may need to wait for the annual meeting before nominating directors or raising other business proposals to be voted on by the stockholders.\nIndex\nIn addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law govern us. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our By-laws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.", "PERMNO": 87084, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "VHC"}
