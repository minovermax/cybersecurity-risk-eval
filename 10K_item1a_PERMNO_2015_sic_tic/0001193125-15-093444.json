RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information contained in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business.\nOur workers\u2019 compensation loss reserves may be inadequate to cover our ultimate liability for workers\u2019 compensation costs.\nWe maintain reserves (recorded as accrued liabilities on our balance sheet) to cover our estimated liabilities for our workers\u2019 compensation claims under our insurance arrangement with ACE in California, our self-insured status in Oregon, Delaware, Maryland and Colorado and our captive insurance subsidiary Ecole in Arizona. The determination of these reserves is based upon a number of factors, including current and historical claims activity, claims payment patterns and medical cost trends and developments in existing claims. Accordingly, reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Reserves may be affected by both internal and external events, such as adverse developments on existing claims or changes in medical costs, medical condition of the claimant, claims handling procedures, administrative costs and legal fees, inflation, and legal trends and legislative changes. Reserves are adjusted from time to time to reflect new claims, claim developments, or systemic changes, and such adjustments are reflected in the results of the periods in which the reserves are changed Our revenues include an additional component for both estimated future adverse loss development in excess of initial case reserves on open claims and for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial estimates provided by the Company\u2019s independent actuary The estimated accrual does not include an estimated provision for the incidence of unknown catastrophic claims. Moreover, because of the uncertainties that surround estimating workers\u2019 compensation loss reserves, we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate. If our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses, we would have to increase our reserves and incur charges to our earnings that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Workers\u2019 Compensation\u201d above for additional information.\n- 11 -\nOur retention for workers\u2019 compensation claims is $5.0 million per occurrence under our insurance arrangement with ACE in California as well as in the majority of our self-insured states.\nIn view of the Company\u2019s favorable historical experience with large catastrophic claims and an opportunity to realize savings from lower excess workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums, we maintain our retention at $5.0 million per occurrence, except in Colorado and Maryland where our retention is at $2.0 million and $1.0 million per occurrence, respectively. Additionally, Ecole\u2019s retention is at $5.0 million per occurrence for coverage in Arizona. Thus, the Company has financial risk for most workers\u2019 compensation claims under $5.0 million, on a per occurrence basis. This level of per occurrence retention may result in higher workers\u2019 compensation costs to us with a corresponding negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAdverse developments in the market for excess workers\u2019 compensation insurance could lead to increases in our costs.\nWe are a state-approved self-insured employer for workers\u2019 compensation coverage in Oregon, Delaware, Maryland and Colorado, as well as in Washington for our staffing and management employees. To manage our financial exposure in the event of catastrophic injuries or fatalities, we maintain excess workers\u2019 compensation insurance with a per occurrence retention of $5.0 million effective January 1, 2007, except in Colorado and Maryland where our retention is at $2.0 million and $1.0 million per occurrence, respectively. Additionally, Ecole\u2019s retention is at $5.0 million per occurrence for coverage in Arizona. Changes in the market for excess workers\u2019 compensation insurance may lead to limited availability of such coverage, additional increases in our insurance costs or further increases in our self-insured retention, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur ability to continue our business operations in California is dependent on maintaining workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage.\nWe recently renewed our workers\u2019 compensation insurance arrangement with ACE for our employees in California. The annual renewal extends through February 1, 2016, with the possibility of additional annual renewals. If ACE is unwilling or unable to renew our arrangement in the future, we would need to seek alternative coverage. If replacement coverage were unavailable or available only on significantly less favorable terms, our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with geographic market concentration.\nOur California operations accounted for approximately 77% of our total net revenues in 2014. As a result of the current importance of our California operations and anticipated continued growth from these operations, our profitability over the next several years is expected to be largely dependent on economic and regulatory conditions in California. If California experiences an economic downturn, or if the regulatory environment changes in a way that adversely affects our ability to do business or limits our competitive advantages, our profitability and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n- 12 -\nEconomic conditions, particularly in California, may impact our ability to attract new clients and cause our existing clients to reduce staffing levels or cease operations.\nWeak economic conditions typically have a negative impact on small-and mid-sized businesses, which make up the majority of our clients. In turn, these businesses could cut costs, including trimming employees from their payrolls, or ceasing operations altogether. These forces may result in decreased revenues due both to the downsizing of our current clients and difficulties in attracting new clients, and may also result in additional bad debt expense to the extent that existing clients cease operations.\nWe may be unable to draw on our revolving credit facility in the future.\nAs discussed in more detail in Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report, we maintain a credit agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with our principal bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the \u201cBank\u201d). The Agreement, which expires October 1, 2017, provides for a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $14.0 million at December 31, 2014, to be used to finance working capital; there was no outstanding balance at that date. The Agreement also provides a term loan in the principal amount of $40.0 million maturing December 31, 2016, which we used to fund our workers\u2019 compensation insurance reserves at December 31, 2014, as well as a standby letter of credit agreement providing for a total of approximately $114.0 million in cash-secured letters of credit and a term loan with a balance of approximately $5.1 million secured by our company office building in Vancouver, Washington.\nIf our business does not perform as expected, including if we generate less revenue than anticipated from our operations or encounter significant unexpected costs, we may fail to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facilities. If we do not comply with our financial covenants and we do not obtain a waiver or amendment from the Bank, the Bank may elect to cause all amounts owed to become immediately due and payable. In this event, we would seek to establish a replacement credit facility with one or more other lenders, including lenders with which we have an existing relationship, potentially at less desirable terms. There can be no guarantee that replacement financing would be available at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and working capital.\nIf we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers. Service quality issues, actual or perceived, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies. Also, adverse publicity surrounding labor relations, data breaches, securities class actions, and the like, or attempts to connect our Company to these types of issues, could negatively affect our overall reputation. Damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\n- 13 -\nOur staffing business is vulnerable to economic fluctuations.\nDemand for our staffing services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity in the regions in which we do business. As economic activity slows down, companies often reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of permanent staff, resulting in decreased demand for staffing services. During strong economic periods, on the other hand, we often experience shortages of qualified employees to meet customer needs.\nBecause we assume the obligation to make wage, tax and regulatory payments in respect of some employees, we are exposed to client credit risks.\nWe generally assume responsibility for and manage the risks associated with our clients\u2019 employee payroll obligations, including liability for payment of salaries and wages (including payroll taxes), as well as group health and retirement benefits. These obligations are fixed, whether or not the client makes payments to us as required by our services agreement, which exposes us to credit risks. We attempt to mitigate this risk by invoicing our clients at the end of their specific payroll processing cycle. We also carefully monitor the timeliness of our clients\u2019 payments and impose strict credit standards on our customers. If we fail to successfully manage our credit risk, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreases in unemployment claims could raise our state and federal unemployment tax rates which we may not be able to pass on to our customers.\nDuring weak economic conditions in our markets, the level of unemployment claims tend to rise as a result of employee layoffs at our clients and lack of work in our temporary staffing pool. The rise in unemployment claims often results in higher state and federal unemployment tax rates which in most instances cannot be concurrently passed on to our customers either due to existing client services agreements or competitive pricing pressures. Increases in our state and federal unemployment tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly in the early part of the calendar year when effective payroll tax rates are at or near their maximum.\nIf we are determined not to be an \u201cemployer\u201d under certain laws and regulations, our clients may stop using our services, and we may be subject to additional liabilities.\nWe are the administrative employer in our co-employment relationships under the various laws and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Labor. If we are determined not to be the administrative employer under such laws and regulations and are therefore unable to assume our clients\u2019 obligations for employment and other taxes, our clients may be held jointly and severally liable for payment of such taxes. Some clients or prospective clients may view such potential liability as an unacceptable risk, discouraging current clients from continuing a relationship with us or prospective clients from entering into a new relationship with us. Any determination that we are not the administrative employer for purposes of ERISA could adversely affect our cafeteria benefits plan operated under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code and result in liabilities to us under the plan.\n- 14 -\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs and periodic litigation that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe either co-employ employees in connection with our client services agreements or place our employees in our customers\u2019 workplace in connection with our staffing business. As such, we are subject to a number of risks inherent to our status as the administrative employer, including without limitation:\n\u2022\nclaims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our employees, discrimination or harassment claims against our employees, or claims by our employees of discrimination or harassment by our clients;\n\u2022\nimmigration-related claims;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to violations of wage, hour and other workplace regulations;\n\u2022\nclaims relating to employee benefits, entitlements to employee benefits, or errors in the calculation or administration of such benefits; and\n\u2022\npossible claims relating to misuse of customer confidential information, misappropriation of assets or other similar claims.\nIf we experience significant incidents involving any of the above-described risk areas we could face substantial out-of-pocket losses, fines or negative publicity. In addition, such claims may give rise to litigation, which may be time consuming, distracting and costly, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. With respect to claims involving our co-employer relationships, although our client services agreement provides that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to the conduct of the client or its employees, we may not be able to enforce such contractual indemnification, or the client may not have sufficient assets to satisfy its obligations to us.\nWe are dependent upon technology services and if we experience damage, service interruptions or failures in our computer and telecommunications systems, our client relationships and our ability to attract new clients may be adversely affected.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our branch network, perform employment-related services, accounting and reporting, and summarize and analyze our financial results. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from telecommunications failures, power-related outages, computer viruses and malicious attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage our operations, and encounter a loss of client confidence. In addition, our clients\u2019 businesses may be adversely affected by any system or equipment failure or breach we experience. As a result, our relationships with our clients may be impaired, we may lose clients, our ability to attract new clients may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to contractual liability. We may invest in upgrades or replacements to our existing systems or additional security measures, each of which can involve substantial costs and risks relating to installation and implementation.\n- 15 -\nIf our efforts to protect the security of personal information about our employees and clients are unsuccessful, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of personal and proprietary information about thousands of employees and some clients. If we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. In addition, our employees and clients could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal and proprietary information, which could cause them to terminate their relationships with us. Any loss of confidence arising from a significant data security breach could hurt our reputation, further damaging our business.\nWe operate in a complex regulatory environment, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nCorporate human resource operations are subject to a broad range of complex and evolving laws and regulations, including those applicable to payroll practices, benefits administration, employment practices and privacy. Because our clients have employees in many states throughout the United States, we must perform our services in compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions. Some of these laws and regulations may be difficult to ascertain or interpret and may change from time to time. Violation of such laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, damage our reputation, constitute a breach of our client agreements, impair our ability to obtain and renew required licenses, and decrease our profitability or competitiveness. If any of these effects were to occur, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChanges in government regulations may result in restrictions or prohibitions applicable to the provision of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing, regulatory or tax requirements.\nOur business is heavily regulated in most jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot assure you that the states in which we conduct or seek to conduct business will not:\n\u2022\nimpose additional regulations that prohibit or restrict employment-related businesses like ours;\n\u2022\nrequire additional licensing or add restrictions on existing licenses to provide employment-related services; or\n\u2022\nincrease taxes or make changes in the way in which taxes are calculated for providers of employment-related services.\nAny changes in applicable laws and regulations may make it more difficult or expensive for us to do business, inhibit expansion of our business, or result in additional expenses that limit our profitability or decrease our ability to attract and retain clients.\n- 16 -\nThe tax status of our insurance subsidiaries could be challenged resulting in an acceleration of income tax payments.\nIn conjunction with our workers\u2019 compensation program, we operate two wholly owned insurance subsidiaries, AICE and Ecole. We treat the two subsidiaries as insurance companies for federal income tax purposes, with respect to our consolidated federal income tax return. In the event the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) were to determine that the subsidiaries do not qualify as insurance companies, we could be required to make accelerated income tax payments to the IRS that we otherwise would have deferred until future periods.\nWe may find it difficult to expand our business into additional states due to varying state regulatory requirements.\nFuture growth in our operations depends, in part, on our ability to offer our services to prospective clients in new states, which may subject us to different regulatory requirements and standards. In order to operate effectively in a new state, we must obtain all necessary regulatory approvals, adapt our procedures to that state\u2019s regulatory requirements and modify our service offerings to adapt to local market conditions. In the event that we expand into additional states, we may not be able to duplicate in other markets the financial performance experienced in our current markets.\nAcquisitions subject us to various risks, including risks relating to selection and pricing of acquisition targets, integration of acquired companies into our business and assumption of unanticipated liabilities.\nWe have completed 27 acquisitions since 1993 and may pursue additional acquisitions and investment opportunities. We cannot assure, however, that we will be able to identify or complete additional acquisitions. If we do pursue acquisitions, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Acquisitions involve many risks, including risks relating to the assumption of unforeseen liabilities of an acquired business, adverse accounting charges resulting from the acquisition, and difficulties in integrating acquired companies into our business, both from a cultural perspective, as well as with respect to personnel and client retention and technological integration. Acquired liabilities may be significant and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses may lead to increased costs, failure to generate expected returns, accounting charges, or even a total loss of amounts invested, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition from a number of other companies.\nWe face competition from various companies that may provide all or some of the services we offer. Our competitors include companies that are engaged in staffing services such as Kelly Services, Inc. and Manpower Inc., companies that are focused on co-employment, such as Insperity, Inc. and companies that primarily provide payroll processing services, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Paychex, Inc. We also face competition from information technology outsourcing firms and broad-based outsourcing and consulting firms that perform individual projects.\n- 17 -\nSeveral of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do, which may enable them to:\n\u2022\ndevelop and expand their infrastructure and service offerings more quickly and achieve greater cost efficiencies;\n\u2022\ninvest in new technologies;\n\u2022\nexpand operations into new markets more rapidly;\n\u2022\ndevote greater resources to marketing;\n\u2022\ncompete for acquisitions more effectively and complete acquisitions more easily; and\n\u2022\naggressively price products and services and increase benefits in ways that we may not be able to match financially.\nIn order to compete effectively in our markets, we must target our potential clients carefully, continue to improve our efficiencies and the scope and quality of our services, and rely on our service quality, innovation, education and program clarity. If our competitive advantages are not compelling or sustainable, then we are unlikely to increase or sustain profits and our stock price could decline.\nWe are dependent upon certain key personnel and recruitment and retention of key employees may be difficult and expensive.\nWe believe that the successful operation of our business is dependent upon our retention of the services of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers and area managers. We may not be able to retain all of our executives, senior managers and key personnel in light of competition for their services. If we lose the services of one of our executive officers or a significant number of our senior managers, our operations and profitability likely would be adversely affected.\nWe do not have an expansive in-house sales staff and therefore rely extensively on referral partners.\nWe maintain a minimal internal professional sales force and we rely heavily on referral partners to provide referrals to new business, especially in California, although each area manager is expected to be an effective leader in business development, including marketing efforts and sales closures. In connection with these arrangements, we pay a fee to referral partners for new clients. As a result, we are dependent on firms and individuals that do not have an exclusive relationship with us. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, or if they increase their fees or lose confidence in our services, we could face declines in our business and additional costs and uncertainties as we attempt to hire and train an internal sales force.\nWe depend on attracting and retaining qualified employees; during periods of economic growth, our costs to do so increase and it becomes more difficult to attract and retain people.\nThe success of our staffing services depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees for placement with our customers. Our ability to attract and retain\n- 18 -\nqualified personnel could be impaired by rapid improvement in economic conditions resulting in lower unemployment and increases in compensation. During periods of economic growth, we face growing competition for retaining and recruiting qualified personnel, which in turn leads to greater advertising and recruiting costs and increased salary expenses. If we cannot attract and retain qualified employees, the quality of our services may deteriorate and our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur service agreements may be terminated on short notice, leaving us vulnerable to loss of a significant amount of customers in a short period of time, if business or regulatory conditions change or events occur that negatively affect our reputation.\nOur client services agreements are generally terminable on 30 days\u2019 notice by either us or the client. As a result, our clients may terminate their agreement with us at any time, making us particularly vulnerable to changing business or regulatory conditions or changes affecting our reputation or the reputation of our industry.\nOur industry has at times received negative publicity that, if it were to become more prevalent, could cause our business to decline.\nIn the industries in which we compete, companies periodically have been tarnished by negative publicity or scandals from poor business judgment or even outright fraud. If we or our industry face negative publicity, customers\u2019 confidence in the use of temporary personnel or co-employed workers may deteriorate, and they may be unwilling to enter into or continue our staffing or co-employment relationships. If a negative perception were to prevail, it would be more difficult for us to attract and retain customers.\nChanges in state unemployment tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nIn past years, there has been significant negative publicity relating to the use of staffing or PEO companies to shield employers from poor unemployment history and high unemployment taxes. New legislation enacted at the state or federal level to try to counter this perceived problem could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to market our services or making our services less attractive to our customers and potential customers.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal or administrative actions that could adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nAs described in more detail in Item 3 of this Report and in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Report, three lawsuits purporting to be class actions brought on behalf of all of BBSI\u2019s stockholders have been filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against BBSI and BBSI\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The actions allege violations of the federal securities laws based on claims arising from the decline in the market price for our common stock following announcement of a charge for increased workers compensation reserves expense in the 2014 third quarter. In addition, in February 2015, we received a letter from counsel from a stockholder threatening to commence a shareholder derivative action on\n- 19 -\nbehalf of the Company based on the same facts as the three lawsuits already filed, as well as that certain officers and directors sold shares of BBSI common stock while in possession of material non-public information.\nThe results of legal proceedings against us, including those described above, if decided adversely to us or to our directors or officers, could result in significant monetary damages or penalties or reputational harm, and could involve significant defense or other costs. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and our corporate charter requires us to indemnify each of our officers and directors against all liabilities, losses, judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses arising out of their actions in such capacities to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law. Although we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations, our insurance coverage may not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us, or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, including pursuant to our indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nMaryland law and our Charter and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of the Company more difficult.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law and our Charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring the Company, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions of our Charter and bylaws:\n\u2022\npermit the Board of Directors to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences, including voting rights, as the Board may establish, without further approval by the Company\u2019s stockholders, which could also adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nvest the power to adopt, alter or repeal the Company\u2019s bylaws solely in the Board of Directors; the stockholders do not have that power.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to the Maryland control share act (the \u201cControl Share Act\u201d). Under the Control Share Act, a person (an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d) who acquires voting stock in a transaction (a \u201cControl Share Acquisition\u201d) which results in its holding voting power within specified ranges cannot vote the shares it acquires in the Control Share Acquisition unless voting rights are accorded to such control shares by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares, excluding the Acquiring Person and the Company\u2019s officers and directors who are also employees of the Company.\nThe Company is also subject to the provisions of Maryland law limiting the ability of certain Maryland corporations to engage in specified business combinations (the \u201cBusiness Combination Act\u201d). Subject to certain exceptions, the Business Combination Act prohibits a Maryland corporation from engaging in a business combination with a stockholder who, with its affiliates, owns 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. These provisions will not apply to business combinations that are approved by the Board of Directors before the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\n- 20 -", "PERMNO": 79249, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "BBSI"}
