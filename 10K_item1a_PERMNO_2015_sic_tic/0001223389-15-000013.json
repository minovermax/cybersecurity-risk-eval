{"cik": "1223389", "company": "CONNS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following discussion of risk factors may be important information in understanding our \"forward-looking statements,\" which are discussed in Item 7 in this Form 10-K and elsewhere. These risk factors should also be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K.\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below, as well as other information presented in this Form 10-K and in other reports, registration statements and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing our revenues depends on opening new stores and we may not be able to open and profitably operate new stores in existing, adjacent and new geographic markets. In fiscal year 2015, we opened 18 new stores and have plans to open 15 to 18 new stores in fiscal year 2016. New stores may not be profitable on an operating basis during the first several months after they open and even after that time period may not be profitable or meet our goals which could result in our financial results to be materially adversely affected. There are a number of factors that could affect our ability to implement our new store opening program and growth strategy, including:\n\u2022\nDifficulties associated with the hiring, training and retention of skilled personnel, including store managers;\n\u2022\nThe availability of financial resources;\n\u2022\nThe availability of favorable sites in existing, adjacent and new markets at price levels consistent with our business plan;\n\u2022\nCompetition in existing, adjacent and new markets;\n\u2022\nCompetitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns in adjacent and new markets that are different from those in our existing markets;\n\u2022\nA lack of consumer demand for our products or financing programs at levels that can support new store growth;\n\u2022\nInability to make customer financing programs available that allow consumers to purchase products at levels that can support new store growth;\n\u2022\nLimitations created by covenants and conditions under our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes;\n\u2022\nAn inability or unwillingness of vendors to supply product on a timely basis at competitive prices;\n\u2022\nThe failure to open enough stores in new markets to achieve a sufficient market presence and realize the benefits of leveraging our advertising and our distribution system;\n\u2022\nUnfamiliarity with local real estate markets and demographics in adjacent and new markets;\n\u2022\nProblems in adapting our distribution and other operational and management systems to an expanded network of stores; and\n\u2022\nHigher costs for mail, television, print, radio or internet advertising.\nThese factors may also affect the ability of any newly opened stores to achieve sales and profitability levels comparable with our existing stores or to become profitable at all. As a result, we may determine that we need to close additional stores or reduce the hours of operation in some stores, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows, as we may incur additional expenses and non-cash write-offs related to closing a store and settling our remaining lease obligations and our initial investment in fixed assets and related store costs.\nWe are exploring the sale of all or a portion of our loan portfolio, or other refinancing of the Company's loan portfolio, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing a transaction or that such a transaction will yield additional value for our stockholders or that the transaction will not have an adverse impact on our business. In October 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized management to explore a full range of strategic alternatives to enhance value for stockholders, including, but not limited to, a sale of the Company, separating its retail and credit businesses or slowing store openings and returning capital to investors. The Company and its advisors have conducted a thorough review of strategic alternatives, including alternatives not identified in the October announcement. After appropriate diligence and consideration, the\nBoard of Directors has authorized management to actively pursue the sale of all or a portion of the loan portfolio, or other refinancing of our loan portfolio. We have engaged BofA Merrill Lynch and Stephens Inc., as financial advisors, to assist with this process.\nThere is no assurance that we will complete a sale of all or a portion of the loan portfolio, or other refinancing, and no timetable has been set for completion of this process. The Board of Directors may also determine that no transaction is in the best interests of shareholders. We do not intend to comment further regarding the process, or any specific transaction, until such time as the Board of Directors deems disclosure is appropriate or necessary. Further, it is not certain what impact any potential transaction, or a decision not to pursue any potential transaction, may have on our stock price, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, or business prospects.\nWe expect to incur substantial costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential transactions. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third-parties in our business, and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms. The process of exploring a transaction may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations. We are also subject to other risks in connection with the uncertainty created by the review process, including stock price volatility, ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we are unable to effectively manage the review process, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to manage the growth of our business, our revenues may not increase, our cost of operations may rise and our results of operations may decline. As we grow our store base, we will face many business risks associated with growing companies, including the risk that our management, financial controls and information systems will be inadequate to support our expansion in the future. Our growth will require management to expend significant time and effort and additional resources to ensure the continuing adequacy of our financial controls, operating procedures, information systems, product purchasing, warehousing and distribution systems and employee training programs. We cannot predict whether we will be able to effectively manage these increased demands or respond on a timely basis to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management, financial controls and information systems. If we fail to successfully manage the challenges of growth, do not continue to improve our systems and controls or encounter unexpected difficulties during expansion, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may expand our retail or credit offerings which may have different operating or legal requirements than our current operations. In addition to the retail and consumer finance products we currently offer, we may offer other products and services in the future, including new financing products and services. These products and services may require additional or different operating and compliance systems or have additional or different legal or regulatory requirements than the products and services we currently offer. In the event we undertake such an expansion and do not have the proper infrastructure or personnel, do not successfully execute such an expansion, or our customers do not positively respond to such changes, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAn increase in interest rates, a decrease in our credit sales or a decline in credit quality could lead to a decrease in our product sales and profitability. A large portion of our credit portfolio is to customers considered to be sub-prime borrowers, who have limited credit history, low income or past credit problems. Entering into credit arrangements with such customers entail a higher risk of customer default, higher delinquency rates and higher losses than extending credit to more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing and the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to manage the higher risks inherent in issuing credit with sub-prime customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. We have experienced volatility in delinquency and charge-off rates on our credit contracts. Payments on some of our credit accounts become delinquent from time to time, and some accounts end up in default, due to several factors, such as general and local economic conditions, including the impact of rising interest rates and unemployment rates. As we continue to expand into new markets, we will obtain new credit accounts that may present a higher risk than our existing credit accounts since new credit customers do not have an established credit history with us.\nA general decline in the quality of our customer receivable portfolio could lead to a reduction in the advance rates used or eligible customer receivable balances included in the borrowing base calculations under our revolving credit facility and thus a reduction of available credit to fund our finance operations. As a result, if we are required to reduce the amount of credit we grant to our customers, we most likely would sell fewer products, which could result in our financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected. Further, because 47.3% of our credit account payments received during fiscal year 2015 were delivered to one of our store locations, any decrease in credit sales could reduce traffic in our stores and lower our revenues. A decline in the credit quality of our credit accounts could also cause an increase in our credit losses, which would result in an adverse effect on our earnings. A decline in credit quality could also lead to stricter underwriting criteria which could have a negative impact on net sales.\nWe maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts on our customer installment contracts held on our balance sheet. If the allowance for uncollectible accounts is inadequate, we would recognize the losses in excess of the allowance and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the qualified sales and credit granting and collection personnel required for our business, our operating results could suffer. Our success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and continued service of our key executives or the identification of suitable successors for them. If we lose the services of any of these individuals, or if one or more of them or other key personnel decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, and we are unable to identify a suitable successor, our business and operations could be harmed, and we could have difficulty in implementing our strategy. In addition, our sales and credit operations are largely dependent upon our labor force. As our business grows, and as we incur turnover in current positions, we will need to locate, hire and retain additional qualified sales personnel in a timely manner and develop, train and manage an increasing number of management level sales associates and other employees. Additionally, if we are unable to attract and retain qualified credit granting and collection personnel, our ability to perform quality underwriting of new credit transactions and maintain workloads for our collections personnel at a manageable level, our operation could be materially adversely impacted and result in higher delinquency and net charge-offs on our credit portfolio. Competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees, and increases in the federal minimum wage or other employee benefits costs could increase our operating expenses. If we are unable to attract and retain personnel as needed in the future, our net sales and operating results could suffer.\nWe have significant future capital needs and the inability to access the capital markets may materially adversely affect our business and expansion plans. As of January 31, 2015, we primarily finance our customer receivables through a revolving credit facility with a capacity of $880.0 million that matures in November 2017. We had $529.2 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, including standby letters of credit issued as of January 31, 2015. In addition, on July 1, 2014, we issued $250.0 million in senior unsecured notes due July 2022. Our ability to raise additional capital through expansion of our revolving credit facility, securitization transactions or other debt or equity transactions, and do so on economically favorable terms, depends in large part on factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nConditions in the securities and finance markets generally;\n\u2022\nOur credit rating or the credit rating of any securities we may issue;\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nConditions in the markets for securitized instruments, or other debt or equity instruments;\n\u2022\nThe credit quality and performance of our customer receivables;\n\u2022\nOur overall sales performance and profitability;\n\u2022\nOur ability to provide or obtain financial support for required credit enhancement;\n\u2022\nOur ability to adequately service our financial instruments;\n\u2022\nOur ability to meet debt covenant requirements; and\n\u2022\nPrevailing interest rates.\nIf adequate capital and funds are not available at the time we need capital, we may have to curtail future growth, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow. The ultimate amount of capital expenditures needed will be dependent on, among other factors, the availability of capital to fund new store openings and customer receivables portfolio growth.\nIn addition, we historically used our customer receivables as collateral to support our capital needs. If we require amendments in the future and are unable to obtain such amendments or we are unable to arrange substitute financing facilities or other sources of capital, we may have to limit or cease offering credit through our finance programs due to our inability to draw under our revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of a default. If availability under the borrowing base calculations of our revolving credit facility is reduced, or otherwise becomes unavailable, or we are unable to arrange substitute financing facilities or other sources of capital, we may have to limit the amount of credit that we make available through our customer credit programs. A reduction in our ability to offer customer credit could materially adversely affect revenues and results of operations. Further, our inability or limitations on our ability to obtain funding through securitization facilities or other sources may materially adversely affect our profitability under our credit programs if existing customers fail to repay outstanding credit due to our refusal to grant additional credit. Additionally, the inability of any of the financial institutions providing our financing facilities to fund their commitment could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our credit programs, capital expenditures and other general corporate needs.\nWe have in the past, and may again in the future, access the debt or other capital markets to refinance existing debt obligations and to obtain capital to finance growth. Our future access to the capital markets could become restricted due to a variety of factors, including a deterioration of our earnings, cash flows, balance sheet quality, regulatory restrictions or overall business or industry prospects, a significant deterioration in the state of the capital markets or a negative bias toward our industry by market participants. In addition, we may elect to issue securities for which we may seek to obtain a rating from a rating agency. It is possible, however, that one or more rating agencies might independently determine to assign a rating to any of our issued debt securities. If any ratings are assigned to any of our debt or other securities with a rating, such ratings, if they are lower than market expectations or are subsequently lowered or withdrawn, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. Inability to access the credit markets on acceptable terms, if at all, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we do not comply with the covenants in the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility and the indenture that will govern our senior notes, we may not have the funds necessary to pay all of our indebtedness that could become due. The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nIncur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nPay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our capital stock;\n\u2022\nPrepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nMake loans and certain investments;\n\u2022\nSell assets;\n\u2022\nIncur liens;\n\u2022\nEnter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nConsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility or under our indenture governing our senior notes, could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our revolving credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders of holders or our senior notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nLimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nUnable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nUnable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, our significant indebtedness and our credit ratings could materially adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nIncreased borrowing costs will negatively impact our results of operations. Because most of our consumer credit programs have interest rates equal to the highest rate allowable under applicable state law, we would generally not be able to pass higher borrowing costs along to future consumer credit contracts and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. The interest rates on our revolving credit facility are variable based upon the LIBOR rate. The level of interest rates in the market in general will impact the interest rate on any debt instruments issued, if any. Additionally, we may issue debt securities or enter into credit facilities under which we pay interest at a higher rate than we have historically paid which would further reduce our margins and negatively impact our results of operations.\nDeterioration in the performance of our customer receivables portfolio could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and profitability. Our liquidity position and profitability are heavily dependent on our ability to collect our customer receivables. If our customer receivables portfolio were to substantially deteriorate, the liquidity available to us would most likely be reduced due to the challenges of complying with the covenants and borrowing base calculations under our revolving credit facility and our earnings may decline due to higher provisions for bad debt expense, higher servicing costs, higher net charge-off rates and lower interest and fee income.\nOur ability to collect from credit customers may be impaired by store closings and our need to rely on a replacement servicer in the event of our liquidation. We may be unable to collect a large portion of periodic credit payments should our stores close as many of our customers remit payments in-store. In the event of store closings, credit customers may not pay balances in a timely fashion, or may not pay at all, since a large number of our customers have not traditionally made payments to a central location.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit to customers, we rely on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished to us by or on behalf of our credit customers. If we and our systems are unable to detect any misrepresentations in this information, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In deciding whether to extend credit to customers, we rely heavily on information furnished to us by or on behalf of our credit customers and our ability to validate such information through third-party services, including employment and personal financial information. If a significant percentage of our credit customers intentionally or negligently misrepresent any of this information, and our systems do not detect such misrepresentations, it could impair our ability to effectively manage our credit risk, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur policy of re-aging certain delinquent borrowers affects our delinquency statistics and the timing and amount of our write-offs. Re-aging is offered to certain eligible past-due customers if they meet the conditions of our re-age policy. Our decision to offer a delinquent customer a re-age program is based on that borrower\u2019s specific condition, our history with the borrower, the amount of the loan and various other factors. When we re-age a customer\u2019s account, we move the account from a delinquent status to a current status. Management exercises a considerable amount of discretion over the re-aging process and has the ability to re-age an account multiple times during its life. Under our current policy, the maximum number of months an account can be re-aged over the life of the account is limited to 12 months. Treating an otherwise uncollectible account as current affects our delinquency statistics, as well as impacting the timing and amount of charge-offs. If these accounts had been charged off sooner, our net loss rates for earlier periods might have been higher.\nIf we fail to timely contact delinquent borrowers, the number of delinquent customer receivables eventually being charged off could increase. We contact customers with delinquent credit account balances soon after the account becomes delinquent. During periods of increased delinquencies it is important that we are proactive in dealing with customers rather than simply allowing customer receivables to go to charge-off. Historically, when our servicing becomes involved at an earlier stage of delinquency with credit counseling and workout programs, there is a greater likelihood that the customer receivable will not be charged off.\nThe success of our collection efforts depends on being properly staffed and trained to assist borrowers in bringing the delinquent balance current and ultimately avoiding charge-off. If we do not properly staff and train our collections personnel, or if we incur any downtime or other issues with our information systems that assist us with our collection efforts, then the number of accounts in a delinquent status or charged-off could increase. In addition, managing a substantially higher volume of delinquent customer receivables typically increases our operational costs. A rise in delinquencies or charge-offs could result in our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations to be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on internal models to manage risk and to provide accounting estimates. Our results could be materially adversely affected if those models do not provide reliable accounting estimates or predictions of future activity. We make significant use of business and financial models in connection with our efforts to measure and monitor our risk exposures and to manage our credit portfolio. For example, we use models as a basis for credit underwriting decisions, portfolio delinquency, charge-off and collection expectations and other market risks, based on economic factors and our experience. The information provided by these models is used in making business decisions relating to strategies, initiatives, transactions and pricing, as well as the size of our allowance for doubtful accounts, among other accounting estimates.\nModels are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on current and historical data available to us and our assumptions about factors such as credit demand, payment rates, default rates, delinquency rates and other factors that may overstate or understate future experience. Our models could produce unreliable results for a number of reasons, including the limitations of historical data to predict results due to unprecedented events or circumstances, invalid or incorrect assumptions underlying the models, the need for manual adjustments in response to rapid changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies, incorrect coding of the models, incorrect data being used by the models or inappropriate application of a model to products\nor events outside of the model\u2019s intended use. In particular, models are less dependable when the economic environment is outside of historical experience.\nIn addition, we continually receive new economic data. Our critical accounting estimates, such as the size of our allowance for doubtful accounts, are subject to change, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of changes in economic conditions. However, there is generally a lag between the availability of this economic information and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. When economic conditions change quickly and in unforeseen ways, there is a risk that the assumptions and inputs reflected in our models are not representative of current economic conditions. We may deem it necessary to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in the future. If our actual charge-offs exceed the assumption used to establish the allowance, our provision for losses would increase. Increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts would result in a decline in future revenues and earnings materially adversely affecting our results of operations and our financial position.\nChanges in the economy, credit policies and practices, and the credit and capital markets have required frequent adjustments to our models and the application of greater management judgment in the interpretation and adjustment of the results produced by our models. The application of greater management judgment reflects the need to take into account updated information while continuing to maintain controlled processes for model updates, including model development, testing, independent validation and implementation. As a result of the time and resources, including technical and staffing resources, that are required to perform these processes effectively, it may not be possible to replace existing models quickly enough to ensure that they will always properly account for the impacts of recent information and actions.\nAn economic downturn or other events may affect consumer purchases from us as well as their ability to repay their credit obligations to us, which could result in our net sales, gross margins and credit portfolio performance to be materially adversely affected. Many factors affect spending, including regional or world events, war, conditions in financial markets, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, energy and gasoline prices, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Our customers\u2019 purchases of our products decline during periods when disposable income is lower or periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. Recent turmoil in the national economy, including instability in financial markets, turmoil in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and decreases in consumer confidence and volatile oil prices have negatively impacted our markets and may present significant challenges to our operations in the future. If this occurs, our net sales and results of operations could decline.\nWe face significant competition from national, regional, local and internet retailers of furniture and mattresses, home appliances, and consumer electronics. The retail market for consumer electronics, furniture and mattresses is highly fragmented and intensely competitive and the market for home appliances is concentrated among a few major dealers. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national mass merchants, specialized national retailers, home improvement stores, and locally-owned regional or independent retail specialty stores that sell furniture and mattresses, home appliances, consumer and electronics, similar, and often identical, to those items we sell. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Additionally, we compete to some extent against companies offering products to credit constrained consumers similar to those offered by us for the home under weekly or monthly rent-to-own payment options.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors. Some of our competitors have financial resources that may be substantially greater than ours and they may be able to purchase inventory at lower costs and better endure economic downturns. As a result, our sales may decline if we cannot offer competitive prices to our customers or we may be required to accept lower profit margins. Our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and may have greater resources to devote to promotion and sale of products and services. If two or more competitors consolidate their businesses or enter into strategic partnerships, they may be able to compete more effectively against us.\nOur existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including:\n\u2022\nExpansion by our existing competitors or entry by new competitors into markets where we currently operate;\n\u2022\nLower pricing;\n\u2022\nAggressive advertising and marketing;\n\u2022\nExtension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer;\n\u2022\nLarger store size, which may result in greater operational efficiencies, or innovative store formats; and\n\u2022\nAdoption of improved retail sales methods.\nCompetition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, sales and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in customer demand and product mix could materially adversely affect our business. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our ability to maintain and increase sales depends to a large extent on the introduction and availability of new products and technologies and our ability to respond timely to customer demands and preferences for such new products. It is possible that the introduction of new products will never achieve widespread consumer acceptance or will be supplanted by alternative products and technologies that do not offer us a similar sales opportunity or are sold at lower price points or margins. We might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns which could result in our sales and operating performance to be materially adversely affected. In addition, we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors several months in advance of proposed delivery dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell could affect our inventory strategies which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory.\nFurthermore, due to our increasing emphasis on furniture and mattress offerings we are building larger new stores and investing additional capital to expand existing stores to accommodate those offerings. If we are unable to execute on our furniture and mattress offering strategy, we could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant price pressures over the life cycle of our products from competing technologies and our competitors. Prices for many of our products decrease over their life cycle. Such decreases often result in decreased gross profit margins. Suppliers may also seek to reduce our margins on the sales of their products in order to increase their own profitability. The consumer electronics industry depends on new products to drive increases in sales. Typically, these new products, such as high-definition flat-panel (including 3-D, LCD, LED and internet-ready technology) televisions, Blu-ray players and digital cameras are introduced at relatively high price points that are then gradually reduced as the product becomes mainstream. To sustain same store sales growth, unit sales must increase at a rate greater than the decline in product prices. The affordability of the product helps drive the unit sales growth. However, as a result of relatively short product life cycles in the consumer electronics industry, which limit the amount of time available for sales volume to increase, combined with rapid price erosion in the industry, retailers are challenged to maintain overall gross margin levels and positive same store sales. We continue to adjust our marketing strategies to address this challenge through the introduction of new product categories and new products within our existing categories. If we fail to accurately anticipate the introduction of new technologies, we may possess significant amounts of obsolete inventory that can only be sold at substantially lower prices than we anticipated. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our historical margin levels in the future due to increased sales of lower margin products such as personal electronics products and declines in average selling prices of key products. If sales of lower margin items continue to increase and replace sales of higher margin items or our consumer electronics products average selling prices decreases due to the maturity of their life cycle, our gross margin and overall gross profit levels may be materially adversely affected.\nA disruption in our relationships with, in the operations of, or the supply of product from any of our key suppliers could cause our sales to decline. The success of our business and growth strategies depends to a significant degree on our relationships with our suppliers, particularly our brand name suppliers. We do not have long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with the majority of our vendors. We typically order our inventory through the issuance of individual purchase orders to vendors. We have no contractual assurance of the continued supply of merchandise we currently, or would like to, offer our customers. We also rely on our suppliers for funds in the form of vendor allowances. We may be subject to rationing by suppliers with respect to a number of limited distribution items. In addition we rely heavily on a relatively small number of suppliers. The loss of any one or more of our key suppliers or failure to establish and maintain relationships with these and other vendors, and limitations on the availability of inventory or repair parts, could have a materially adverse effect on our supply and assortment of products, as we may not be able to find suitable replacements to supply products at competitive prices, and on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf one of our vendors were to go out of business, it could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition if such vendor is unable to fund amounts due to us, including payments due for returns of product and warranty claims. Catastrophic or other unforeseen events, such as the one which impacted Japan during 2011, could materially adversely impact the supply and delivery to us of products manufactured outside the United States and could materially adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, because many of the products we sell are manufactured outside of the United States, we may experience labor unrest or an increase in the cost of imported vendor products at any time for reasons beyond our control. For example, the current port disruption in Long Beach, California, or similar disruption or strike at any other port from which we receive our imported merchandise, could significantly disrupt and create significant risks for our business. Any slow-downs, disruptions or strikes at any of these ports may have a materially adverse effect on our relationships with our customers and our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers and reduced revenues and earnings. If imported merchandise\nbecomes more expensive, unavailable or difficult to obtain, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers. Products from alternative sources may also be more expensive than those our vendors currently import.\nOur ability to enter new markets successfully depends, to a significant extent, on the willingness and ability of our vendors to supply merchandise to additional distribution centers and stores. If vendors are unwilling or unable to supply some or all of their products to us at acceptable prices in one or more markets, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, we rely on credit from vendors to purchase our products. A substantial change in credit terms from vendors or vendors\u2019 willingness to extend credit to us, including providing inventory under consignment arrangements, would reduce our ability to obtain the merchandise that we sell, which could have a materially adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. In addition, if our vendors fail to continue to offer vendor allowances, or we are restricted in our ability to earn such funds, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nTurmoil in financial markets and economic disruptions in other parts of the world may also negatively impact our suppliers\u2019 access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventory, production levels, product quality, and to operate their businesses, all of which could materially adversely affect our supply chain. It may also cause them to change their pricing policies, which could impact demand for their products. Economic disruptions and market instability may make it difficult for us and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to carry too much or too little merchandise in various product categories. In addition, to the extent that any manufacturer utilizes labor practices that are not commonly accepted in the United States, we could be materially adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity.\nYou should not rely on our changes in same store sales as an indication of our future results of operations because they fluctuate significantly. Our historical changes in same store sales have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our same store sales results, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in competition, such as pricing pressure, and the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nNew product introductions;\n\u2022\nChanges in our marketing programs;\n\u2022\nConsumer trends;\n\u2022\nChanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\nChanges in the relative sales price points of our major product categories;\n\u2022\nUnderwriting standards for our customers purchasing merchandise on credit;\n\u2022\nAbility to offer credit programs attractive to our customers;\n\u2022\nThe impact of any new stores on our existing stores;\n\u2022\nWeather conditions in our markets;\n\u2022\nTiming of promotional events;\n\u2022\nTiming, location and participants of major sporting events;\n\u2022\nThe number of new store openings;\n\u2022\nThe percentage of our stores that are mature stores;\n\u2022\nThe locations of our stores and the traffic drawn to those areas;\n\u2022\nHow often we update our stores; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to execute our business strategy effectively.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by changes in consumer protection laws and regulations. Federal and state consumer protection laws, regulations and agencies, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") heavily regulate the way we conduct business and could limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit and collect on our accounts. Because our customers finance through our credit segment a substantial portion of our sales, any change in the regulation of consumer credit could result in our sales and gross margins to be materially adversely affected.\nNew laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees that may be charged on consumer credit accounts, including by reducing the maximum interest rate that can be charged in the states in which we operate, or impose limitations on our ability to collect on account balances, which could have a materially adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations. Compliance with existing and future laws or regulations, including regulations that may be applicable to us under the Dodd-Frank Act, could\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in negative publicity, fines or additional licensing expenses, any of which could result in our cash flow and results of operations to be materially adversely affected.\nWe have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance with the numerous federal and state laws and regulations and believe we are in compliance with such laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are complex, differ between jurisdictions and are often subject to interpretation. As we expand into additional jurisdictions, the complexities grow. Compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and requires the time and attention of management. These costs divert capital and focus away from efforts intended to grow our business. If we do not successfully comply with laws, regulations, or policies, we could incur fines or penalties, lose existing or new customers, or suffer damage to our reputation. Changes in these laws and regulations can significantly alter our business environment, limit business operations, and increase costs of doing business, and we may not be able predict the impact such changes would have on our profitability.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a new agency and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the agency's actions will impact our business. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, and established the CFPB. It has authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, and enforce those laws. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices through its supervisory enforcement and regulatory authority. It is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. In addition, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to the products we offer. The system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory, enforcement, or examination focus. There continues to be uncertainty as to how, or if, the CFPB and its strategies and priorities will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward and could result in new regulatory requirements and regulatory costs for us.\nIn November 2013, the CFPB issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking guidance from the public on a wide array of issues relating to debt collection, including debt buying and third-party collectors. From time to time, we have sold, and may continue to sell, charged-off accounts to third-parties to attempt to minimize the losses incurred on those accounts. We also from time to time engage, or may engage, persons who may be deemed to be debt collectors, to collect accounts on our behalf. Although we have committed resources to enhancing our compliance programs, changes in regulatory expectations, interpretations or practices could increase the risk of enforcement actions, fines and penalties. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter our products and services that would make our products less attractive to consumers and impair our ability to offer them profitably. Future actions by regulators that discourage the use of products we offer or steer consumers to other products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of customers. Should the CFPB change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or modify past regulatory guidance, our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase. Our litigation exposure could also increase if the CFPB exercises its authority to limit or ban pre-dispute arbitration clauses. This additional focus and regulatory oversight could significantly increase operating costs.\nWe are required to comply with laws and regulations regulating credit extensions and other dealings with customers and our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or any adverse change in those laws or regulations, could have a negative impact on our business. Our customers finance through our credit segment a substantial portion of our sales. Providing credit and other financial products and otherwise dealing with consumers and information provided by consumers does or could subject us to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local government authorities, including the CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission, the SEC, state regulators having jurisdiction over persons engaged in consumer sales, consumer credit and other financial products and consumer debt collection, and state attorney generals. Our business practices, including the terms of our marketing and advertising, our procedures and practices for credit applications and underwriting, the terms of our credit extensions and related disclosures, our data privacy and protection practices, and our collection practices, may be subject to periodic or special reviews by these regulatory and enforcement authorities. These reviews could range from investigations of specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries into our practices generally. If as part of these reviews the regulatory authorities conclude that we are not complying with applicable law or regulations, they could request or impose a wide range of sanctions and remedies including requiring changes in advertising and collection practices, changes in our credit application and underwriting practices, changes in our data privacy or protection practices, changes in the terms of our credit or other financial products (such as decreases in interest rates or fees), the imposition of fines or penalties, or the paying of restitution or the taking of other remedial action with respect to affected customers. They also could require us to stop offering some of our credit or other financial products within one or more states, or nationwide.\nNegative publicity relating to any specific inquiry or investigation, regardless of whether we have violated any applicable law or regulation or the extent of any such violation, could negatively affect our reputation and our brand as well as our stock price, which would materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and would raise our costs of doing business.\nIf any deficiencies or violations of law or regulations are identified by us or asserted by any regulator or other person, or if any regulatory or enforcement authority or court requires us to change any of our practices, the correction of such deficiencies or violations, or the making of such changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business. We face the risk that restrictions or limitations resulting from the enactment, change, or interpretation of federal or state laws and regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, could negatively affect our business activities, require us to make significant expenditures or effectively eliminate credit products or other financial products currently offered to customers.\nAny failure on our part to comply with legal requirements in connection with credit or other financial products, or in connection with servicing our accounts or collecting debts or otherwise dealing with consumers, could significantly impair our ability to collect the full amount of the account balances and could subject us to substantial liability for damages or penalties. The institution of any litigation of this nature, or the rendering of any judgment, against us or any other industry participant in any litigation of this nature, could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may also expand into additional jurisdictions. We must comply with the laws of each state we operate in, which are not uniform. The difference of the laws from the jurisdictions where we currently operate, or even changes to the laws in those jurisdictions, could negatively impact our operations.\nWe have been named as a defendant in multiple securities class action lawsuits, shareholder derivative lawsuits, and we have also received a non-public voluntary request for information from the SEC. Potential similar or related litigation or inquiries could result in substantial damages and may divert management's time and attention from our business. We and certain of our current and former officers and directors are named as defendants in securities class action lawsuits and in related shareholder derivative lawsuits. We have also received a non-public, voluntary request for information from the SEC. Each of these matters is described in more detail in Part II, Item 8, under the heading \"Litigation\" in Note 15. Contingencies, of the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are, or in the future may become, a party will be resolved in our favor. These lawsuits and any other lawsuits that we may become party to are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the costs incurred relating to defending litigation matters will depend upon many unknown factors. Any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages, including punitive damages, and other related fees or prevent us from selling certain of our products. Regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation, any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve.\nFurthermore, we are unable to predict the timing or outcome of the SEC inquiry or estimate the nature or amount of any possible sanction or enforcement action the SEC could seek to impose, which could include fines, penalties, damages, sanctions, administrative remedies and modifications to our disclosure, accounting and business practices, including a prohibition on specific conduct or a potential restatement of our financial statements, any of which could be material.\nThe lawsuits and SEC inquiry, along with any reputation issues raised by the lawsuits or inquiry, could result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business and also harm our relationships with existing customers and vendors. Our legal expenses incurred in defending the lawsuits and responding to the SEC inquiry could be significant, and a ruling against us, or a settlement of any of these matters could materially adversely affect our cash flow, financial results and stock price.\nPending litigation relating to the sale of credit insurance and the sale of repair service agreements in the retail industry could materially adversely affect our business. State attorney generals and private plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against other retailers relating to improper practices conducted in connection with the sale of credit insurance in several jurisdictions around the country. We offer credit insurance in our stores on sales financed under our credit programs and require customers to purchase property insurance from us, or provide evidence from a third-party insurance provider, at their election, in connection with sales of merchandise on installment credit; therefore, similar litigation could be brought against us. While we believe we are in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations, if we are found liable in any future lawsuit regarding credit insurance or repair service agreements, we could be required to pay substantial damages or incur substantial costs as part of an out-of-court settlement or require us to modify or suspend certain operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. An adverse judgment or any negative publicity associated with our repair service agreements or any potential credit insurance litigation could also affect our reputation, which could have a negative impact on our cash flow and results of operations.\nPending and potential litigation regarding alleged patent infringements could result in significant costs to us to defend what we consider to be spurious claims. Recently the manufacturing, retail and software industries have been the targets of patent litigation claimants making demands or filing claims based upon alleged patent infringement through the manufacturing and selling, either in merchandise or through software and internet websites, of product or merely providing access through website\nportals. We, in conjunction with multiple other parties, have been and are the targets of such claims. While we believe that we have not violated or infringed any third-party alleged patent rights, and intend to defend vigorously any such claims, the cost to defend, settle or pay any such claims could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.\nOur governance documents and state law provide certain anti-takeover measures which could prevent or delay a change in control of the Company, even if such changes would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nNo stockholder action may be taken without a meeting, unless such action has been approved in advance by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nStockholders cannot call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nAdvance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nAuthorization of the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.\nOn October 6, 2014, we also adopted a one-year stockholders\u2019 rights plan, the purpose of which is, among other things, to enhance our Board of Director's ability to protect stockholder interests against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer a fair price to our stockholders. The stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or could discourage a third-party from acquiring, the Company or a large block of the Company's common stock. The effect of these rights may impact the price that investors are willing to pay for securities.\nFurther, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits certain transactions and business combinations between a corporation and a stockholder owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from the date the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder. These provisions and our stockholders\u2019 rights plan, either alone or in combination with each other, could delay, deter or prevent a change of control, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders.\nOur corporate actions may be substantially controlled by our principal stockholders and affiliated entities. Luxor Capital Group, L.P, Stephens Inc., The Stephens Group, LLC, Anchorage Capital Group, LLC, Greenlight Capital, Inc., Morgan Stanley, Citadel Advisors LLC, and Susquehanna Securities (together with each of their respective affiliates), each own more than 5% or more of our outstanding shares common stock, and beneficially own, in the aggregate, a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock. The concentration of ownership of our shares of common stock by the relatively small number of hedge funds and investors may:\n\u2022\nHave significant influence in determining the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations, and the sale of all or substantially of our assets or other significant corporate actions;\n\u2022\nDelay or deter a change of control of the Company;\n\u2022\nDeprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of the Company; and\n\u2022\nAffect the market price volatility and liquidity of our shares of common stock.\nThe interests of these investors and their respective affiliates may differ from or be adverse to the interests of our other stockholders. If any of these investors sells a substantial number of shares in the public market, the market price of our shares could fall. The perception among the public that these sales will occur could also contribute to a decline in the market price of the shares.\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations. Changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our cost of doing business. In addition, changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our cost of doing business. Also, passage of the Employer Free Choice Act or similar laws in Congress could lead to higher labor costs by encouraging unionization efforts among our associates and disruption of store operations.\nOur stores are concentrated in certain regions of the United States, which subjects us to regional risks, such as the economy, weather conditions, hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. If the region suffers a continued or another economic downturn or any other adverse regional event, such as inclement weather, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations. Several of our competitors operate stores across the United States and thus may not be as vulnerable to the risks of operating in a concentrated region. The states and the local economies where many of our stores are located are dependent, to a degree, on the oil and gas industries, which can be very volatile. Because of fears of climate change and adverse effects of drilling explosions and oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, legislation has been considered, and governmental regulations and orders have been issued, which, combined with the local economic and employment conditions caused by both, could materially adversely impact the oil and gas industries and the areas in which a significant number of our stores are located. To the extent the oil and gas industries are negatively impacted by changes in commodity prices, climate change or other legislation and other factors, we could be negatively impacted by reduced employment, or other negative economic factors that impact the local economies where we have our stores.\nOur information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business. Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our credit operations and inventory levels, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at the store level, communicate customer information, aggregate daily sales information and manage our credit portfolio, including processing of credit applications and management of collections. These systems and our operations are subject to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\nPower loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;\n\u2022\nOperator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;\n\u2022\nPhysical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events;\n\u2022\nComputer viruses;\n\u2022\nIntentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and\n\u2022\nHurricanes, fires, floods and other natural disasters.\nIn addition, the software that we have developed internally to use in our daily operations may contain undetected errors that could cause our network to fail or our expenses to increase. Any failure of our systems due to any of these causes, if it is not supported by our disaster recovery plan, could cause an interruption in our operations and result in reduced net sales and results of operations. Though we have implemented contingency and disaster recovery processes in the event of one or several technology failures, any unforeseen failure, interruption or compromise of our systems or our security measures could affect our flow of business and, if prolonged, could harm our reputation. The risk of possible failures or interruptions may not be adequately addressed by us or the third-parties on which we rely, and such failures or interruptions could occur. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur management information systems may not be adequate to meet our evolving business and emerging regulatory needs and the failure to successfully implement new systems could negatively impact the business and our financial results. We are investing significant capital in new information technology systems and implementing modifications and upgrades to existing systems to support our growth plan. These investments include replacing legacy systems, making changes to existing systems, building redundancies, and acquiring new systems and hardware with updated functionality. We are taking appropriate actions to ensure the successful implementation of these initiatives, including the testing of new systems and the transfer of existing data, with minimal disruptions to the business. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, may cause disruptions to our existing systems and our business, and may not provide the anticipated benefits. The disruption in our information technology systems, or our inability to improve, upgrade, integrate or expand our systems to meet our evolving business and emerging regulatory requirements, could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could materially adversely impact our sales, collections efforts, cash flows and financial condition.\nChanges in premium and commission rates on the insurance products we sell or our inability to maintain our insurance licenses requirements in the states we operate could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income from the commissions we earn from the sale of various insurance products of third-party insurers to our customers. These products include credit insurance, repair service agreements and product replacement policies. We also are the direct obligor on certain extended repair service agreements we offer to our customers. If for any reason we were unable to maintain our insurance licenses in the states we operate or if there are material claims or future material litigation involving our repair service agreements or product replacement policies, our results of operations would suffer. If the commission we retain from sales of those products declines, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to continue to offer third-party repair service agreements to our customers, we could incur additional costs or repair expenses, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are a limited number of insurance carriers that provide repair service agreement programs. If insurance becomes unavailable from our current providers for any reason, we may be unable to provide repair service agreements to our customers on the same terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a substitute provider, higher premiums may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability if we are unable to pass along the increased cost of such coverage to our customers. Inability to maintain the repair service agreement program could cause fluctuations in our repair expenses and greater volatility of earnings and could require us to become the obligor under new contracts sold.\nIf we are unable to maintain group credit insurance policies from insurance carriers, which allow us to offer their credit insurance products to our customers purchasing our merchandise on credit, our revenues would be reduced and the provision for bad debts might increase. There are a limited number of insurance carriers that provide credit insurance coverage for sale to our customers. If credit insurance becomes unavailable for any reason we may be unable to offer substitute coverage on the same terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain substitute coverage, it may be at higher rates or reduced coverage, which could affect the customer acceptance of these products, reduce our revenues or increase our credit losses.\nChanges in trade regulations, currency exchange rate fluctuations and other factors beyond our control could affect our business. A significant portion of our inventory is manufactured and/or assembled overseas and in Mexico. Changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuations or other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages of these items, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Conversely, significant reductions in the cost of these items in U.S. dollars may cause a significant reduction in the retail prices of those products, resulting in a material adverse effect on our sales, margins or competitive position. In addition, commissions earned on our credit insurance, repair service agreement or product replacement agreement products could be materially adversely affected by changes in statutory premium rates, commission rates, adverse claims experience and other factors.\nOur costs to protect our intellectual property rights, infringement of which could impair our name and reputation, could be significant. We believe that our success and ability to compete depends in part on consumer identification of the name \"Conn\u2019s\" and rely on certain trademark registrations and common law rights to protect the distinctiveness of our brand. We intend to protect vigorously our trademarks against infringement, misappropriation or dilution by others. A third-party, however, could attempt to misappropriate our intellectual property or claim that our intellectual property infringes or otherwise violates third-party trademarks in the future. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, or whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to protect the security of our customer\u2019s information or failure to comply with data privacy and protection laws could expose us to litigation, compromise the integrity of our products, damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial results. Our business regularly captures, collects, handles, processes, transmits and stores significant amounts of sensitive information about our customers, employees and others, sensitive information, including financial records, credit and business information, and certain other personally identifiable or other sensitive personal information. A number of retailers have experienced actual security breaches, including a number of highly publicized incidents with well-known retailers. To our knowledge, we have not had what we believe to be a significant security breach. In addition, we rely on the secure operation of our website, the internet and other third-party systems generally to assist us in the collection and transmission of this data. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card information breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error and/or malfeasance. A compromise of our information security controls or of those businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations. Moreover, a data security breach could require that we expend significant resources related to our information systems and infrastructure, and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. In addition, compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\nWe maintain data breach and network security liability insurance; however, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for any liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms,\nor at all. We may need to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, diverting resources from the growth and expansion of our business.\nAny changes in the tax laws of the states in which we operate could affect our state tax liabilities. Additionally, beginning operations in new states could also affect our state tax liabilities. Legislation could be introduced at any time that changes our state tax liabilities in a way that has a material adverse impact on our results of operations. The Texas margin tax, which is based on gross profit rather than earnings, can create significant volatility in our effective tax rate. Our entry into new states in the future could subject us to additional tax rate volatility, dependent upon the tax laws in place in those states, which could materially adversely effect our results of operations.\nSignificant volatility in oil and gasoline prices could affect our customers\u2019 determination to drive to our store and our third-party delivery service. Significant volatility in oil and gasoline prices could materially adversely affect our customers\u2019 shopping decisions and patterns. We rely heavily on our distribution system and our next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers\u2019 needs and desires, and increases in oil and gasoline prices could result in increased distribution costs and delivery charges. If we are unable to effectively pass increased transportation costs on to the consumer, either by increased delivery costs or higher prices, such costs have materially affect our results of operations. Such increases may not significantly affect our competitors.\nFailure to successfully utilize and manage e-commerce could materially adversely affect our business and prospects. Our website provides new and existing customers with the ability to review our product offerings and prices, apply for credit, and access and make payments on their credit accounts. Customers may also purchase products on our website using a credit card. Our website is a significant component of our advertising strategy. We believe our website represents a possible source for future sales and growth in our credit collections. In order to promote our products and services, allow our customers to complete credit applications in the privacy of their homes and on their mobile devices, make payments on their account and drive traffic to our stores, we must effectively create, design, publish and distribute content over the internet. There can be no assurance that we will be able to design and publish web content with a high level of effectiveness or grow our e-commerce business in a profitable manner.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity, our business could be materially adversely impacted. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as paper instrument counterfeiting, fraudulent payment or refund schemes and identity theft. As we make more of our services available over the internet and other media, and as we expand into new geographies without an established customer base, we subject ourselves to consumer fraud risk. Certain former retail agents have also engaged in fraud against consumers or us, and existing agents could engage in fraud against consumers or us. While we believe past incidents of fraudulent activity have been relatively isolated, we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. We use a variety of tools to protect against fraud; however, these tools may not always be successful. Allegations of fraud may result in increased costs, including possible settlement and litigation expenses, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs. We lease most of our store locations, our corporate headquarters and our distribution centers. Our continued growth and success depends in part on our ability to locate property for new stores and renew leases for existing locations. There is no assurance that we will be able to locate real estate for new store, or renegotiate leases for existing locations at similar or favorable terms at the end of the lease and we could be forced to move or exit a market if another favorable arrangement cannot be made. Furthermore, a significant rise in real estate prices or real property taxes could result in an increase in store lease expense as we open new locations and renew leases for existing locations, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. Our inability to renew, extend or replace expiring store leases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, which could materially adversely affect our business. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be nonetheless committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under that lease. Our inability to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nFailure to maintain positive brand perception and recognition could have a negative impact on our business. Maintaining a good reputation is critical to the business. The considerable expansion of technological outreach, including through the use of social media, has increased the risk that our reputation could be negatively impacted in a short amount of time. If we are unable\nto quickly and effectively respond to such incidents, we may suffer declines in customer loyalty and traffic, vendor relationship issues, and other factors, all of which could negatively impact our financial results and reputation.\nIf our third-party delivery services are unable to meet our promised delivery schedule, our net sales may decline due to a decline in customer satisfaction. We offer next day delivery to our customers that we outsource to third-party delivery services. These third-parties are subject to risks that are beyond our control and, if they fail to timely deliver our products, we may lose business from these customers in the future and it could damage our reputation. The loss of customers and/or damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nOur failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls could result in inaccurate reporting of financial results and harm our business. We are required to comply with a variety of reporting, accounting and other rules and regulations. As such, we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal control systems. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs. Furthermore, compliance with existing requirements is expensive and we may need to implement additional finance and accounting and other systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our reporting requirements. If our internal control over financial reporting is determined to be ineffective, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affect the market price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, and materially adversely impact our business and financial condition\nStock market volatility may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The Company\u2019s common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be subject to significant volatility. A variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, including:\n\u2022\nGeneral market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock;\n\u2022\nState or federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are, or are perceived to be, adverse to our operations;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of developments related to our business or our competitors;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in our operating results and the provision for bad debts;\n\u2022\nGeneral conditions in the consumer financial service industry, the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets;\n\u2022\nChanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nOur failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nNegative commentary regarding us and corresponding short-selling market behavior;\n\u2022\nAdverse developments in our relationships with our customers;\n\u2022\nLegal proceedings brought against the Company or its officers and directors; and\n\u2022\nSignificant changes in our senior management team.\nDue to the volatility of our stock price, we are and may be in the future the target of securities litigation. Such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nWe face risks with respect to product liability claims and product recalls, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, our business, and our consolidated results of operations. We purchase merchandise from third-parties and offer this merchandise to customers for sale. This merchandise could be subject to recalls and other actions by regulatory authorities. Changes in laws and regulations could also impact the type of merchandise we offer to customers. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues that result in recalls of merchandise. In addition, individuals may in the future assert claims, that they have sustained injuries from third-party merchandise offered by us, and we may be subject to future lawsuits relating to these claims. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Any of the issues mentioned above could result in damage to our reputation, diversion of development and management resources, or reduced sales and increased costs, any of which could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 89908, "SIC": 5731, "TIC": "CONN"}
