{"cik": "815093", "company": "MGC DIAGNOSTICS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur results are affected by changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions.\nWe derived 20.0% and 19.5% of our revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, from outside the United States. Our business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond our control, such as downturns in economic activity or labor conditions in a specific country or region.\nOur ownership and operation of MediSoft entails ownership of Euro-denominated assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, which currency may fluctuate widely in relation to the US Dollar.\nDuring the three months ended October 31, 2014, we incurred $455,000 of foreign currency losses reported as part of our consolidated net loss and $114,000 in foreign currency transaction losses which are recorded within other comprehensive loss. Our business may be adversely affected by Euro and other currency rate fluctuations against the US Dollar.\nOur success depends on our ability to sell our Medical Graphics and MediSoft cardiorespiratory products into our core hospital, clinic and physician office markets.\nWe sell our Medical Graphics and MediSoft cardiorespiratory diagnostic products and services to hospitals, clinics and physician offices. As a result of the disruptive and uncertain economic conditions that emerged in recent years and the related cost-containment measures initiated by many of our customers, we believe that a challenging environment for the sale of our products may continue in fiscal 2015.\nOur association with domestic Group Purchasing Organizations may result in reduced gross margins.\nPrice competition or negotiated lower prices with GPOs may exert downward pressure on prices we are able to charge for our products. We cannot ensure that we will be able to offset any downward price pressure through corresponding cost reductions. Any failure to offset this pressure could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nHealthcare policy changes, including national legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on all U.S. medical device sales beginning in calendar 2013. Our profitability has been negatively affected due to the imposition of this tax. In addition, there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or the consequences not fully understood. These provisions may affect aspects of our business.\nIf we are unable to regain and sustain profitability in 2015 and beyond, our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we were profitable in fiscal 2013, we were unprofitable in fiscal 2008 through 2012 and in fiscal 2014 and had an accumulated deficit of $8.3 million as of October 31, 2014. While we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance of $5.7 million as of October 31, 2014 will be adequate to support operations for the next fiscal year or more, we must ultimately regain sustained profitability or obtain additional financing to be able to meet our future cash flow requirements, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve either of these.\nIf we are unable to attain synergies expected to result from the acquisition of MediSoft, our sustained profitability may be uncertain.\nWe have made significant personnel and financial resource commitments for the acquisition and assimilation of MediSoft. If we are unable to integrate MediSoft operations to produce planned growth and expected synergies while we develop and upgrade operating and control processes, our combined profitability and financial position may be adversely affected.\nThe financial soundness of our vendors could affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on third party vendors for certain components used in our products. We purchase a number of significant components, such as capacitors, batteries and integrated circuits, from sole source suppliers. Although we attempt to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory of these components to minimize production delays or interruptions, we cannot ensure that we will find suitable alternatives at reasonable prices, if at all, or that any alternatives will remain available to us. Our inability to obtain acceptable components in a timely manner or find and maintain suitable replacement suppliers for components would have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to manufacture our products. As a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of the world in recent years, our vendors may have experienced and continue to experience cash flow concerns. As a result, vendors may increase their prices, reduce their output or change terms of sales. Any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.\nTechnology in the medical device industry changes rapidly.\nRapid technological change, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions are all characteristics of the medical device industry. We face intense competition from other device manufacturers that may have access to greater resources. Our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing products before we do. Any of these developments could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur future operations are dependent upon variables outside our control.\nSuccessful implementation of our business plan depends on the interaction of many variables, including the effects of changing industry conditions and new competition. While we believe that our business plan reflects reasonable judgments in assessing those risks, we cannot ensure that unforeseen influences will not adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan strategies. While we believe that our business plan projections are in line with achievable performance levels, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain, and sustain, projected sales revenue.\nProtection of intellectual property is critical to our business.\nPatents and trademarks are critical in the medical device industry. We believe strongly in protecting our intellectual property and have a long history of obtaining patents, when available, in connection with our research and product development programs. We own a number of United States and foreign patents. We also own registered trademarks, and have applied for other trademarks in the United States and foreign countries. We cannot ensure that we will be granted patents and trademarks in the future, or that any patents and trademarks that we now hold or may be granted, or under which we have held license rights, will be valid or otherwise be of value to us. Even if our patents and trademarks are valid, others may be able to introduce non-infringing competitive products.\nAlthough patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing agreements or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial, and we cannot ensure that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property, including know-how, in part, through confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements and assignment of invention provisions in agreements with employees, consultants and other parties, as well as through contractual exclusivity with certain suppliers. We cannot ensure that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.\nWe are dependent upon our senior management and other key personnel.\nOur success depends largely on effective leadership from our senior management and other key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel with sufficient and relevant experience in the medical device industry is intense. Accordingly, the loss of the services of these individuals, or the inability to hire additional key individuals as required, could have a material adverse effect on us, including our current and future product development efforts. In fiscal 2012, we hired an executive vice president of global marketing, engineering and corporate strategy, who was recently promoted to Chief Executive Officer, and executive vice president of global sales, who was recently promoted to President. In fiscal 2013, we hired an executive vice president, finance and corporate development, who was recently promoted to Chief Operating Officer as well as Chief Financial Officer. To achieve future success, our senior management, including these new members of management, must make a successful transition into their new roles and ultimately develop and implement a strategic plan.\nOur ability to repurchase our common shares or pay cash dividends requires us to comply with our credit agreement.\nOn July 24, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) with BMO Harris Bank NA (\u201cBank\u201d). The credit facility currently includes a five-year $4.0 term loan and a $250,000 revolving credit facility. The Agreement includes other usual and customary covenants for facilities of this nature, and requires the Company to comply with the Agreement\u2019s financial covenants as a condition to repurchasing its shares or paying any dividends.\nIf the Company fails to comply with the covenant under its credit facility, the Bank could declare an event of default and accelerate the indebtedness under the credit facility.\nBecause of its loss in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, the Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants its credit facility as of October 31, 2014. On January 29, 2015, the Company and Bank entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, and established new financial and other covenants. If the Company fails to comply with the new covenants under this credit agreement, the Bank could declare a default under the credit agreement and pursue remedies, including acceleration of the indebtedness.\nAnti-Takeover provisions in Minnesota law may make a hostile takeover of our business more difficult.\nWe are governed by the provisions of Sections 302A.671 and 302A.673 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could potentially operate to deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock and may also have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock. Section 302A.671 generally provides that the shares of a corporation acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d have no voting rights unless voting rights are approved by the shareholders in a prescribed manner. A \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d is generally defined as an acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares that would, when added to all other shares beneficially owned by the acquiring person, entitle the acquiring person to have voting power of 20% or more in the election of directors. Section 302A.673 prohibits a public corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions. An \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d is a person who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Reference is made to the detailed terms of Sections 302A.671 and 302A.673 of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. We have also entered into agreements with certain executive officers that provide for certain benefits upon a change of control. These agreements would make any sale of the Company more expensive to a third party.", "PERMNO": 89609, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "MGCD"}
