{"cik": "60977", "company": "LYDALL INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe reader should carefully review and consider the risk factors discussed below. Any and all of these risk factors could materially affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, future results of operations or cash flows and possibly lead to a decline in Lydall\u2019s stock price. The risks, uncertainties and other factors described below constitute all material risk factors known to management as of the date of this report.\nGlobal political or economic changes may negatively impact Lydall\u2019s business - Ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and impact profitability. Among other factors, political conflicts or changes, disruptions in the global credit and financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, swings in consumer confidence and spending, unstable economic growth and fluctuations in unemployment rates causing economic instability could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These factors also make it difficult to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign and export sales were 44.2% of net sales in 2015, 46.2% in 2014, and 45.2% in 2013. If the global economy were to take a significant downturn, depending on the length, duration and severity of such downturn, the Company\u2019s business and financial statements could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s Thermal/Acoustical Metals and Thermal/Acoustical Fibers segments are tied primarily to general economic and automotive industry conditions - The Company\u2019s Thermal/Acoustical Metals and Thermal/Acoustical Fibers segments, both of which are suppliers in the automotive market, accounted for 57.1%, 54.7%, and 68.5% of consolidated net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The segments net sales from products manufactured in North America were 70.6%, 67.4%, and 65.4% in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, with the remainder manufactured in Europe and Asia. These segments are closely tied to general economic and automotive industry conditions as demand for vehicles depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit, the cost of fuel, legislative and regulatory oversight and trade agreements. These factors have had, and could continue to have, a substantial impact on these segments. Adverse developments could reduce demand for new vehicles, causing Lydall\u2019s customers to reduce their vehicle production in North America, Europe and Asia and, as a result, demand for Company products would be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results may fluctuate; as a result, the Company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause Lydall\u2019s stock price to decline - The Company\u2019s quarterly results are subject to significant fluctuations. Operating results have fluctuated as a result of many factors, including size and timing of orders and shipments, loss of significant customers, product mix, technological change, operational efficiencies and inefficiencies, competition, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, strategic initiatives, severance and recruiting charges, asset impairments and general economic conditions. In addition, lower revenues may cause asset utilization to decrease, resulting in the under absorption of the Company\u2019s fixed costs, which could negatively impact gross margins. Additionally, the Company\u2019s gross margins vary among its product groups and have fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of shifts in product mix. Any and all of these factors could affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, future results of operations or cash flows and possibly lead to a decline in Lydall\u2019s stock price.\nImplementation of the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives may not be successful - As part of Lydall\u2019s business strategy, the Company continues to review various strategic and business opportunities to grow the business and to assess the profitability and growth potential for each of its existing businesses. The Company may incur significant professional services expenses associated with the review and potential implementation of strategic business opportunities. The Company cannot predict with certainty whether any recent or future strategic transactions will be beneficial to the Company. Among other things, future performance could be impacted by the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nIdentify and effectively complete strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nObtain adequate financing to fund strategic initiatives, which could be difficult to obtain;\n\u2022\nSuccessfully integrate and manage acquired businesses that involve numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, diversion of management's attention from other\nbusiness concerns, managing assets in multiple geographic regions and potential loss of key employees and key customers of acquired operations;\n\u2022\nImprove operating margins through its Lean Six Sigma initiatives which are intended to improve processes and work flow, improve customer service, reduce costs and leverage synergies across the Company; and\n\u2022\nSuccessfully invest and deploy capital investments to support our business and commitments to our customers.\nIn order to meet its strategic objectives, the Company may also divest assets and/or businesses. Successfully executing such a strategy depends on various factors, including effectively transferring assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identifying and separating the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that the Company wishes to retain, reducing or eliminating fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collecting the proceeds from any divestitures.\nAny incurrence of additional indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, make payments on our debt, and make it more difficult for Lydall to obtain additional financing in the future - Incurring debt may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and may limit Lydall\u2019s ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes. Additionally, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to meet the additional debt obligations. Any default under the existing credit facility would likely result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations to the Company's lenders.\nThe Company may not have adequate cash to fund its operating requirements - The principal source of the Company\u2019s liquidity is operating cash flows. Other significant factors that affect the overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures, investments in businesses, acquisitions, income tax payments, pension funding, share repurchases, outcomes of contingencies and availability of lines of credit and long-term financing. The Company\u2019s liquidity can be impacted by the Company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nManage working capital and the level of future profitability. The consolidated cash balance is impacted by capital equipment and inventory investments that may be made in response to changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nSatisfy covenants and other obligations under its existing credit facility, which could limit or prohibit Lydall\u2019s ability to borrow funds. Additionally, these debt covenants and other obligations could limit the Company\u2019s ability to make acquisitions, incur additional debt, make investments, or consummate asset sales and obtain additional financing from other sources.\nThe Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which impose restrictions on the Company and violations of which may carry substantial fines and penalties and result in criminal sanctions - The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including anti-bribery legislation in the United Kingdom, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The Company\u2019s policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, violations of which often carry substantial fines and penalties and could result in criminal sanctions against the Company, Lydall\u2019s officers or employees. The Company cannot assure that its internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company\u2019s affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on Lydall\u2019s business, or financial statements and could cause the market price of Lydall\u2019s common stock to decline.\nRaw material pricing, supply issues, and disruptions in transportation networks could affect all of the Company\u2019s businesses - The Thermal/Acoustical Metals segment uses aluminum and other metals to manufacture most of its automotive heat shields. The Thermal/Acoustical Fibers and Industrial Filtration segments use various petroleum-derivative fibers in manufacturing products, and the Performance Materials segment uses various glass-derivative fibers in manufacturing products. If the prices of these raw materials, or any other raw materials used in the Company\u2019s businesses increase, the Company may not have the ability to pass incremental cost increases on to its customers. In addition, an interruption in the ability of the Company to source such materials could negatively impact operations and sales.\nImpairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill or other long-lived assets has required, and may in the future require recording significant charges to earnings - In 2015, the Company determined that its Solutech long-lived asset group was impaired. This was based on reviewing estimated undiscounted cash flows for its asset group, which were less than their carrying value. The asset group, included in the Performance Materials segment, primarily consists of patents and machinery and equipment. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, which represented the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset group compared to the carrying value of the asset group (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is also tested by the Company for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates.\nVolatility in the securities markets, interest rates, actuarial assumptions and other factors could substantially increase the Company\u2019s costs and funding for its domestic defined benefit pension plan - The Company\u2019s domestic defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets may affect the funded status and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of such plan. A significant increase in benefit plan liabilities or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Company is involved in certain legal proceedings and may become involved in future legal proceedings all of which could give rise to liability - The Company is involved in legal proceedings that, from time to time, may be material. These proceedings may include, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, stockholder claims, and employment matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Company is subject to an investigation by antitrust regulators and developments in these investigations and related matters could have a material adverse effect on Lydall's consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity - The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern our business both in the United States and internationally, including antitrust laws. Violations of antitrust laws can result in significant penalties being imposed by antitrust authorities. Expenses and fines arising out of or related to these investigations and related claims can also be significant. Lydall Gerhardi GmbH & Co. KG (\"Lydall Gerhardi\"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and part of the Thermal/Acoustical Metals segment, is cooperating with the German Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) in connection with an investigation, initiated in the second quarter of 2014, relating to possible violations of German anti-trust laws by and among certain European automotive heat shield manufacturers, including Lydall Gerhardi. The Company is conducting an internal investigation utilizing outside counsel. In the course of this internal investigation, the Company has discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain German employees of Lydall Gerhardi. The Company has disclosed its findings in an application for leniency submitted to the German Federal Cartel Office on July 22, 2014. The Company is continuing its internal investigation and has taken, and will continue to take, remedial actions. The German Federal Cartel Office has wide discretion in fixing the amount of a fine, up to a maximum fine of ten percent (10%) of the Company\u2019s annual revenue of the year preceding the year in which the fine is imposed. The Company believes a loss is probable. However, in light of the uncertainties and variables involved, the Company is unable to estimate either the timing or the amount of the loss associated with this matter. There can be no assurance that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business - The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions designed to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. In August 2012, the SEC promulgated disclosure and reporting requirements for companies who use conflict minerals in their products. These requirements may result in changes to the sourcing practices of the Company\u2019s customers which may require the identification and qualification of alternate sourcing for the components of products Lydall manufactures, which could impact the availability of, or cause increases in the price of, materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain necessary conflict free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.\nChanges in tax rates and exposure to additional income tax liabilities - The Company is subject to risks with respect to changes in tax law and rates, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that are in process or future tax audits in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition,\ncertain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the United States statutory rate. Changes in the mix and source of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is not assured - The Company maintains valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets where realization is not reasonably assured. The Company evaluates the likelihood of the realization of all deferred tax assets and reduces the carrying amount to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized. Changes in these assessments can result in an increase or reduction to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends upon its ability to continue to innovate, improve its existing products, develop and market new products, and identify and enter new markets - Improved performance and growth are partially dependent on improvements to existing products and new product introductions planned for the future. Delays in improving or developing products and long customer qualification cycles may impact the success of new product programs. The degree of success of new product programs could impact the Company\u2019s future results. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. Accordingly, our ability to compete is in part dependent on our ability to continually offer enhanced and improved products that meet the changing requirements of our customers. If we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign operations expose it to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks - The Company believes that in order to be competitive and grow its businesses, it needs to maintain significant foreign operations. Foreign sales were $179.6 million, $190.0 million and $128.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Foreign operations are subject to inherent risks including political and economic conditions in various countries, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements (including tariff regulations and trade restrictions), longer accounts receivable collection cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences. The Company has little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter its business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations and limitations on repatriation of earnings may affect the Company\u2019s results of operations - As a result of the Industrial Filtration acquisition, the Company\u2019s foreign operations expanded substantially and its financial results are more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of its assets, liabilities and expenses are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. During 2015, there was significant volatility in foreign currencies that impacted the Company, primarily the Euro, Chinese Yuan and British Pound Sterling. The Company\u2019s foreign and domestic operations seek to limit foreign currency exchange transaction risk by completing transactions in functional currencies whenever practical or through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts when deemed appropriate. If the Company does not successfully hedge its currency exposure, changes in the rate of exchange between these currencies and the U.S. dollar may negatively impact the Company. Translation of the results of operations and financial condition of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, limitations on the repatriation of earnings, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances, may limit or negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to redeploy or distribute cash. The Company receives a material portion of its revenue from foreign operations. Foreign operations generated approximately 34.2%, 35.5% and 32.1% of total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing processes are subject to inherent risk - The Company operates a number of manufacturing facilities and relies upon an effective workforce and properly performing machinery and equipment. The workforce may experience a relatively high turnover rate, causing inefficiencies associated with retraining and rehiring. The equipment and systems necessary for such operations may break down, perform poorly or fail, and possibly cause higher manufacturing costs. Manufacturing processes affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver quality products on a timely basis, and delays in delivering products to customers could result in the Company incurring penalties from customers.\nIncreases in energy pricing can affect all of the Company\u2019s businesses - Higher energy costs at the Company\u2019s manufacturing plants or higher energy costs passed on from the Company\u2019s vendors could impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s resources are limited and may impair its ability to capitalize on changes in technology, competition and pricing - The industries in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive and many of the competitors are affiliated with entities that are substantially larger and that have greater financial, technical and marketing resources. The Company\u2019s more limited resources and relatively diverse product mix may limit or impair its ability to capitalize on changes in technology, competition and pricing.\nThe Company\u2019s products may fail to perform as expected, subjecting it to warranty or other claims from its customers -If such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, the Company may be subject to product liability lawsuits, U.S. Food and Drug Administration product recalls and other claims, any of which could have a material adverse impact on results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company does not retain its key employees, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategy could be adversely affected - The Company\u2019s success, in part, depends on key managerial, engineering, sales and marketing and technical personnel and its ability to continue to attract and retain additional personnel. The loss of certain key personnel could have a material, adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. There is no assurance that the Company can retain its key employees or that it can attract competent and effective new or replacement personnel in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s current reserve levels may not be adequate to cover potential exposures - Estimates and assumptions may affect the reserves that the Company has established to cover uncollectible accounts receivable, excess or obsolete inventory, income tax valuation and fair market value write downs of certain assets and various liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could increase its expense and affect operating results - The Company is subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that affect operations. New and changing environmental laws and regulations may impact the products manufactured and sold to customers. In order to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations, the Company must devote significant resources and maintain and administer adequate policies, procedures and oversight. Should the Company fail to do these things, it could be negatively impacted by lower net sales, fines, legal costs, and clean-up requirements.\nThe Company may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, which may limit its ability to compete effectively - The Company owns intellectual property, including patents and trademarks, which play an important role in helping the Company to maintain its competitive position in a number of markets. The Company is subject to risks with respect to (i) changes in the intellectual property landscape of markets in which it competes; (ii) the potential assertion of intellectual property-related claims against the Company; (iii) the failure to maximize or successfully assert its intellectual property rights; and (iv) significant technological developments by others.\nDisruptions may occur to the Company\u2019s operations relating to information technology - The capacity, reliability and security of the Company\u2019s information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) hardware and software infrastructure and the ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to the Company\u2019s changing needs are important to the operation of the businesses. Also, any inadequacy, interruption, loss of data, integration failure or security failure of the Company\u2019s IT technology could harm its ability to effectively operate its business, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to the Company\u2019s systems, networks, and data - Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to the security of the Company\u2019s systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, the Company remains potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. The Company also may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of Lydall\u2019s businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. Despite efforts made by the Company to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, the Company may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action.\nThe Company could be subject to work stoppages or other business interruptions as a result of its unionized work force - A portion of the Company\u2019s hourly employees are represented by various union locals and covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements contain various expiration dates and must be renegotiated upon expiration. Specifically, three union contracts expiring on September 30, 2016 represent approximately 60 employees in the United States. If the Company is unable to negotiate any of its collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms prior to expiration, the Company could experience disruptions in its operations which could have a material adverse effect on operations.\nThe Company could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders - Over the last few years, proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. The Company could become engaged in a solicitation, or proxy contest, or experience other stockholder activism, in the future. Activist stockholders may advocate for certain governance and strategic changes at the Company. In the event of stockholder activism, particularly with respect to matters which our Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management, and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.", "PERMNO": 59774, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "LDL"}
