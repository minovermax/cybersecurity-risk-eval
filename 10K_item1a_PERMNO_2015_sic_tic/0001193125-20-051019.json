These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under \u201cCautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nStrategic Risks\nThe proposed transaction with China Oceanwide may not be completed or may not be completed within the timeframe, terms or in the manner currently anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stock price.\nOn October 21, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with China Oceanwide, under which China Oceanwide agreed to acquire all of our outstanding common stock for a total transaction value of approximately $2.7 billion, or $5.43 per share in cash. As part of the transaction, China Oceanwide and/or its affiliates, additionally committed to contribute an aggregate of $1.5 billion to us over time following consummation of the Merger. The transaction and this contribution are subject to the closing of the Merger and the receipt of required regulatory re-approvals and clearances. In addition, the transaction is conditioned on GMICO maintaining a financial strength rating of \u201cBB (negative outlook),\u201d or higher, by S&P, with limited exceptions.\nThere are numerous risks related to the transaction, including the following:\n\u2022 the risk that the parties will not be able to obtain the required regulatory re-approvals, clearances or extensions, or the possibility that such regulatory re-approvals or clearances may further delay the transaction or may not be received prior to March 31, 2020 (and either or both of the parties may not be willing to further waive their end date termination rights beyond March 31, 2020) or that materially burdensome or adverse regulatory conditions may be imposed or undesirable measures may be required in connection with any such regulatory re-approvals, clearances or extensions (including those conditions or measures that either or both of the parties may be unwilling to accept or undertake, as applicable);\n\u2022 with continuing delays, circumstances may arise that make one or both parties unwilling to proceed with the transaction or unable to comply with the conditions to existing regulatory approvals or one or both of the parties may be unwilling to accept any new condition under a regulatory re-approval;\n\u2022 the risk that the parties will not be able to obtain other regulatory approvals, re-approvals, clearances or extensions, including in connection with a potential alternative funding structure or the current geo-political environment;\n\u2022 one or more regulators may rescind or fail to extend existing approvals, or that the revocation by one regulator of approvals will lead to the revocation of approvals by other regulators;\n\u2022 the parties\u2019 inability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals, clearances or extensions for the post-closing capital plan;\n\u2022 the risk that a condition to closing the transaction may not be satisfied or that a condition to closing that is currently satisfied may not remain satisfied due to the delay in closing the transaction;\n\u2022 existing and potential legal proceedings may be instituted against us in connection with the transaction that may delay the transaction, make it more costly or ultimately preclude it;\n\u2022 the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts Genworth\u2019s current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transaction;\n\u2022 certain restrictions during the pendency of the transaction that may impact Genworth\u2019s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions;\n\u2022 continued availability of capital and financing to Genworth before, or in the absence of, the consummation of the transaction;\n\u2022 further rating agency actions and downgrades in Genworth\u2019s credit or financial strength ratings;\n\u2022 changes in applicable laws or regulations;\n\u2022 our ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the transaction;\n\u2022 the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and other charges related to the transaction, including costs and expenses related to conditions imposed in connection with regulatory approvals, re-approvals or clearances, which may be material;\n\u2022 the risks related to diverting management\u2019s attention from our ongoing business operations;\n\u2022 our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees may be adversely affected; and\n\u2022 disruptions and uncertainty relating to the transaction, whether or not it is completed, may harm our relationships with our employees, customers, distributors, vendors or other business partners, and may result in a negative impact on our business.\nThere is no assurance that the conditions to the transaction will be satisfied in a timely manner, on the terms set forth in our existing agreement with China Oceanwide or at all. If the transaction is not completed, we would likely suffer a number of consequences that could adversely affect our stock price, business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022 greater difficulty in executing alternative strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges (including with respect to stabilizing our U.S. life insurance businesses, debt obligations, cost savings, ratings and capital);\n\u2022 increased pressure on and potential further downgrades of our credit and financial strength ratings, particularly for our mortgage insurance businesses, which could have an adverse impact on our mortgage insurance businesses and could result in reduced dividends to our holding company;\n\u2022 a negative impact on our holding company liquidity and ability to reduce, service and/or refinance our holding company debt; and\n\u2022 we would likely pursue strategic alternatives that would materially impact our business, including a transaction with respect to our U.S. mortgage insurance business and/or our mortgage insurance business in Australia.\nPotential consequences of these risks would likely include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Genworth\u2019s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, credit ratings or liquidity.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the transaction, and these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the transaction is consummated.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges.\nWe continue to pursue our overall strategy with a focus on improving business performance, addressing financial leverage and increasing financial and strategic flexibility across the organization. Our strategy includes maximizing our opportunities in our mortgage insurance businesses and stabilizing our U.S. life insurance businesses. See \u201cItem 1 - Business-Strategic Update.\u201d\nWe cannot be sure we will be able to successfully execute on any of our strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges (including with respect to stabilizing our U.S. life insurance businesses, debt obligations, cost savings, ratings and capital), including as a result of: (a) a failure to complete the China Oceanwide transaction or the inability to pursue alternative strategic plans pending the transaction; (b) an inability to attract buyers for any businesses or other assets we may seek to sell, or securities we may seek to issue, in each case, in a timely manner and on anticipated terms; (c) an inability to increase the capital needed in our businesses in a timely manner and on anticipated terms, including through improved business performance, reinsurance or similar transactions, asset sales, securities offerings or otherwise, in each case as and when required; (d) a failure to obtain any required regulatory, stockholder, noteholder approvals and/or other third-party approvals or consents for such alternative strategic plans; (e) our challenges changing or being more costly or difficult to successfully address than currently anticipated or the benefits achieved being less than anticipated; (f) an inability to achieve anticipated cost-savings in a timely manner; and (g) adverse tax or accounting charges.\nIf the proposed transaction with China Oceanwide is not completed, we will continue to remain open to other feasible alternatives and actively assess our strategic options, which could include reducing ownership of or selling businesses and/or selling additional blocks of business, including in transactions that would be material to us. We may be unable to reduce ownership of or sell businesses, or complete any sale of additional blocks of business on acceptable terms or at all.\nEven if we are successful in executing our strategic plans or alternative plans, the execution of these plans may have expected or unexpected adverse consequences, including adverse rating actions and adverse tax and accounting charges (such as significant losses on sale of businesses or assets or deferred acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d) or deferred tax asset write-offs).\nWe may decide to take additional measures to increase our financial flexibility, in the absence of the China Oceanwide transaction, including issuing equity at Genworth Financial which would be dilutive to our shareholders, or additional debt at Genworth Financial or Genworth Holdings (including debt convertible into equity of Genworth Financial), which could increase our leverage. The availability of any additional debt or equity funding will depend on a variety of factors, including, market conditions, regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit and particularly, to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the performance of and outlook for our company and our businesses. Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain funding or complete asset sales to generate additional liquidity, especially on short notice and when the demand for additional funding in the market is high. Our access to funding may be further impaired by our credit or financial strength ratings and our financial condition. See \u201c-Our internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs and our access to capital may be limited or unavailable. Under such conditions, we may seek additional capital but may be unable to obtain it.\u201d\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase the capital needed in our businesses in a timely manner, on anticipated terms or at all, including through improved business performance, reinsurance or similar transactions, asset sales, securities offerings or otherwise, in each case as and when required.\nAdditional capital has been provided in the past, and if conditions require we expect additional capital could be provided in the future, to our mortgage insurance businesses as necessary (and to the extent we determine it is appropriate to do so) to meet regulatory or GSE capital requirements, comply with rating agency criteria to\nmaintain ratings and provide capital and liquidity buffers for these businesses to operate and meet unexpected cash flow obligations. We have no intention to contribute additional capital to support our legacy long-term care insurance business. We may not be able to fund or raise the required capital as and when required and the amount of capital required may be higher than anticipated, particularly in the absence of the China Oceanwide transaction. Our inability to fund or raise the capital required in the anticipated timeframes and on the anticipated terms, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including causing us to reduce our business levels or be subject to a variety of regulatory actions. See \u201c-Our internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs and our access to capital may be limited or unavailable. Under such conditions, we may seek additional capital but may be unable to obtain it.\u201d\nIn addition, we intend to continue to support the increased capital needs of our U.S. mortgage insurance business resulting from PMIERs. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our U.S. mortgage insurance business met the PMIERs financial and operational requirements, and holds a reasonable amount in excess of the financial requirements. In order to continue to provide a prudent level of financial flexibility in connection with the PMIERs capital requirements given the dynamic nature of asset valuations and requirement changes over time, our U.S. mortgage insurance business may be required, particularly in the absence of the China Oceanwide transaction, to execute future capital transactions, including additional reinsurance transactions and contributions of holding company cash. See \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nThe implementation of any further reinsurance transactions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to: the completion of the China Oceanwide transaction, market conditions, third-party approvals or other actions (including approval by regulators and the GSEs), and other factors which are outside of our control, and therefore we cannot be sure we will be able to successfully implement these actions on the anticipated timetable and terms or at all, or achieve the anticipated benefits. For a discussion of risks related to our strategic plans, see \u201c-We may be unable to successfully execute strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations\nIf our reserves for future policy claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future payments of claims to our policyholders and contractholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices. We release these reserves as those future obligations are paid, experience changes or policies lapse. The reserves we establish reflect estimates and actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience. These estimates and actuarial assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment. Our future financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions and methodologies we have used in pricing our products and calculating our reserves. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition. Many factors, and changes in these factors, can affect future experience, including but not limited to: interest rates; investment returns and volatility; economic and social conditions, such as inflation, unemployment, home price appreciation or depreciation, and health care experience (including the type of care, and cost of care); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the probability that a policy or contract will remain in-force from one period to the next); insured mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); insured morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates, claim incidence and benefit utilization rates); future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions; expenses; and doctrines of legal liability and\ndamage awards in litigation. Because these factors are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. For information regarding adequacy of reserves specifically related to our long-term care insurance, life insurance and annuities businesses, see \u201c-We may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe regularly review our reserves and associated assumptions as part of our ongoing assessment of our business performance and risks. If we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claim payments as a result of changes in experience, assumptions or otherwise, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur charges in the period in which we make the determination. The amounts of such increases may be significant and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor additional information on reserves, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nIf the models used in our businesses are inaccurate or there are differences and/or variability in loss development compared to our model estimates and actuarial assumptions, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe employ models to, among other uses, price products, calculate reserves, value assets, make investment decisions and generate projections used to estimate future pre-tax income, such as the timing of the recognition of earned premium in our mortgage insurance businesses that offer single premium insurance contracts, and to evaluate loss recognition testing, as well as to evaluate risk, determine internal capital requirements and perform stress testing. These models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use data and/or assumptions that do not adequately reflect recent experience and relevant industry data, and may not operate as intended. In addition, from time to time we seek to improve certain actuarial and financial models, and the conversion process may result in material changes to assumptions and financial results. The models we employ are complex, which increases our risk of error in their design, implementation or use. Also, the associated input data, assumptions and calculations and the controls we have in place to mitigate these risks may not be effective in all cases. The risks related to our models often increase when we change assumptions and/or methodologies, add or change modeling platforms or implement model changes under time constraints. These risks are exacerbated when the process for assumption changes strains our overall governance and timing around our financial reporting.\nWe intend to continue developing our modeling capabilities in our various U.S. life insurance businesses. During or after the implementation of model updates or enhancements, we may discover errors or other deficiencies in existing models, assumptions and/or methodologies. Moreover, we may use additional, more granular and detailed information through enhancements in our reserving and other processes or we may employ more simplified approaches in the future, either of which may cause us to refine or otherwise change existing assumptions and/or methodologies and thus associated reserve levels, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor our mortgage insurance businesses that offer single premium insurance contracts, recognition of earned premiums involves significant estimates and assumptions as to future loss development and policy cancellations. These assumptions are based on our historical experience and our expectations of future performance, which are highly dependent on modeling assumptions as to long-term macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, home price appreciation and the rate of unemployment. In our mortgage insurance business in Australia, the majority of our current insurance contracts have a single premium, which is paid at the beginning of the contract.\nFor single premium insurance contracts, we recognize premiums over the policy life in accordance with the expected pattern of risk emergence. We recognize a portion of the revenue in premiums earned in the current period, while the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over time in accordance with the expected pattern of risk emergence.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $1.4 billion of unearned premiums\nin our mortgage insurance businesses\n, of which $1.0 billion related to our mortgage insurance business in Australia. We periodically review our expected pattern of risk emergence and make adjustments to earnings patterns based on actual experience and changes in our expectation of future performance with any adjustments reflected in current period net income. For example, we increased unearned premiums and reduced earned premiums in our Australia mortgage insurance business following a review of its premium earnings pattern in the fourth quarter of 2017, which materially impacted our financial results. See \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Mortgage insurance-Unearned premiums\u201d for additional details. Our expected pattern of risk emergence for our mortgage insurance businesses is subject to change given the inherent uncertainty as to the underlying loss development and policy cancellation assumptions and the long duration of our mortgage insurance policy contracts. Therefore, actual future experience that is different than expected loss development or policy cancellations could result in further material increases or decreases in the recognition of earned premiums, increases or decreases in unearned premiums and additional after-tax charges to operating results depending on the magnitude of the difference between actual and expected experience.\nWe may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe expected future profitability of our long-term care insurance, life insurance and some annuity products are based upon assumptions for, among other things, projected interest rates and investment returns, health care experience, morbidity rates, mortality rates, in-force rate actions, persistency, lapses and expenses. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing and valuation assumptions. If any of our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our reserves may be inadequate, which in the past has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. For example, if morbidity rates are higher than our valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments and thus establish additional reserves under our long-term care insurance policies than we had expected, and such amounts could be significant. Likewise, if mortality rates are lower than our valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments and thus establish additional reserves under both our long-term care insurance policies and annuity contracts and such amounts could be significant. Conversely, if mortality rates are higher than our pricing and valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits (\u201cGMDBs\u201d) than we had projected. Moreover, changes in the assumptions we use can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Even small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our DAC amortization, reserve levels, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor example, we have increased our reserves for our long-term care and/or life insurance products following completion of our annual review of assumptions in 2019, 2018 and 2017, which have materially impacted our results of operations. See \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and note 9 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information. Increases to our reserves may, among other things, limit our ability to execute our alternative strategic plans if the proposed transaction with China Oceanwide is not completed; reduce our liquidity; and adversely impact our credit or financial strength ratings. Any of these results could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our valuation assumptions is particularly significant for our long-term care insurance products. Long-term care insurance policies provide for long-\nduration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge over many years, or decades, after both pricing and locked-in valuation assumptions have been established. For example, among other factors, changes in economic and interest rate risk, socio-demographics, behavioral trends (e.g., location of care and level of benefit use) and medical advances, may have a material adverse impact on our future claims trends. Moreover, long-term care insurance does not have the extensive claims experience history of life insurance. As a consequence, given that recent experience will represent a larger proportion of total experience, our long-term care insurance assumptions will be more heavily influenced by recent experience. It follows that our ability to forecast future claim costs for long-term care insurance is more limited than for life insurance. For additional information on our long-term care insurance reserves, including the significant historical financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nThe prices and expected future profitability of our insurance and annuity products are based in part upon expected patterns of premiums, expenses and benefits, using a number of assumptions, including those related to persistency, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in-force from one period to the next. The effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products. For most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract. For our deferred annuity products with GMWBs and guaranteed annuitization benefits, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability because we could be required to make withdrawal or annuitization payments for a longer period of time than the account value would support. For our universal life insurance policies, increased persistency that is the result of the sale of policies by the insured to third parties that continue to make premium payments on policies that would otherwise have lapsed, also known as life settlements, could have an adverse impact on profitability because of the higher claims rate associated with settled policies.\nFor our long-term care insurance policies, actual persistency in later policy durations that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain in-force longer than we assumed, then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced these products. This risk is particularly significant in our long-term care insurance business because we do not have the experience history that we have in our life insurance business. As a result, our ability to predict persistency and resulting benefit experience for long-term care insurance is more limited than for many other products. A significant number of our long-term care insurance policies have experienced higher persistency than we had originally assumed, which has resulted in higher claims and an adverse effect on the profitability of that business. In addition, the impact of inflation on claims could be more pronounced for our long-term care insurance business than our other businesses given the \u201clong tail\u201d nature of this business. To the extent inflation causes these health care costs to increase, we will be required to increase our claim reserves which would also negatively impact our loss recognition testing results and could result in a premium deficiency. Although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates, our premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation and may result in our underpricing of the risks we insure.\nThe risk that our lapse experience may differ significantly from our valuation assumptions is also significant for our term life and term universal life insurance products. These products generally have a level premium period for a specified period of years (e.g., 10 years to 30 years) after which the premium increases, which may be significant. If the frequency of lapses is higher than our reserve assumptions, we would experience higher DAC amortization and lower premiums and could experience higher benefit costs. In addition, it may be that healthy policyholders are the ones who lapse (as they can more easily replace coverage), creating adverse selection where less healthy policyholders remain in our portfolio. We have experienced both a greater frequency of policyholder lapses and more severe adverse selection, after the level premium period, and this experience could continue or worsen. For example, as our large 10- and 15-year level premium period term life insurance policies written in 1999 and 2000 transitioned to their post-level guaranteed premium rate period, we have experienced lower persistency compared to our pricing and valuation assumptions which accelerated DAC\namortization in previous years. As our large 20-year level premium period business written in 1999 has entered its post-level period during 2019, we have also experienced higher lapses resulting in accelerated DAC amortization in 2019. We anticipate this trend will continue into 2020 for the 1999 block as it reaches the end of its level premium period. Additionally, we expect similar experience with the 20-year level premium period business written in 2000 as it enters its post-level period during 2020 and into 2021. In the future, as additional 10-, 15- and 20-year level premium period blocks enter their post-level guaranteed premium rate period, we expect to experience volatility in DAC amortization, premiums and mortality experience, which we expect to reduce profitability in our term life insurance products, in amounts that could be material, if persistency is lower than our original assumptions. For additional information on our term life insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nAlthough some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability or that such increases would be approved by regulators or approved in a timely manner, where approval is required. Moreover, many of our products either do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract. Significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. In addition to our annual reviews, we regularly review our methodologies and assumptions in light of emerging experience and may be required to make further adjustments to reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuities businesses in the future. Any changes to these reserves may have a materially negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nLoss recognition testing\nWe annually perform loss recognition testing for the liability for future policy benefits. Our loss recognition testing for our long-term care insurance products is reviewed in the aggregate, excluding our acquired block of long-term care insurance, which is tested separately. Our long-term care insurance business, excluding the acquired block, has positive margin which is highly dependent on the assumptions we have regarding our ability to successfully implement our in-force management strategy involving premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. We include future in-force rate actions in our loss recognition testing which includes assumptions for significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions that have been approved or are anticipated to be approved (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed). A change in the expected amount of premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions would impact the results of our long-term care insurance margin testing, whereby any unexpected reduction in the amount of future in-force rate actions would negatively impact our margins and could result in a premium deficiency which would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, capital levels, RBC and financial condition. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for the future in-force rate actions we have assumed in connection with our loss recognition testing. Favorable impacts on our margin from in-force rate actions would primarily impact our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block. Our acquired block would not benefit significantly from future in-force rate actions as it is older. For our acquired block of long-term care insurance, the impacts of any adverse changes in assumptions are more likely to be recorded as a loss as our margin for this block has been zero in the past.\nThe assumptions in our long-term care insurance products are sensitive to slight variability in actual experience and small changes in assumptions could result in the margin of our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block to decrease to at/or below zero in future years. Based on our reviews, if our margin is negative, we would be required to recognize a loss by amortizing more DAC and/or establishing additional benefit reserves, the impact of which may be material. A significant decrease in our loss recognition testing margin, the need to amortize a significant amount of DAC and/or the need to significantly increase reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on our long-term care insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nSimilar to our long-term care insurance products, we annually perform loss recognition testing for our term and whole life insurance products in the aggregate, excluding our acquired block, which is tested separately. The margin of our term and whole life insurance products has fluctuated over the years. Any adverse changes in our assumptions could negatively impact the combined margin of our term and whole life insurance products. To the extent, based on reviews, our margin is negative, for either our term and whole life insurance products, excluding our acquired block, or our acquired block of term and whole life insurance products, we would be required to recognize a loss by amortizing more DAC and/or present value of future profits (\u201cPVFP\u201d) as well as the establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves if the DAC and/or PVFP was fully written off. A significant decrease in our loss recognition testing margin, the need to amortize a significant amount of DAC and/or PVFP or the need to significantly increase reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on our term life insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nAs part of our annual loss recognition testing, we also review assumptions for incidence, claim severity and interest rates, among other assumptions. We regularly review our methodologies and assumptions in light of emerging experience and may be required to make further adjustments to our long-term care insurance claim reserves in the future, which could also impact our loss recognition testing results, as described above. In addition, we will also continue to monitor our experience and assumptions closely and make changes to our assumptions and methodologies, as appropriate, for other U.S. life insurance products. As experience has emerged in the past, we have made resulting changes to our assumptions that have had a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our experience will continue to emerge and as a result there is a potential for future assumption reviews to result in further updates.\nCash flow testing\nWe also perform cash flow testing or \u201casset adequacy analysis\u201d separately for each of our U.S. life insurance companies on a statutory accounting basis. To the extent that the cash flow testing margin is negative in any of our U.S. life insurance companies, we would need to increase statutory reserves in that company, which would decrease our RBC ratios.\nThe NYDFS, which regulates GLICNY, our New York insurance subsidiary\n, has required specific adequacy testing scenarios that are generally more severe than those deemed acceptable in other states. Moreover, the required testing scenarios by the NYDFS have a disproportionate impact on our long-term care insurance products. The NYDFS annually informs the industry that it does not permit in-force\nrate increases for long-term care insurance to be used in asset adequacy analysis until such increases have been approved. However, the NYDFS has allowed GLICNY to incorporate recently filed in-force\nrate actions in its asset adequacy analysis prior to approval in the past. Moreover, the NYDFS has consistently granted approval for GLICNY to spread asset adequacy analysis reserve deficiencies related to its long-term care insurance business over future years. After discussions with the NYDFS and through the exercise of professional actuarial judgment, GLICNY incorporated in its 2019 asset adequacy analysis recently filed in-force\nrate actions for newer long-term care insurance\nproducts to offset emerging adverse experience for those products. As a result, GLICNY\u2019s 2019 asset adequacy analysis would have produced a very modest positive margin. However, there is an actuarial opinion requirement to address events subsequent to year end through the signing of the actuarial opinion. Given the Treasury yield curve rate decreased across all maturities from December 31, 2019 through February 13, 2020, the date that GLICNY\u2019s actuarial opinion was signed, GLICNY\u2019s asset adequacy testing turned from a very modest positive margin to a deficit of $16 million. GLICNY did not spread the deficit over future years. The incremental $16 million of additional statutory\nreserves established in 2019, when combined with the $454 million of previously established asset adequacy deficiency reserves as of December 31,\n2018, increased the aggregate amount of additional actuarial statutory\nreserves established by GLICNY for asset adequacy deficits to $470 million as of December 31, 2019.\nAs a part of our cash flow testing process for our life insurance subsidiaries, we consider incremental benefits from expected future in-force rate actions that would help mitigate the impact of deteriorating experience. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for the future in-force rate actions we assumed in connection with our cash flow testing for our life insurance subsidiaries. A need to significantly further increase statutory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information regarding impacts to statutory capital as a result of reserve increases, see \u201c-An adverse change in our regulatory requirements, including risk-based capital, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\u201d\nIn addition, we have historically used nationwide experience for setting assumptions in our long-term care insurance products in cash flow testing for all of our legal entities, including GLICNY, which is consistent with industry practice given the lack of statistical credibility for other approaches. While we are starting to see emerging experience regarding higher severity in our New York policyholders as compared to our nationwide experience, this experience is limited and additional data and analysis is needed before we deem it credible. Significant changes to this assumption, future in-force rate action assumptions or other assumptions could result in the cash flow testing margin in GLINCY to decrease to at/or below zero in future years. A significant decrease in GLICNY\u2019s cash flow testing margin and/or the need to significantly increase statutory reserves could have a material adverse effect on GLICNY\u2019s financial condition and RBC ratio.\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits, which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability.\nDAC represents costs related to the successful acquisition of our insurance policies and investment contracts, which are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies and investment contracts. These costs primarily consist of commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions and underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses incurred on policies and contracts successfully acquired. Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is subsequently amortized to income, over the lives of the underlying contracts, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits. In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies or investment contracts, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from the acquired block of insurance and investment contracts and policies. This intangible asset, called PVFP, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.\nOur amortization of DAC and PVFP generally depends upon, among other items, anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy and contract charges, mortality, morbidity and maintenance expense margins. Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or PVFP, or both, or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves, and such increases could be material. For additional information regarding impacts to DAC as a result of lapses of our term life insurance products, see \u201c-We may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe regularly review DAC and PVFP to determine if they are recoverable from future income. If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged as expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination. For example, if we determine that we are unable to recover DAC from profits over the life of a block of insurance policies or annuity contracts, or if withdrawals or surrender charges associated with early withdrawals do not fully offset the unamortized acquisition costs related to those policies or annuities, we would be required to recognize the additional DAC amortization as an expense in the current period. Equity market volatility could result in losses in our variable annuity products and associated hedging program which could challenge our ability to recover DAC on these products and could lead to further write-offs of DAC.\nFor additional information on DAC and PVFP, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates.\u201d\nWhen we have projected profits in earlier years followed by projected losses in later years (as is currently the case with our long-term care insurance business), we are required to increase our reserve liabilities over time to offset the projected future losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future payments of claims to our policyholders and contractholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices. When we conclude that our reserves are insufficient by line of business to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claim payments as a result of changes in experience, assumptions or otherwise, we are required to increase our reserves and incur charges in the period in which we make the determination. For certain long-duration products in our U.S. Life Insurance segment, we are also required to accrue additional reserves over time when the overall reserve is adequate by line of business, but profits are projected in earlier years followed by losses projected in later years. When this pattern of profits followed by losses exists for these products, and we determine that an additional reserve liability is required, we increase reserves in the years we expect to be profitable by the amounts necessary to offset losses projected in later years.\nIn our long-term care insurance products, projected profits followed by projected losses are anticipated to occur because U.S. GAAP requires that original assumptions be used in determining reserves for future policy claims unless and until a premium deficiency exists. Our existing locked-in reserve assumptions do not include assumptions for premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions, which if included in reserves, could reduce or eliminate future projected losses. As a result of this pattern of projected profits followed by projected losses, we are required to accrue additional future policy benefit reserves in the profitable years, currently expected to be through 2033, by the amounts necessary to offset losses in later years. The accrual, which is updated annually at the time we perform loss recognition testing, is impacted by the reserve pattern and the present value of expected future losses. Likewise, the accrual is subject to significant estimation and includes various assumptions that are sensitive to variability; small changes in assumptions could result in volatility of the accrued amount in any given year. Moreover, the amount required to accrue for additional future policy benefits in the profitable years may be significant and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For additional information, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits.\u201d\nOur valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities uses methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to change and differing interpretations which could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe report fixed maturity, equity and trading securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. These securities represent the majority of our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets. Our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consists primarily of investment grade securities. Valuations use inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, as well as valuation methods that are more complex or require greater estimation, thereby resulting in values that are less certain and may vary significantly from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. The methodologies, estimates and assumptions we use in valuing our investment securities evolve over time and are subject to different interpretation (including based on developments in relevant accounting literature), all of which can lead to changes in the value of our investment securities. Rapidly changing and unanticipated interest rate, external macroeconomic, credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of investment securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Economic, Market and Political Conditions\nInterest rates and changes in rates could materially adversely affect our business and profitability.\nOur products and investment portfolio are impacted by interest rate fluctuations and/or a sustained period of low interest rates. In recent years, historic low interest rates have adversely impacted our business and profitability. For example, as part of our annual review of assumptions for our universal and term universal life insurance products, we increased the liability for policyholder account balances in 2019, 2018 and 2017 as a result of lower expected growth in interest rates and a prolonged low interest rate environment. For additional information, including the historical financial impact of these updates, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Policyholder account balances.\u201d Persistent low interest rates have impacted the margins of our fixed immediate annuity products. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we performed loss recognition testing and determined that we had premium deficiencies in our fixed immediate annuity products primarily driven by the low interest rate environment. For additional information, including the historical financial impact of the premium deficiencies, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits.\u201d Sustained low interest rates also adversely impact our long-term care insurance margin, which are sensitive to assumption changes, including future investment returns. If interest rates remain at historic lows, our future profitability and business would be adversely impacted.\nOur insurance and investment products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to the risk that declines in interest rates or tightening credit spreads will reduce our interest rate margin (the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the amounts that we pay to policyholders and contractholders). We may reduce the interest rates we credit on most of these products only at limited, pre-established intervals, and some contracts have guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates. As a result of recent historic low interest rates, declines in our interest rate margin on these products have adversely impacted our business and profitability.\nDuring periods of increasing market interest rates, we may increase crediting rates on interest-sensitive in-force products, such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities. Rapidly rising interest rates may lead to increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, as policyholders and contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments. Increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including the requirement to liquidate fixed-income investments in an unrealized loss position to satisfy surrenders or withdrawals.\nIn our U.S. mortgage insurance business, declining interest rates historically have increased the rate at which borrowers refinance their existing mortgages in the United States, resulting in cancellations of the mortgage insurance covering the refinanced loans. Declining interest rates historically have also contributed to home price appreciation, which may provide borrowers in the United States with the option of cancelling their mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipated when pricing that coverage. These cancellations could have a material adverse effect on the results of our U.S. mortgage insurance business.\nIn both the United States and international mortgage markets, rising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgage originations. A decline in the volume of new mortgage originations would have an adverse effect on our new insurance written. Rising interest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for insured homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages (\u201cARMs\u201d) that could have the effect of increasing default rates on ARM loans, thereby increasing our exposure on our mortgage insurance policies. This is particularly relevant in our international mortgage insurance businesses where ARMs and shorter-term fixed rate loans are the predominant mortgage products. Higher interest rates can lead to an increase in defaults as borrowers at risk of default will find it harder to qualify for a replacement loan.\nInterest rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, by increasing reinvestment risk and reducing our ability to achieve our targeted investment returns. During periods of declining market interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. In addition, during those periods, we reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed-income securities may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates our reinvestment risk. Low interest rates reduce the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under long-term care insurance, life insurance and annuity products, which increases reinvestment risk and reduces our ability to achieve our targeted investment returns. The pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns. Generally, life and long-term care insurance products are expected to initially produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as they are received. The premiums, along with accumulated investment earnings, are needed to pay claims, which are generally expected to exceed premiums in later years. Low interest rates increase reinvestment risk and reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and may adversely affect the profitability of our life insurance, long-term care insurance and fixed annuity products and may increase hedging costs on our in-force block of variable annuity products. Given the average life of our assets is shorter than the average life of the liabilities on these products, our reinvestment risk is also greater in low interest rate environments as a significant portion of cash flows used to pay benefits to our policyholders and contractholders comes from investment returns. During periods of increasing interest rates, market values of lower-yielding assets will decline resulting in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio. In addition, our interest rate hedges could decline which would require us to post additional collateral with our derivative counterparties. Posting additional collateral could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by reducing our liquidity and net investment income, to the extent that the additional collateral posting requires us to invest in higher-quality, lower-yielding investments.\nA low interest rate environment also negatively impacts the sufficiency of our margins on both our DAC and PVFP. If interest rates remain at historic lows for a prolonged period, it could result in an impairment of these assets, and may reduce funds available to pay claims, including life and long-term care insurance claims, requiring an increase in our reserve liabilities, which could be significant. In addition, certain statutory capital requirements for our U.S. life insurance companies are based on models that consider interest rates. Prolonged periods of low interest rates may increase the statutory reserves we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets and capital we must maintain to support amounts of statutory reserves in these companies. Interest rate fluctuations could also impact our capital or solvency ratios in our international mortgage insurance business where the required or available capital could be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), with its full elimination to occur after 2021. We have LIBOR-based derivative instruments and investments. Regulatory and industry initiatives to eliminate LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark may create uncertainty in the valuation of our LIBOR-based derivative instruments and investments. In addition, our floating rate junior subordinated notes, due 2066, are indexed to LIBOR. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the elimination of LIBOR will have on financial markets, nor our investment valuations, hedge accounting, long-term borrowings and liquidity; however, it is possible it could adversely impact our derivative instruments and our investment portfolio and we may be unable to negotiate or amend our existing contracts with terms that are favorable to us. See \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Investments and Derivative Instruments\u201d for additional information about the transition from LIBOR.\nSee \u201cPart II-Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional information about interest rate risk.\nA deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home prices may adversely affect our loss experience in our mortgage insurance businesses.\nLosses in our mortgage insurance businesses generally result from events, such as a borrower\u2019s reduction of income, unemployment, underemployment, divorce, illness, inability to manage credit, or a change in interest rate levels or home values, that reduce a borrower\u2019s willingness or ability to continue to make mortgage payments. The amount of the loss we suffer, if any, depends in part on whether the home of a borrower who defaults on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover unpaid principal and interest and the expenses of the sale. A deterioration in economic conditions generally increases the likelihood that borrowers will not have sufficient income to pay their mortgages and can also adversely affect housing values, which increases our risk of loss. A decline in home prices, whether or not in conjunction with deteriorating economic conditions, may also increase our risk of loss. Furthermore, our estimates of claims-paying resources and claim obligations are based on various assumptions, which include the timing of the receipt of claims on loans in our delinquency inventory and future claims that we anticipate will ultimately be received, our anticipated loss mitigation activities, premiums, housing prices and unemployment rates. These assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and require judgment by management.\nIn the United States, we have experienced previous economic slowdowns where we saw a pronounced weakness in the housing market, as well as declines in home prices. The slowdown and the resulting impact on the housing market drove historic levels of delinquencies. The largest portion of loss reserves within our U.S. mortgage insurance business reside in policy years 2005 through 2008, the last time period of distinct housing weakness in the United States. The size of these policy years at origination combined with the significant decline in home prices led to significant losses in years prior to 2015. Any delays in foreclosure processes from these policy years could cause our losses to increase as expenses are accrued for longer periods or if the value of foreclosed homes further decline during such delays. If we experience an increase in the number or the cost of delinquencies that is higher than expected, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the past, low commodity prices, particularly oil, have resulted in a rise in unemployment in countries and certain regions within those countries where we conduct business. The adverse economic conditions in these countries and certain regions within those countries could deteriorate like we have experienced in the past which could impact the broader economies in those countries as well as the global economy, resulting in higher delinquencies as well as declines in home prices, which could have an unfavorable impact on the results of our operations for those businesses affected.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nOur insurance businesses are extensively regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nOur insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations and are extensively regulated. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. Our international operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or to obtain or maintain appropriate authorizations or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or engage in activities regulated in one or more jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the nature and extent of regulation of our activities in applicable jurisdictions could materially change causing a material adverse effect on our business.\nInsurance regulatory authorities in the United States and internationally have broad administrative powers, which at times, are coordinated and communicated across regulatory bodies. These administrative powers include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 licensing companies and agents to transact business;\n\u2022 calculating the value of assets and determining the eligibility of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;\n\u2022 mandating certain insurance benefits;\n\u2022 regulating certain premium rates;\n\u2022 reviewing and approving policy forms;\n\u2022 regulating discrimination in pricing and coverage terms and unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;\n\u2022 establishing and revising statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;\n\u2022 fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;\n\u2022 approving premium increases and associated benefit reductions;\n\u2022 evaluating enterprise risk to an insurer;\n\u2022 approving changes in control of insurance companies;\n\u2022 restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates;\n\u2022 regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments;\n\u2022 restricting the types of insurance products that may be offered; and\n\u2022 imposing insurance eligibility criteria.\nState insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to SAP, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Any proposed or future legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. Further, because laws and regulations can be complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal, accounting or reserving issue may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. The application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may differ from those of state insurance departments. We cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. The result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating costs and/or have implications on certain tax positions.\nRegulators in the United States and internationally have developed criteria under which they are subjecting non-bank financial companies, including insurance companies, that are deemed systemically important to higher regulatory capital requirements and stricter prudential standards. Although neither we nor any of our subsidiaries have been designated systemically important, we cannot predict whether we or any of our subsidiaries will be deemed systemically important in the future or how such a designation would impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations or other actions are common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\nWe face the risk of litigation and regulatory investigations or other actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate.\nIn our insurance operations, we are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, increases to in-force long-term care and life insurance premiums, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, claims payments and procedures, cancellation or rescission of coverage, product design, product disclosure, product administration, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, charging excessive or impermissible fees on products, recommending unsuitable products to customers, our pricing structures and business practices in our mortgage insurance businesses, such as captive reinsurance arrangements with lenders and contract underwriting services, violations of RESPA or related state anti-inducement laws and breaching fiduciary or other duties to customers. In our investment-related operations, we are subject to litigation involving commercial disputes with counterparties. In addition, we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, books and record examinations and market conduct and financial examinations, from state, federal and international regulators and other authorities. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us, as well as regulators, may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nWe are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as our contractual and employment relationships and we are also subject to shareholder putative class action lawsuits alleging securities law violations.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action (including uncertainty about the outcome of pending legal and regulatory investigations and actions) against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm and incur significant legal expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. At this time, it is not feasible to predict, nor determine, the ultimate outcomes of any pending investigations and legal proceedings, nor to provide reasonable ranges of possible losses other than those that have been disclosed.\nFor a further discussion of certain current investigations and proceedings in which we are involved, particularly the case captioned \u201cAXA S.A. v. Genworth Financial International Holdings, LLC et al.,\u201d\nsee note 21 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Significant cash demands are being asserted under this case and it is possible we may be ordered to pay large settlements under final court ruling. In addition, any payments to AXA would be made in British pound sterling, also exposing us to changes in foreign exchange rates. See \u201c-Our internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs and our access to capital may be limited or unavailable. Under such conditions, we may seek additional capital but may be unable to obtain it\u201d for additional risks related to our liquidity. We cannot assure you that these investigations and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. In addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or legal proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn adverse change in our regulatory requirements, including risk-based capital, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nOur U.S. life insurance subsidiaries are subject to the NAIC\u2019s RBC standards and other minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of their respective states of domicile. The failure of our\ninsurance subsidiaries to meet applicable RBC requirements or minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements could subject our insurance subsidiaries to further examination or corrective action imposed by state insurance regulators, including limitations on their ability to write additional business, or the addition of state regulatory supervision, rehabilitation, seizure or liquidation. As of December 31, 2019, the RBC of each of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of RBC that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action in their respective domiciliary state. However, the RBC ratio of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries has declined over the past few years as a result of statutory losses driven by the declining performance of the business and increases in our statutory reserves, including results of Actuarial Guideline 38, cash flow testing and assumption reviews particularly in our long-term care and life insurance businesses. Any future statutory losses would decrease the RBC ratio of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries. We continue to face challenges in our principal life insurance subsidiaries, particularly those subsidiaries that rely heavily on in-force rate actions as a source of earnings and capital. We may see variability in statutory results and a further decline in the RBC ratios of these subsidiaries given the time lag between the approval of in-force rate actions versus when the benefits from the in-force rate actions (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions) are fully realized in our financial results. Further declines in the RBC ratio of our life insurance subsidiaries could result in heightened supervision and regulatory action.\nOur U.S. mortgage insurers are not subject to the NAIC\u2019s RBC requirements but are required by certain states and other regulators to maintain a certain risk-to-capital ratio. In addition, PMIERs includes financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer\u2019s \u201cAvailable Assets\u201d (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed \u201cMinimum Required Assets\u201d (which are based on an insurer\u2019s risk-in-force and are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount). The failure of our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries to meet their regulatory requirements, and additionally the PMIERs financial requirements, could limit our ability to write new business. For further discussion of the importance of financial requirements to our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries, see \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d and \u201c-Our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum statutory capital requirements, which if not met or waived, would result in restrictions or prohibitions on our doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\u201d\nA further adverse change in our RBC, risk-to-capital ratio or other minimum regulatory requirements could cause rating agencies to further downgrade the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the credit ratings of Genworth Holdings, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to write and retain business, and could cause regulators to take regulatory or supervisory actions with respect to our businesses, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nChanges to the role of the GSEs or to the charters or business practices of the GSEs, including actions or decisions to decrease or discontinue the use of mortgage insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or significantly impact our business.\nThe requirements and practices of the GSEs impact the operating results and financial performance of approved insurers, including us. Changes in the charters or business practices of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae could materially reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently diminish the value of our business. The GSEs could be directed to make such changes by the FHFA, which was appointed as their conservator in September 2008 and has the authority to control and direct the operations of the GSEs.\nWith the GSEs in a prolonged conservatorship, there has been ongoing debate over the future role and purpose of the GSEs in the housing market. Congress may legislate, or the administration may implement through administrative reform, structural and other changes to the GSEs and the functioning of the secondary mortgage market. Since 2011, there have been numerous legislative proposals intended to incrementally scale\nback the GSEs (such as a statutory mandate for the GSEs to transfer mortgage credit risk to the private sector) or to completely reform the housing finance system. Congress, however, has not enacted any legislation to date. Recently, there has been increased focus on and discussion of administrative reform independent of legislative action. The proposals vary with regard to the government\u2019s role in the housing market, and more specifically, with regard to the existence of an explicit or implicit government guarantee. If any GSE reform is adopted, whether through legislation or administrative action, it could impact the current role of private mortgage insurance as a credit enhancement, including its reduction or elimination, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the term of the former FHFA director expired in 2018, and a new director was confirmed in April 2019. The new director may implement different objectives with regard to the GSEs\u2019 operations and activities. As a result of these matters, it is uncertain what role private capital, including mortgage insurance, will play in the U.S. residential housing finance system in the future or the impact any such changes could have on our business. Any changes to the charters or statutory authorities of the GSEs would require Congressional action to implement. Passage and timing of any comprehensive GSE reform or incremental change (legislative or administrative) is uncertain, making the actual impact on us and our industry difficult to predict. Any such changes that come to pass could have a significant impact on our business.\nIn recent years, the FHFA has set goals for the GSEs to transfer significant portions of the GSE\u2019 mortgage credit risk to the private sector. This mandate builds upon the goals set in each of the last four years for the GSEs to increase the role of private capital by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. We have participated in credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a limited basis. In 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced the launch of limited pilot programs,\nIntegrated Mortgage Insurance (\u201c\nIMAGIN\n\u201d)\nand\nEnterprise Paid Mortgage Insurance (\u201c\nEPMI\n\u201d),\nrespectively, as alternative ways for lenders to sell to the GSEs loans with loan-to-value ratios greater than 80%. These investor-paid mortgage insurance programs, in which insurance is acquired directly by each GSE, have many of the same features and represent an alternative to traditional private mortgage insurance products that are provided to individual lenders. Participants in IMAGIN and EPMI are not subject to compliance with the current PMIERs, which may create a competitive disadvantage for private mortgage insurers if these pilot programs are expanded. To the extent these credit risk products evolve in a manner that displaces primary mortgage insurance coverage, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced. It is difficult to predict the impact of alternative credit risk transfer products, if any, that are developed to meet the goals established by the FHFA.\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae also possess substantial market power, which enables them to influence our U.S. mortgage insurance business and the mortgage insurance industry in general. Although we actively monitor and develop our relationships with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, a deterioration in any of these relationships, or the loss of business or opportunities for new business, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn furtherance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s respective charter requirements as noted above, each GSE adopted PMIERs effective December 31, 2015. The PMIERs include financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer\u2019s \u201cAvailable Assets\u201d (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed \u201cMinimum Required Assets\u201d (which are based on an insurer\u2019s risk-in-force and are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount) and otherwise generally establish when a mortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the respective GSE for acquisition of high loan-to-value mortgages. The GSEs may amend or waive PMIERs at their discretion, and also have broad discretion to interpret PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of our available assets and/or minimum required assets.\nThe amount of capital that may be required in the future to maintain the Minimum Required Assets, as defined in the current PMIERs, and operate our business is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the way PMIERs are applied and interpreted by the GSEs and FHFA as and after they are implemented; (ii) the future performance of the U.S. housing market; (iii) our generation of earnings in our U.S. mortgage insurance business, available assets and risk-based required assets, reducing risk in-force and reducing delinquencies as anticipated, and writing anticipated amounts and types of new U.S. mortgage insurance business; and (iv) our overall financial performance, capital and liquidity levels. Depending on our actual experience, the amount of capital required under PMIERs for our U.S. mortgage insurance business may be higher than currently anticipated. In the absence of a premium increase, if we hold more capital relative to insured loans, our returns will be lower. We may be unable to increase premium rates for various reasons, principally due to competition. Our inability, on the other hand, to increase the capital as required in the anticipated timeframes and on the anticipated terms, and to realize the anticipated benefits, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. More particularly, our ability to continue to meet the PMIERs financial requirements and maintain a prudent amount of capital in excess of those requirements, given the dynamic nature of asset\nvaluations\nand requirement\nchanges\nover time, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to complete reinsurance transactions on our anticipated terms and timetable, which are subject to market conditions, third-party approvals and other actions (including approval by regulators and the GSEs), and other factors which are outside of our control; and (ii) our ability to contribute holding company cash or other sources of capital to satisfy the portion of the financial requirements that are not satisfied through reinsurance transactions. In addition, another potential capital source includes, but is not limited to, the issuance of securities by Genworth Financial or Genworth Holdings, which could materially adversely impact our business, shareholders and debtholders.\nOur assessment of PMIERs compliance is based on a number of factors, including affiliate asset valuations under PMIERs and our understanding of the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the PMIERs financial requirements. Although we believe we have sufficient capital in our U.S. mortgage insurance business as required under PMIERs and we remain an approved insurer, there can be no assurance these conditions will continue. In addition, there can be no assurance we will continue to meet the conditions contained in the GSE letters granting PMIERs credit for reinsurance including, but not limited to, our ability to remain below a statutory risk-to-capital ratio of 18:1. The GSEs also reserve the right to reevaluate the credit for reinsurance available under PMIERs. If we are unable to continue to meet PMIERs requirements as interpreted or amended by the GSEs we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, compliance with PMIERs requires us to seek the GSEs\u2019 prior approval before taking many actions, including implementing certain new products or services or entering into inter-company agreements among others. PMIERs\u2019 prior approval requirements could prohibit, materially modify or delay us in our intended course of action. Further, the GSEs may modify or change their interpretation of terms they require us to include in our mortgage insurance coverage for loans purchased by them, requiring us to modify our terms of coverage or operational procedures to remain an approved insurer, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results. It is possible the GSEs could, at their own discretion, require additional limitations and/or conditions on certain of our activities and practices that are not currently in the PMIERs in order for us to remain an approved insurer. Additional requirements or conditions imposed by the GSEs could limit our operating flexibility and the areas in which we may write new business.\nOur U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum statutory capital requirements, which if not met or waived, would result in restrictions or prohibitions on our doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCertain states have insurance laws or regulations which require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its level of risk in-force. While formulations of minimum capital vary in certain states, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted risk-to-capital ratio of 25:1. If one of our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries that is writing business in a particular state fails to maintain that\nstate\u2019s required minimum capital level, we would generally be required to immediately stop writing new business in the state until the insurer re-establishes the required level of capital or receives a waiver of the requirement from the state\u2019s insurance regulator, or until we establish an alternative source of underwriting capacity acceptable to the regulator. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, GMICO\u2019s risk-to-capital ratio was approximately 12.5:1. While it is our expectation that our U.S. mortgage insurance business will continue to meet its regulatory capital requirements, should GMICO in the future exceed required risk-to-capital levels, we would seek required regulatory and GSE forbearance and approvals or seek approval for the utilization of alternative insurance vehicles. However, there can be no assurance if, and on what terms, such forbearance and approvals may be obtained.\nThe NAIC established the MGIWG to determine and make recommendations to the NAIC\u2019s Financial Condition Committee as to what, if any, changes to make to the solvency and other regulations relating to mortgage guaranty insurers. The MGIWG continues to work on revisions to the MGI Model. The proposed amendments of the MGI Model relate to, among other things: (i) capital and reserve standards, including increased minimum capital and surplus requirements, mortgage guaranty-specific RBC standards, dividend restrictions and contingency and premium deficiency reserves; (ii) limitations on the geographic concentration of mortgage guaranty risk, including state-based limitations; (iii) restrictions on mortgage insurers\u2019 investments in notes secured by mortgages; (iv) prudent underwriting standards and formal underwriting guidelines to be approved by the insurer\u2019s board; (v) the establishment of formal, internal \u201cMortgage Guaranty Quality Control Programs\u201d with respect to in-force business; (vi) prohibitions on captive reinsurance arrangements; and (vii) incorporation of an NAIC \u201cMortgage Guaranty Insurance Standards Manual.\u201d The MGIWG is currently working on the development of the mortgage guaranty insurance capital model, which is needed to determine the RBC and loan-level capital standards for the amended MGI Model. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of this process, the effect changes, if any, will have on the mortgage guaranty insurance market generally, or on our businesses specifically, the additional costs associated with compliance with any such changes, or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We also cannot predict whether other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or what impact, if any, such initiatives, if adopted as laws, may have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in regulations that adversely affect the mortgage insurance markets in which we operate could affect our operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance.\nIn addition to the general regulatory risks that are described under \u201c-Our insurance businesses are extensively regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth,\u201d we are also affected by various additional regulations relating particularly to our mortgage insurance operations.\nUnited States\nIn the United States, federal and state regulations affect the scope of our U.S. competitors\u2019 operations, which has an effect on the size of the U.S. mortgage insurance market and the intensity of the competition in our U.S. mortgage insurance business. This competition includes not only other private mortgage insurers, but also U.S. federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA, which are governed by federal regulations. Increases in the maximum loan amount that the FHA can insure, and reductions in the mortgage insurance premiums the FHA charges, can reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance. Decreases in the maximum loan amounts the GSEs will purchase or guarantee, increases in GSE fees or decreases in the maximum loan-to-value ratio for loans the GSEs will purchase can also reduce demand for private mortgage insurance. Legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could cause demand for private mortgage insurance to decrease. In addition, there is uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Basel framework and whether its rules will be implemented in the United States. It is possible that its implementation could occur in the United States and its rules could discourage the use of mortgage insurance. See \u201c-Basel Framework\u201d below for further details.\nOur U.S. mortgage insurance business, as a credit enhancement provider in the residential mortgage lending industry, is also subject to compliance with various federal and state consumer protection and insurance laws, including RESPA, the ECOA, the FHA, the Homeowners Protection Act, the FCRA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and others. Among other things, these laws prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, providing services to lenders for no or reduced fees or payments for services not actually performed, require fairness and non-discrimination in granting or facilitating the granting of credit, require cancellation of insurance and refund of unearned premiums under certain circumstances, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, and define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities. Changes in these laws or regulations, changes in the appropriate regulator\u2019s interpretation of these laws or regulations or heightened enforcement activity could materially adversely affect the operations and profitability of our U.S. mortgage insurance business.\nAustralia\nIn Australia, APRA regulates all ADIs and life, general and mortgage insurance companies. APRA also determines the minimum regulatory capital requirements for ADIs. APRA\u2019s current regulations provide for reduced capital requirements for certain ADIs that insure residential mortgages with an \u201cacceptable\u201d mortgage insurer (which include our Australian mortgage insurance companies) for all non-standard mortgages and for standard mortgages with loan-to-value ratios above 80%. APRA\u2019s regulations currently set out a number of circumstances in which a loan may be considered to be non-standard from an ADI\u2019s perspective. The capital levels for Australian IRB ADIs are determined by their APRA-approved IRB models, which may or may not allocate capital credit for LMI. APRA and the IRB ADIs have not yet finalized internal models for residential mortgage risk and we do not believe that the IRB ADIs currently benefit from an explicit reduction in their capital requirements for mortgages covered by mortgage insurance.\nUnder APRA rules, ADIs in Australia that are accredited as standardized, receive a reduced capital incentive for using mortgage insurance for high loan-to-value mortgage loans in Australia. ADIs that are considered to be advanced accredited and determine their own capital estimates, are currently working with the mortgage insurers and APRA to determine the appropriate level of incentive mortgage insurance to provide for high loan-to-value mortgage loans. The rules also provide that ADIs would be able to acquire mortgage insurance covering less of the exposure to the loan than existing requirements with reduced capital incentives. Accordingly, lenders in Australia may be able to reduce their use of mortgage insurance for high loan-to-value ratio mortgages or limit their use to the higher risk portions of their portfolios, which may have an adverse effect on our mortgage insurance business in Australia.\nUncertainty remains surrounding the implementation of the Basel framework. Final changes to the banking capital framework meant to address the Basel framework are expected to be announced by APRA in the first half of 2020 and finalized in the second half of 2020, with an effective date of January 1, 2022. It is too early to determine the ultimate impact these regulatory changes will have on our mortgage insurance business in Australia, but it is possible that its rules could discourage the use of mortgage insurance.\nBasel Framework\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published the finalization of the post-crisis reforms to the Basel framework. Among other issues, the Basel Committee addressed variability in risk-weighted assets, including residential real estate. Currently national supervisors are considering how to implement these reforms. Because these reforms are not yet implemented by national supervisors, we cannot predict the mortgage insurance benefits, if any, that ultimately will be provided to lenders, or how any such benefits may affect the opportunities for the growth of mortgage insurance. If countries implement the Basel framework in a manner that does not reward lenders for using mortgage insurance on high loan-to-value mortgage loans, or if lenders conclude that mortgage insurance does not provide sufficient capital incentives, then we may have to revise our product offerings to meet the new requirements and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to mitigate the impact of Regulations XXX or AXXX and, therefore, we may incur higher operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have increased term and universal life insurance statutory reserves in response to Regulations XXX and AXXX and have taken steps to mitigate the impact these regulations have had on our business, including increasing premium rates and implementing reserve funding structures. One way that we and other insurance companies have mitigated the impact of these regulations is through captive reinsurance companies and/or special purpose vehicles. If we were to discontinue our use of captive life reinsurance subsidiaries to finance statutory reserves in response to regulatory changes on a prospective basis, the reasonably likely impact would be increased costs related to alternative financing, such as third-party reinsurance, which would adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we cannot be certain that affordable alternative financing would be available.\nOn March 7, 2016, we suspended sales of our traditional life insurance products. While we are no longer writing new life insurance business, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impacts of Regulations XXX or AXXX on our in-force term and universal life insurance products which are not currently part of reserve funding structures or which may be part of existing reserve arrangements and need refinancing.\nAdditionally, there may be future regulatory, tax or other impacts to existing reserve funding structures and/or future refinancing, which could require us to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. For example, effective January 1, 2017, the NAIC adopted an amended version of AG 48, which was subsequently codified in the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation. This regulation becomes effective when formally adopted by the states, however, it is not clear what additional changes or state variations may emerge as the states begin to adopt this regulation. As a result, there is the potential for additional requirements making it more difficult and/or expensive for us to mitigate the impact of Regulations XXX and AXXX. To date, four states have implemented the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation, including Virginia, which is the state regulator for GLAIC, one of our principal life insurance subsidiaries.\nChanges in accounting and reporting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies and insurance regulators could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting and reporting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the required adoption of future accounting and reporting standards may result in significant costs to implement. For example, new accounting guidance (that is not yet effective for us) related to long-duration insurance contracts and financial instruments will likely materially impact our financial position and could result in increased volatility in our results of operations, as well as other comprehensive income (loss). In addition, the implementation of these or other proposals could require us to make significant changes to systems and use additional resources, resulting in significant incremental costs to implement the proposals. See note 2 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details.\nLiquidity, Financial Strength and Credit Ratings, and Counterparty and Credit Risks\nOur internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs and our access to capital may be limited or unavailable. Under such conditions, we may seek additional capital but may be unable to obtain it.\nWe need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt, maturing debt obligations and to meet any statutory capital requirements of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, Genworth Holdings had approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding debt that matures between 2020 and 2066, including $0.4 billion and $0.7 billion that matures in February 2021 and September 2021, respectively. Debt with a principal balance of $397 million, that was originally scheduled to mature in June 2020, was early redeemed in January 2020. In addition, Genworth Holdings has an intercompany note due to GLIC on March 31, 2020 with a principal amount of $200 million.\nOur existing cash resources are not sufficient to repay all outstanding debt as it becomes due, and therefore we will be required to rely on a combination of other potential liquidity sources to repay or refinance debt as it becomes due, including existing and future cash resources, new borrowings, and/or other potential sources of liquidity such as asset sales or issuing additional equity. Market conditions and a variety of other factors may make it difficult or impracticable to generate additional liquidity on favorable terms or at all. Any failure to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the absence of the transaction with China Oceanwide, we may need to pursue additional strategic asset sales, similar to the sale of Genworth Canada, to improve our financial stability and address our future debt maturities. Strategic asset sales could include transactions with respect to our U.S. mortgage insurance business and/or our mortgage insurance business in Australia. The availability of additional funding will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, the level of activity and availability of reinsurance, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the performance of and outlook for our business. In addition, even if we are successful with additional strategic asset sales or other transactions, we could have potential adverse actions taken against us, including litigation.\nWe may not be able to raise borrowings on favorable terms or at all, based on our credit ratings and financial condition. There is no guarantee that any of these factors will improve in the future when we would seek additional borrowings. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and downgrades in our credit ratings may force us to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than would be optimal, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price.\nWe do not currently have a revolving credit facility at the Genworth Holdings level to provide liquidity. To the extent we need additional funding to satisfy our additional liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new credit facility on terms (or at targeted amounts) acceptable to us or at all.\nSimilarly, market conditions and a variety of other factors may make it difficult or impracticable to generate additional liquidity through asset sales or the issuance of additional equity, and any issuance of equity in such circumstances could be highly dilutive to our stockholders.\nFor a further discussion of our liquidity, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nAs holding companies, we and Genworth Holdings depend on the ability of our respective subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to each of us and to meet our obligations.\nWe and Genworth Holdings each act as a holding company for our respective subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of our own. Dividends from our respective subsidiaries, permitted payments to us under tax sharing and expense reimbursement arrangements with our subsidiaries and proceeds from borrowings are our principal sources of cash to meet our obligations. These obligations include operating expenses, interest and principal payments on current and future borrowings, and it might include further cash payments due under court order. See note 21 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details regarding asserted claims. If the cash we receive from our respective subsidiaries pursuant to dividends and tax sharing and expense reimbursement arrangements is insufficient to fund any of these obligations, or if a subsidiary is unable or unwilling for any reason to pay dividends to either of us, we or Genworth Holdings may be required to raise cash through, among other things, the incurrence of debt (including convertible or exchangeable debt), the sale of assets or the issuance of equity.\nThe payment of dividends and other distributions by our insurance subsidiaries is dependent on, among other things, the performance of the subsidiaries, corporate law restrictions, and insurance laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \u201cextraordinary\u201d and require insurance regulatory approval. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by the insurance subsidiaries (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services) if they determine that such payment could be adverse to policyholders or contractholders. Moreover, regulators that have governance over our Australian mortgage insurance subsidiaries may impose additional restrictions over such subsidiaries using the broad prudential authorities available to them. Courts typically grant regulators significant deference when considering challenges of an insurance company to a determination by insurance regulators to grant or withhold approvals with respect to dividends and other distributions.\nOur liquidity and capital positions are highly dependent on the performance of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to us as anticipated. Given the performance of our U.S. life insurance businesses, dividends will not be paid by these businesses for the foreseeable future. The evaluation of future dividend sources, including determining which businesses will provide such dividends, and our overall liquidity plans are subject to current and future market conditions, among other factors, which are subject to change.\nIn addition, as a public company that is traded on the ASX, Genworth Australia and its subsidiaries are subject to Australian securities laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the ASX. These applicable laws, regulations and rules include but are not limited to, obligations and procedures in respect of the equal and fair treatment of all shareholders of Genworth Australia. Although the board of directors of Genworth Australia is currently composed of a majority of Genworth designated directors, under Australian law each director has an obligation to exercise their powers and discharge their duties in good faith in the best interests of Genworth Australia and for a proper purpose. Accordingly, actions taken by Genworth Australia and its board of directors (including the payment of dividends to us) are subject to, and may be limited by, the laws, rules and regulations of the entity.\nAdverse rating agency actions have resulted in a loss of business and adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition and business and future adverse rating actions could have a further and more significant adverse impact on us.\nFinancial strength ratings, which various rating agencies publish as measures of an insurance company\u2019s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in our products, the ability to market our products and our competitive position. Credit ratings, which rating agencies publish as measures of an entity\u2019s ability to repay its indebtedness, are important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and other forms of credit and to the cost of such financing.\nOver the last several years, the ratings of our holding companies and all of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries, have been downgraded, placed on negative outlook and/or put on review for potential downgrade on various occasions. A ratings downgrade, negative outlook or review could occur (and has occurred) for a variety of reasons, including reasons specifically related to our company, generally related to our industry or the broader financial services industry or as a result of changes by the rating agencies in their methodologies or rating criteria. We may be at risk of additional ratings downgrades in the future. A negative outlook on our ratings or a downgrade in any of our financial strength or credit ratings, the announcement of a potential downgrade, negative outlook or review, or customer, investor, regulator or other concerns about the possibility of a downgrade, negative outlook or review, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nSee \u201cItem 1 - Business-Ratings\u201d for information regarding the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries.\nThe direct or indirect effects of such adverse ratings actions or any future actions could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 ceasing and/or reducing new sales of our products or limiting the business opportunities we are presented with;\n\u2022 adversely affecting our relationships with distributors, including the loss of exclusivity under certain agreements with our independent sales intermediaries and distribution partners;\n\u2022 causing us to lose key distributors that have ratings requirements that we may no longer satisfy (or resulting in our renegotiation of new, less favorable arrangements with those distributors);\n\u2022 requiring us to modify some of our existing products or services to remain competitive, or introduce new products or services;\n\u2022 materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans by contractholders and policyholders;\n\u2022 requiring us to post additional collateral for our derivatives or hedging agreements tied to the ratings of our holding companies;\n\u2022 requiring us to provide support, or to arrange for third-party support, in the form of collateral, capital contributions or letters of credit under the terms of certain of our reinsurance, securitization and other agreements, or otherwise securing our commercial counterparties for the perceived risk of our financial strength;\n\u2022 adversely affecting our ability to maintain reinsurance or obtain new reinsurance or obtain it on reasonable pricing and other terms;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to enter into new derivative transactions thereby increasing additional asset adequacy or other statutory reserves and lowering statutory capital, reducing our financial flexibility;\n\u2022 increasing the capital charge associated with affiliated investments within certain of our U.S. life insurance businesses thereby lowering capital and RBC of these subsidiaries and negatively impacting our financial flexibility;\n\u2022 regulators requiring certain of our subsidiaries to maintain additional capital, limiting thereby our financial flexibility and requiring us to raise additional capital;\n\u2022 adversely affecting our ability to raise capital;\n\u2022 increasing our cost of borrowing and making it more difficult to borrow in the public debt markets or enter into a credit agreement; and\n\u2022 making it more difficult to execute strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges.\nUnder PMIERs, the GSEs have substantially revised their eligibility requirements and no longer primarily base such requirements on maintenance of specific ratings levels. In lieu of ratings criteria, the GSEs, under PMIERs, have adopted new financial requirements. See \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d for additional information regarding the requirements under PMIERs. However, under PMIERs, the GSEs now require maintenance of at least one rating with a rating agency acceptable to the respective GSEs. Ratings downgrades that result in our inability to insure new mortgage loans sold to the GSEs, or the transfer by the GSEs of our existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer, would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, our relationships with our mortgage insurance customers may be adversely affected by the ratings assigned to our holding company or other operating subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDefaults by counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks, or defaults by us on agreements we have with these counterparties, may expose us to risks we sought to mitigate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe routinely execute reinsurance and derivative transactions with reinsurers, brokers/dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients to mitigate our risks in various circumstances and to hedge various business risks. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client or change in collateral value. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. We cannot be sure that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us now or in the future or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Collateral is often posted by the counterparty to offset this risk, however, we bear the risk that the collateral declines in value or otherwise is inadequate to fully compensate us in the event of a default. We also enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, swaps, forwards, and interest rate and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, and collateral posted, if any, is inadequate, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. In addition, if we trigger downgrade provisions on risk-hedging or reinsurance arrangements, the counterparties to these arrangements may be able to terminate our arrangements with them or require us to take other measures, such as post additional collateral, contribute capital or provide letters of credit. We have agreed to new terms with almost all of our counterparties concerning our collateral arrangements given our ratings decline. In most cases, we have agreed to post excess collateral to maintain our existing derivative agreements. Beginning in 2018, we renegotiated with many of our counterparties to remove the credit downgrade provisions from the master swap agreements entirely or replace them with a provision that allows the counterparty to terminate the derivative transaction if the RBC ratio of the applicable insurance company goes below a certain threshold. In 2019, we successfully completed these negotiations and as a result, none of our insurance company master swap agreements have credit downgrade provisions. Although we believe this has allowed us to maintain effective hedging relationships with our counterparties, it has added additional strain on liquidity and collateral sufficiency. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we can maintain these current arrangements in the foreseeable future or at all. If counterparties exercise their rights to terminate transactions, we may be required to make cash payments to the counterparty based on the current contract value, which would hinder our ability to manage future risks.\nWe ceded to UFLIC our in-force structured settlements block of business issued prior to 2004, certain variable annuity business issued prior to 2004 and the long-term care insurance\nbusiness\nassumed from legal entities now a part of Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. UFLIC has established trust accounts for our benefit\nto secure its obligations\nunder the reinsurance arrangements. GE is obligated to maintain UFLIC\u2019s RBC above a specified minimum level pursuant to a Capital Maintenance Agreement. If UFLIC becomes insolvent notwithstanding this agreement, and the amounts in the trust accounts are insufficient to pay UFLIC\u2019s obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The loss of material risk-hedging or reinsurance arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDefaults or other events impacting the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our income.\nWe are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal or interest payments they owe us. As of December 31, 2019, fixed maturity securities of $60.3 billion in our investment portfolio represented 81% of our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets. Events reducing the value of our investment portfolio other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Levels of write-downs or impairments are impacted by our assessment of the financial condition of the issuer, whether or not the issuer is expected to pay its principal and interest obligations, our expected recoveries in the event of a default or circumstances that would require us to sell securities which have declined in value.\nOperational Risks\nIf we are unable to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees or senior management, our results of operations, financial condition and business operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur success is largely dependent on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees and senior management. We face intense competition in our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability, including actuarial, finance, legal, investment, risk, compliance and other professionals. Our ability to retain, attract and motivate experienced and qualified employees and senior management has been more challenging in light of our financial difficulties, past announcements concerning expense reductions, as well as the demands being placed on our employees. In addition, our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees may be adversely impacted by our proposed transaction with China Oceanwide, including from repeated delays in closing the transaction and the ensuing uncertainty. We cannot be sure we will be able to attract, retain and motivate the desired workforce, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and business operations. In addition, we may not be able to meet regulatory requirements relating to required expertise in various professional positions.\nManaging key employee succession and retention is also critical to our success. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans, including retention programs, designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.\nOur risk management programs may not be effective in identifying or adequate in controlling or mitigating the risks we face.\nWe have developed risk management programs that include risk appetite, limits, identification, quantification, governance, policies and procedures and seek to appropriately identify, monitor, measure, control, mitigate and report the types of risks to which we are subject. We regularly review our risk management programs and work to update them on an ongoing basis to be consistent with evolving global market practices. However, our risk management programs may not fully control or mitigate all of the risks we face in our business or anticipate all potential material negative events.\nMany of our methods for managing certain financial risks (e.g. credit, market, insurance and underwriting risks) are based on observed historical market behaviors and/or historical, statistically-based models. Historical measures may not accurately predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical measures have indicated. We have also established internal risk limits based upon these historical, statistically-based models and we monitor compliance with these limits. Our internal risk limits may be insufficient and our monitoring may not detect all violations (inadvertent or otherwise) of these limits. Other risk management methods are based on our evaluation of information regarding markets, customers and customer behavior, macroeconomic and environmental conditions, catastrophic occurrences and potential changing paradigms that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This collective information may not always be accurate, complete, up to date or properly considered, interpreted or evaluated in our analyses. Moreover, the models and other parts of our risk management programs we rely on in managing various aspects of our business may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons, including as a result of issues arising in the construction, implementation, interpretation or use of the models or other programs, the use of inaccurate assumptions or use of short-term financial metrics that do not reveal long-term trends. The limitations of our models and other parts of our risk management programs may be material, and could lead us to make wrong or sub-optimal decisions in managing our risk and other aspects of our business and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nManagement of operational, legal, franchise and global regulatory risks requires, among other things, methods to appropriately identify all such key risks, systems to record incidents and policies and procedures designed to detect, record and address all such risks and occurrences. Management of technology risks requires methods to ensure our systems, processes and people are maintaining the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our information, ensuring technology is enabling our overall strategy, and our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify, measure and control our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe employ various strategies, including hedging and reinsurance, to mitigate financial risks inherent in our business and operations. These risks include current or future changes in the fair value of our assets and liabilities, current or future changes in cash flows, the effect of interest rates, changes in equity markets, credit spread movements, the occurrence of credit and counterparty defaults, currency fluctuations, changes in global housing prices, and changes in mortality, morbidity and lapses. We seek to control these risks by, among other things, entering into reinsurance contracts and derivative instruments. Such contracts and instruments may not always be available to us and subject us to counterparty credit risk. Developing effective strategies for dealing with these risks is a complex process, and no strategy can fully insulate us from such risks. The execution of these strategies also introduces operational risks and considerations. See \u201c-Reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses\u201d and \u201c-Defaults by counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks, or defaults by us on agreements we have with these counterparties, may expose us to risks we sought to mitigate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition\u201d for more information about risks inherent in our reinsurance and hedging strategies.\nWe may choose to retain certain levels of financial and/or non-financial risk, even when it is possible to mitigate these risks. The decision to retain certain levels of financial risk is predicated on our belief that the expected future returns that we will realize from retaining the risk, in relation to the level of risk retained, is favorable, but it may turn out that our expectations are incorrect and we incur material costs or suffer other adverse consequences that arise from the retained risk.\nOur performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from day-to-day business activities, including underwriting, claims processing, policy administration and servicing, execution of our investment and hedging strategy, actuarial estimates and calculations, financial and tax reporting and other activities, many of which are very complex. We seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of\nor related to these activities through a variety of internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. However, the occurrence of unforeseen events, or the occurrence of events of a greater magnitude than expected, including those arising from inadequate or ineffective controls, a failure in processes, procedures or systems implemented by us or a failure on the part of employees upon which we rely in this regard, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPast or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors or suppliers could result in violations of laws by us, regulatory sanctions against us and/or serious reputational, legal or financial harm to our business, and the precautions we employ to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor the business decisions and activities of these individuals to prevent us from engaging in inappropriate activities, excessive risk taking, fraud or security breaches, these individuals may take such risks regardless of such controls and procedures and such controls and procedures may fail to detect all such decisions and activities. Our compensation policies and procedures are reviewed by us as part of our overall risk management program, but it is possible that such compensation policies and practices could inadvertently incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk taking. If these individuals take excessive or inappropriate risks, those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reliance on key customer or distribution relationships could cause us to lose significant sales if one or more of those relationships terminate or are reduced.\nOur businesses depend on our relationships with our customers, and in particular, our relationships with our largest lending customers in our mortgage insurance businesses. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans that they originate and they also do business with us indirectly, primarily in the United States, through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they do with us directly and also their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. Particularly in Australia where a large portion of our business is concentrated with a small number of customers, the loss of business from significant customers has had and could in the future have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write and consequently, our financial condition and results of operations. Maintaining our business relationships and business volumes with our largest lending customers remains critical to the success of our business.\nWe cannot be certain that any loss of business from significant customers, or any single lender, would be replaced by other customers, existing or new. As a result of current market conditions and increased regulatory requirements, our lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer\u2019s pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength, ratings or other factors.\nAs discussed in \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business,\u201d our mortgage insurance business in Australia is highly concentrated in a small number of key distribution partners, which increases our risks and exposure in the event one or more of these partners terminate or reduce their relationship with us. Any termination, reduction or material change in relationship with a key distribution partner could have a material adverse effect on our future sales for one or more products. In addition, mortgage insurance in Australia is not required on high loan-to-value loans; some lenders self-insure a portion of their originations. If our lending customers in this market increase the self-insurance or other alternatives to mortgage insurance, this could have an unfavorable impact on the amount of new business we are able to write and consequently, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution methods, including through relationships with key distribution partners (including lender customers of our mortgage insurance businesses). These distribution partners are an integral part of our business model. We are at risk that key distribution partners may merge, change their distribution model affecting how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts or relationships with us. In addition, timing of key distributor adoption of our new product offerings\nmay impact sales of those products. Some distributors have, and in the future others may, elect to terminate or reduce their distribution relationships with us for a variety of reasons, such as the result of our recent financial challenges (including adverse ratings actions). Likewise, in the future, other distributors may terminate or reduce their relationships with us as a result of, among other things, these challenges as well as future adverse developments in our business or adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks, commission levels or the breadth of our product offerings.\nCompetitors could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.\nOur businesses are subject to intense competition. We believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features, product investment returns, price, commission structure, marketing and distribution arrangements, brand, reputation, financial strength ratings and service. In many of our product lines, we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do. Our financial challenges have adversely and directly impacted the competitiveness of our life, annuity and long-term care insurance businesses, and indirectly adversely impacted our mortgage insurance businesses. In addition, many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels. The appointment of a receiver to rehabilitate or liquidate or take other adverse regulatory actions against a significant competitor could also negatively impact our businesses if such actions were to impact consumer confidence in industry products and services.\nThe U.S. private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are price, reputation, customer relationships, financial strength ratings and service.\nThere are currently six active U.S. mortgage insurers, including us. Competition on price remains highly competitive. We monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to balance both profitability and market share considerations in developing our pricing strategies. We have reduced certain of our rates, which will reduce and has reduced our premium yield (net premiums earned divided by the average insurance in-force) over time as older mortgage insurance coverage with higher premium rates run off and new mortgage insurance coverage with lower premium rates are written.\nBy mid-2019, all U.S. mortgage insurers were offering proprietary risk-based pricing plans. As opposed to traditional rate card pricing, mortgage insurance premium rates in these risk-based pricing models are visible only to lenders and cannot be seen by competitors. U.S. mortgage insurance companies may view this lack of transparency as a means to gain market share by lowering price. Lack of pricing transparency could cause other U.S. mortgage insurance companies to respond in an outsized manner and cause further lowering of premiums. However, these pricing models also allow U.S. mortgage insurers to price risk more effectively and provide the ability to manage the credit risk and geographic makeup of their new insurance written.\nIn addition, not all of our U.S. mortgage insurance products have the same return on capital profile. Single premium insurance coverage, for instance, has been priced in the market at levels that currently generate lower lifetime premiums and require higher lifetime capital than monthly premium products. To the extent that some of our competitors are willing to set lower pricing and accept lower returns than we find acceptable, we may lose business opportunities, and this may affect our overall business relationship with certain customers. If we match lower pricing on these products, we will experience a similar reduction in returns on capital. Depending upon the degree to which we undertake or match such pricing practices, there may be a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOne or more of our competitors may seek to capture increased market share by reducing pricing, offering alternative coverage and product options, loosening their underwriting guidelines or relaxing risk management policies, which could, in turn, improve their competitive positions in the industry and negatively impact our\nability to achieve our business goals. Competition within the U.S. mortgage insurance industry could result in a loss of customers, lower premiums, riskier credit guidelines and other changes that could lower our revenues or increase our expenses. If we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors and attract and retain our target customers, the revenue of our U.S. mortgage insurance business may be adversely impacted, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.\nWe compete with government-owned and government-sponsored enterprises in our mortgage insurance businesses, and this may put us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing and other terms and conditions.\nOur U.S. mortgage insurance business competes with the FHA and the VA, as well as certain local- and state-level housing finance agencies. Separately, the government-owned and government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, compete with our U.S. mortgage insurance business through certain of their risk-sharing insurance programs. Those competitors may establish pricing terms and business practices that may be influenced by motives such as advancing social housing policy or stabilizing the mortgage lending industry, which may not be consistent with maximizing return on capital or other profitability measures. In addition, those governmental enterprises typically do not have the same capital requirements that we and other mortgage insurance companies have and therefore may have financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In the event that a government-owned or sponsored entity in one of our markets determines to change prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit or risk management motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Australia mortgage insurance business competes with government-owned and government-sponsored funded programs and enterprises, in addition to lender captives and direct mortgage insurer competitors. These competitors may establish pricing terms and business practices that may be influenced by motives such as advancing social housing policy or stabilizing the mortgage lending industry, which may not be consistent with maximizing return on capital or other profitability measures. In the event that a government-owned or sponsored program or entity in one of our markets determines to reduce prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted from deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, such as we have reported in the past, or any other failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures could result in material errors in our financial statements or untimely filings, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, that would result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nOur computer systems may fail or be compromised, and unanticipated problems could materially adversely impact our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans, which could damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business effectively and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems. We also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third-party service providers through which we share and\nreceive information. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions, including processing claims and applications, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records. Despite the implementation of security and back-up measures, our computer systems and those of our partners and third-party service providers have been and may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptive problems. The failure of these systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTechnology continues to expand and plays an ever increasing role in our business. While it is our goal to safeguard information assets from physical theft and cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance that our information security will detect and protect information assets from these ever increasing risks. Information assets include both information itself in the form of computer data, written materials, knowledge and supporting processes, and the information technology systems, networks, other electronic devices and storage media used to store, process, retrieve and transmit that information. As more information is used and shared by our employees, customers and suppliers, both within and outside our company, cybersecurity threats become expansive in nature. Confidentiality, integrity and availability of information are essential to maintaining our reputation, legal position and ability to conduct our operations. Although we have implemented controls and continue to train our employees, a cybersecurity event could still occur which would cause damage to our reputation with our customers, distributors and other stakeholders and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe retain confidential information in our computer systems, and we rely on commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems, including computers or mobile devices. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems or misuse authorized access could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete any information in the systems, including personally identifiable information, personal health information and proprietary business information. Our employees, distribution partners and other vendors use portable computers or mobile devices which may contain similar information to that in our computer systems, and these devices have been and can be lost, stolen or damaged, and therefore subject to the same risks as our other computer systems. In addition, an increasing number of states and foreign countries require that affected parties be notified or other actions be taken (which could involve significant costs to us) if a security breach results in the inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable information. We have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, although to date none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. Any compromise of the security of our computer systems or those of our partners and third-party service providers that results in inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.\nThe area of cybersecurity has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, with various countries, government agencies and insurance regulators introducing and/or passing legislation in an attempt to safeguard personal information from the escalating cybersecurity treats. For additional details, see \u201cItem 1. Business-\nRegulation-\nOther Laws and Regulations-\nCybersecurity.\u201d\nIn addition, unanticipated problems with, or failures of, our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy, lose or otherwise compromise valuable data. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. The failure of our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans could adversely impact our profitability and our business.\nInsurance and Product-Related Risks\nOur financial condition, results of operations, long-term care insurance products and/or our reputation in the market may be adversely affected if we are unable to implement premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our in-force long-term care insurance policies by enough or quickly enough; and the premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions currently being implemented, as well as any future in-force rate actions, may lower product demand.\nThe continued viability of our long-term care insurance business, as well as that of GLIC and GLICNY, is based on our ability to obtain significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our in-force long-term care insurance products, as warranted and actuarially justified. The adequacy of our current long-term care insurance reserves also depends significantly on certain assumptions regarding our ability to successfully execute our in-force management rate action plan through premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. We include assumptions for future in-force rate actions, which includes assumptions for significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions that have been approved or are anticipated to be approved (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed), in our determination of loss recognition testing of our long-term care insurance reserves under U.S. GAAP and asset adequacy testing of our statutory long-term care insurance reserves.\nAlthough the terms of our long-term care insurance policies permit us to increase premiums under certain circumstances during the premium-paying period, these increases generally require regulatory approval, which can often take a long time to obtain and may not be obtained in all relevant jurisdictions or for the full amounts requested. In addition, some states are considering adopting long-term care insurance rate increase legislation that would further limit increases in long-term care insurance premium rates beyond the rate stability legislation previously adopted in certain states, which would adversely impact our ability to achieve anticipated rate increases. Some states have refused to approve actuarially justified rate actions and as of December 31, 2019, we were in litigation with one state that has refused to approve actuarially justified rate increases.\nWe will not be able to realize our future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions in the future if we cannot obtain the required regulatory approvals. In this event, we would have to increase our long-term care insurance reserves by amounts that would likely be material and would result in a material adverse impact. Moreover, we may not be able to sufficiently mitigate the impact of unexpected adverse experience through premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. Given our recent operating performance in our long-term care insurance business and the ongoing pressure to earnings from higher incurred claims, absent the future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions, our results of operations, capital levels, RBC and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the timing of our future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions takes longer to achieve than originally assumed, we would likely record higher reserves with no offsetting premiums and associated benefit reductions from in-force rate actions to mitigate the negative impact, which would likely result in an operating loss for our long-term care insurance business.\nRate increases by us or our competitors could also adversely affect our reputation in the markets in which we operate, adversely impact our ability to continue to market and sell new long-term care insurance products, make it more difficult for us to obtain future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions and adversely impact our ability to retain existing policyholders and agents. Policyholders may be unwilling or unable to pay the increased premium rates we will seek to charge. We cannot predict how our policyholders (or potential future policyholders), agents, competitors and regulators may react to any in-force rate increases, nor can we predict if regulators will approve requested in-force rate increases. We may also be forced to stop selling our long-term care insurance products in markets where we cannot achieve satisfactory in-force rate increases. For example, as of December 31, 2019, we have suspended sales in Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Montana, and will consider taking similar actions in the future in other states where we are unable to obtain satisfactory rate increases on in-force policies which could result in an adverse impact to our reputation.\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\nAs part of our overall risk and capital management strategy, we have historically purchased reinsurance from external reinsurers as well as provided internal reinsurance support for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. These reinsurance arrangements enable our businesses to transfer risks in exchange for some of the associated economic benefits and, as a result, improve our statutory capital position and manage risk to within our tolerance level. Some of these reinsurance arrangements are indefinite, but others require periodic renewals (such as reinsurance contracts in Australia). For these arrangements, at the end of the base term, we can elect a runoff term to continue coverage, with reducing amounts of regulatory capital benefits, or attempt to negotiate a renewal. The availability and cost of reinsurance protection are impacted by our operating and financial performance, including ratings, as well as conditions beyond our control. For example, our financial challenges and adverse rating actions may reduce the availability of certain types of reinsurance and make it more costly when it is available, as reinsurers are less willing to take on credit risk in a volatile market. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain new reinsurance or renew existing reinsurance arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, which could increase our risk and adversely affect our ability to write future business or obtain statutory capital credit for new reinsurance or could require us to make capital contributions to maintain regulatory capital requirements. See \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nA decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value home mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of mortgage insurance cancellations could result in a decline in our revenue in our mortgage insurance businesses.\nWe provide mortgage insurance primarily for high loan-to-value mortgages. Factors that could lead to a decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value mortgage originations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 an increase in the level of home mortgage interest rates and, in the United States, a reduction or loss of mortgage interest deductibility for federal income tax purposes;\n\u2022 implementation of more rigorous mortgage lending regulation, such as under APRA Prudential Practice Guides in Australia and Australia Securities and Investment Commission responsible lending guidance;\n\u2022 a decline in economic conditions generally, or in conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u2022 the level of consumer confidence, which may be adversely affected by economic instability, war or terrorist events;\n\u2022 an increase in the price of homes relative to income levels;\n\u2022 adverse population trends, including lower homeownership rates;\n\u2022 high rates of home price appreciation, which for refinancings affect whether refinanced loans have loan-to-value ratios that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022 changes in government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time home buyers.\nA decline in the volume of high loan-to-value mortgage originations would reduce the demand for mortgage insurance and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a significant percentage of the premiums we earn each year in our U.S. mortgage insurance business are renewal premiums from insurance policies written in previous years. We estimate that approximately 88% of our U.S. gross premiums earned in each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were renewal premiums. As a result, the length of time insurance remains in-force is an important\ndeterminant of our mortgage insurance revenues. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and many other mortgage investors in the United States generally permit a homeowner to ask the loan servicer to cancel the borrower\u2019s obligation to pay for mortgage insurance when the principal amount of the mortgage falls below 80% of the home\u2019s value. Factors that tend to reduce the length of time our mortgage insurance remains in-force include:\n\u2022 declining interest rates, which may result in the refinancing of the mortgages underlying our insurance policies with new mortgage loans that may not require mortgage insurance or that we do not insure;\n\u2022 significant appreciation in the value of homes, which causes the size of the mortgage to decrease below 80% of the value of the home and enables the borrower to request cancellation of the mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022 changes in mortgage insurance cancellation requirements under applicable federal law or mortgage insurance cancellation practices by mortgage lenders and investors.\nOur U.S. policy flow persistency rates were 78%, 84% and 82% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A decrease in persistency in the U.S. market generally would reduce the amount of our insurance in-force and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. However, higher persistency on certain products, especially A minus, Alt-A, ARMs and certain 100% loan-to-value loans, could have a material adverse effect if claims generated by such products remain elevated or increase.\nThe amount of mortgage insurance we write could decline significantly if alternatives to private mortgage insurance are used or lower coverage levels of mortgage insurance are selected.\nThere are a variety of alternatives to private mortgage insurance that may reduce the amount of mortgage insurance we write. These alternatives include:\n\u2022 originating mortgages in the United States that consist of two simultaneous loans, known as \u201csimultaneous seconds,\u201d comprising a first mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan, instead of a single mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of more than 80%;\n\u2022 using government mortgage insurance programs;\n\u2022 holding mortgages in the lenders\u2019 own loan portfolios and self-insuring;\n\u2022 using programs, such as those offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the United States, requiring lower mortgage insurance coverage levels;\n\u2022 originating and securitizing loans in mortgage-backed securities whose underlying mortgages are not insured with private mortgage insurance or which are structured so that the risk of default lies with the investor, rather than a private mortgage insurer; and\n\u2022 using risk-sharing insurance programs, credit default swaps or similar instruments, instead of private mortgage insurance, to transfer credit risk on mortgages.\nThe degree to which lenders or borrowers may select these alternatives now, or in the future, is difficult to predict. As one or more of the alternatives described above, or new alternatives that enter the market, are chosen over mortgage insurance, our revenues could be adversely impacted. The loss of business in general or the specific loss of more profitable business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPotential liabilities in connection with our U.S. contract underwriting services could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer contract underwriting services to certain of our mortgage lenders in the United States, pursuant to which our employees and contractors work directly with the lender to determine whether the data relating to a\nborrower and a proposed loan contained in a mortgage loan application file complies with the lender\u2019s loan underwriting guidelines or the investor\u2019s loan purchase requirements. In connection with that service, we also compile the application data and submit it to the automated underwriting systems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which independently analyze the data to determine if the proposed loan complies with their investor requirements.\nUnder the terms of our contract underwriting agreements, we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event that we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria, subject to contractual limitations on liability. As a result, we assume credit and processing risk in connection with our contract underwriting services. If our reserves for potential claims in connection with our contract underwriting services are inadequate as a result of differences from our estimates and assumptions or other reasons, we may be required to increase our underlying reserves, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMedical advances, such as genetic research and diagnostic imaging, and related legislation could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuity businesses.\nGenetic testing research and discovery is advancing at a rapid pace. Though some of this research is focused on identifying the genes associated with rare diseases, much of the research is focused on identifying the genes associated with an increased risk of various diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Diagnostic testing utilizing various blood panels or imaging techniques, including the use of artificial intelligence, may allow clinicians to detect similar diseases during an earlier treatment phase and prescribe more acute medicine. We believe that if an individual learns through such testing that they are predisposed to a condition that may reduce their life expectancy or increase their chances of requiring long-term care, they potentially will be more likely to purchase life and long-term care insurance policies or not permit their existing policy to lapse. In contrast, if an individual learns that they lack the genetic predisposition to develop the conditions that reduce longevity or require long-term care, they potentially will be less likely to purchase life and long-term care insurance products, but more likely to purchase certain annuity products and permit their life and long-term care insurance policies to lapse.\nBeing able to access and use the medical information (including the results of genetic and diagnostic testing) known to our prospective policyholders is important to ensure that an underwriting risk assessment matches the anticipated risk priced into our life and long-term care insurance products, as well as our annuity products. Currently, there are some state level restrictions related to an insurer\u2019s access and use of genetic information, and periodically new genetic testing legislation is being introduced. However, further restrictions on the access and use of such medical information could create a mismatch between an assessed risk and the product pricing. Such a mismatch has the potential to increase product pricing resulting in a decrease in sales and purchasers at increased risk becoming the more likely buyer. The net result of this could cause a deterioration in the risk profile of our portfolio which could lead to payments to our policyholders and contractholders that are materially higher than anticipated.\nIn addition to earlier diagnosis or knowledge of disease risk, medical advances may also lead to newer forms of preventive care which could improve an individual\u2019s overall health and/or longevity. If this were to occur, the duration of payments made by us under certain forms of long-term care insurance policies or our annuity contracts would likely increase thereby reducing our profitability on those products.\nOther Risks\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or a pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes, and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions and pandemics. For example, a natural or man-made disaster or a pandemic, such as coronavirus, could disrupt our computer systems and our ability to conduct or process business, as well as lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contractholders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations, such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies, deposits into our investment products, and mortgage payments on loans insured by our mortgage insurance policies. They could also significantly increase our mortality and morbidity experience above the assumptions we used in pricing our insurance and investment products. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster or a pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas, as well as an adverse effect on home prices in those areas, which could result in increased loss experience in our mortgage insurance businesses. Disasters or a pandemic also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.\nWe provide mortgage insurance on homes in areas of Australia impacted by the bushfires that occurred in late 2019 and continued into the first quarter of 2020. Although we still do not know the ultimate impact the bushfires will have on our Australia mortgage insurance business, it is possible the affected areas may experience reduced economic activity, which could result in more borrowers defaulting on their loans and/or reduce new business activity for a period of time. Additionally, home values may decrease which could reduce the borrower\u2019s willingness or ability to continue to make mortgage payments and loss mitigation efforts could be minimized.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets, and any impairments of or valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in the future could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently utilize significant deferred tax assets to offset taxable income. The extent to which we can utilize deferred tax assets may be limited for various reasons, including but not limited to changes in tax rules or regulations and if projected future taxable income becomes insufficient to recognize the full benefit of our NOL and foreign tax credit carryforwards. Additionally, our ability to fully use these tax assets could also be adversely affected if we have an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% increase in equity ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Section 382) in any three-year period. Future changes in our stock ownership, depending on the magnitude, including the purchase or sale of our common stock by 5% shareholders, and issuances or redemptions of common stock by us, could result in an ownership change that would trigger the imposition of limitations under Section 382. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that in the future we will not experience limitations with respect to recognizing the benefits of our NOL and foreign tax credit carryforwards for which limitations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90162, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "GNW"}
