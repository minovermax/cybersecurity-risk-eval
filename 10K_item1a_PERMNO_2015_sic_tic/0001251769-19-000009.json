{"cik": "1251769", "company": "Apollo Endosurgery, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and may not be able to achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in 2005. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had net losses of $45.8 million and $27.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $222.8 million. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through equity offerings, the issuance of debt instruments, and from sales of our products. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the acquisition of products, the research and development of products, sales and marketing activities and clinical and regulatory initiatives to obtain approvals for our products. Our ability to generate sufficient revenue from our existing products, and to transition to profitability and generate consistent positive cash flows is uncertain. We may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. We expect that our operating expenses may increase as we continue to build our commercial infrastructure, develop, enhance and commercialize our products and incur additional costs associated with being a public company. As a result, we may incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to successfully develop the therapeutic endoscopy market and successfully commercialize our Endo-bariatric products.\nIt is important to our business that we continue to build a market for therapeutic endoscopy procedures within the bariatric and gastroenterology community. Our Endo-bariatric products offer non-surgical and less-invasive solutions and technology that enable new options for physicians treating their patients who suffer from obesity. However, this is a new market and developing this market is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful due to a variety of factors including lack of physician adoption, patient demand, or both. Even if we are successful in developing additional products in the Endo-bariatric market, the success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022properly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;\n\u2022effectively train physicians on how to use our products and achieve good patient outcomes;\n\u2022effectively communicate with patients and educate them on the benefits of Endo-bariatric procedures;\n\u2022achieve procedure adoption in a timely manner;\n\u2022develop clinical data that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the procedures that use our products;\n\u2022obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022market new devices or modified products in compliance with the regulations of the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022receive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our products; and\n\u2022train the sales and marketing team to effectively support our market development efforts.\nWe are dependent on the success of our Endo-bariatric products following the divestiture of our Surgical product line to ReShape, in December 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from Surgical product sales comprised 31% of\ntotal revenues. While we intend to focus our commercial efforts on our Endo-bariatric products, there can be no assurance that such product lines will be profitable in the future.\nIf we are unsuccessful in developing and commercializing the therapeutic endoscopy market, our ability to increase our revenue will be impaired and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse U.S. and international economic conditions may reduce consumer demand for our products, causing our sales and profitability to suffer.\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets may negatively affect our revenues and operating results. Our Endo-bariatric products, such as the Intragastric Balloon products, have limited reimbursement, and in most cases are not reimbursable by governmental or other health care plans and instead are partially or wholly paid for directly by patients. Sales of our products may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions impacting consumer spending, including among others, increased taxation, higher unemployment, lower consumer confidence in the economy, higher consumer debt levels, lower availability of consumer credit, higher interest rates and hardships relating to declines in the housing and stock markets which have historically caused consumers to reassess their spending choices and reduce their likelihood to pursue elective surgical procedures. Any reduced consumer demand due to adverse economic or market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause sales and profitability to suffer, reduce operating cash flow and result in a decline in the price of our common stock. Adverse economic and market conditions could also have a negative impact on our business by negatively affecting the parties with whom we do business, including among others, our business partners, creditors, third-party contractors and suppliers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.\nOur future growth depends on physician adoption and recommendation of procedures utilizing our products.\nOur ability to sell our products depends on the willingness of our physician customers to adopt our products and to recommend corresponding procedures to their patients. Physicians may not adopt our products unless they determine that they have the necessary skills to use our products and based on their own experience, clinical data, communications from regulatory authorities and published peer-reviewed research that our products provide a safe and effective treatment option. Even if we are able to raise favorable awareness among physicians, physicians may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices and may be hesitant to recommend procedures that utilize our products for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022existing preferences for competitor products or with alternative medical procedures and a general reluctance to change to or use new products or procedures;\n\u2022lack of experience with our products;\n\u2022time and skill commitment that may be necessary to gain familiarity with a new product or new treatment;\n\u2022a perception that our products are unproven, unsafe, ineffective, experimental or too expensive;\n\u2022reluctance for a related hospital or healthcare facility to approve the introduction of a new product or procedure;\n\u2022a preference for an alternative procedure that may afford a physician or a related hospital or healthcare facility greater remuneration; and,\n\u2022the development of new weight loss treatment options, including pharmacological treatments, that are less costly, less invasive, or more effective.\nOur future growth depends on patient awareness of and demand for procedures that use our products.\nThe procedures that utilize our products are generally elective in nature and demand for our products is driven significantly by patient awareness and preference for the procedures that use our products. We provide patient education materials about our products and related procedures through various forms of media. However, the general media, social media and other forms of media outside of our control as well as competing organizations may distribute information that presents our products and related procedures as being unproven, unsafe, ineffective or experimental or otherwise is unfavorable to our products and related procedures. If patient awareness and preference for procedures is not sufficient or is not positive, our future growth will be impaired. In addition, our future growth will be impacted by the level of patient satisfaction achieved from procedures that use our products. If patients who undergo treatment using our product are not satisfied with their results, our reputation and that of our products may suffer. Even if we are able to raise favorable awareness among patients, patients may be hesitant to proceed with a medical treatment for various reasons including:\n\u2022perception that our products are unproven or experimental;\n\u2022reluctance to undergo a medical procedure;\n\u2022reluctance of a prospective patient to commit to long-term lifestyle changes;\n\u2022previous long-term failure with other weight loss programs;\n\u2022out of pocket cost for an elective procedure; and\n\u2022alternative weight loss treatments that are perceived to be more effective or less expensive.\nWe may not be able to successfully introduce new products to the market in a timely manner.\nOur future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to develop and manufacture new products or to acquire new products in a cost-effective manner, to introduce these products to the market on a timely basis and to achieve market acceptance of these products. Factors which may result in delays of new product introductions include capital constraints, research and development delays, lack of personnel with sufficient experience or competence, delays in acquiring regulatory approvals or clearances or delays in closing acquisition transactions. Future product introductions may fail to achieve expected levels of market acceptance including physician adoption, patient awareness or both. Factors impacting the level of market acceptance include the timeliness of our product introductions, the effectiveness of medical education efforts, the effectiveness of patient awareness and educational activities, successful product pricing strategies, available financial and technological resources for product promotion and development, the ability to show clinical benefit from future products, the scope of the indicated use for new products and the availability of coverage and reimbursement for procedures that use future products.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations and sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nThe products we currently market have been approved or cleared by the FDA for specific indications. We train our marketing and direct sales force to not promote our products for uses outside of the FDA-approved or cleared indications for use, known as \"off-label uses.\" We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our products off-label, when in the physician's independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. There may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those approved or cleared by the FDA or any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nPhysicians may also misuse our products, use improper techniques, ignore or disregard information provided in training or fail to obtain adequate training, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability. If our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management's attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance. In addition, if the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or we could be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nIf we are unable to manage and maintain our direct sales and marketing organizations we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue.\nOur operating results are directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our employees. If our direct sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales may suffer. In order to generate our anticipated sales, we will need to maintain a qualified and well-trained direct sales organization. As a result, our future success will depend largely on our ability to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales managers and direct sales representatives. Because of the competition for their services, we cannot assure you we will be able to hire and retain direct sales representatives on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to hire or retain qualified sales representatives would prevent us from expanding our business and generating sales. Additionally, new hires require training and take time before they achieve full productivity. If we fail to train new hires adequately, new hires may not become as productive as may be necessary to maintain or increase our sales and we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on certain suppliers and manufacturers, and disruptions could materially adversely affect our business and future growth.\nIf the supply of materials from our suppliers were to be interrupted or if we experience delays or interruptions from our manufacturers, replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable. In particular, the products which together comprise our ESS products are sourced from a variety of suppliers and manufacturers, and these suppliers and manufacturers further depend on many component providers. As ESS product sales increase, we have experienced times of temporary supply disruption for a variety of reasons and this has caused delays in our fulfillment of customer orders. However, if such a condition were to persist, our business could suffer as our reputation with customers could be damaged and eventually could lead to reduced future demand for our products. An inability to continue to source materials or components from any of our suppliers or manufacturers could be due to reasons outside of our direct control, such as regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier or manufacturer, labor disputes or shortages at the supplier and unexpected demands or quality issues.\nManufacturing of our products requires capital equipment and a well-trained workforce. The sourcing of new manufacturing or supply capacity can present significant lead time. If demand increases faster than we expect, or if we are unable to produce the quantity of goods that we expect with our current suppliers and manufacturers, we will not be able to adequately address demand for our products and our revenues and results of operations would suffer.\nIf we are required to replace a vendor, a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities may be required before the product could be sold with a material or component supplied by a new supplier or manufacturer. The regulatory approval process may take a substantial period of time and we cannot assure investors that we would be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approval for a new material to be used in products on a timely basis, if at all. This could create supply disruptions that would materially adversely affect our business. For example, in instances where we are changing our supplier of a key component of a product, we will need to ensure that we have sufficient supply of the component while the change is reviewed by regulatory authorities.\nWe are dependent on warehouses and service providers in the U.S., Brazil, Australia and the Netherlands for product logistics, order fulfillment and distribution support that are owned and operated by third parties. Our ability to supply products to our customers in a timely manner and at acceptable commercial terms could be disrupted or continue to be disrupted by factors such as fire, earthquake or any other natural disaster, work stoppages or information technology system failures that occur at these third-party warehouse and service providers.\nIt is difficult to forecast future performance, which may cause operational delays or inefficiency.\nWe create internal operational forecasts to determine requirements for components and materials used in the manufacture of our products and to make production plans. Our limited operating history and commercial experience may make it difficult for us to accurately predict future production requirements. If we forecast inaccurately, this may cause us to have shortfalls or backorders that may negatively impact our reputation with customers and cause them to seek alternative products, or could lead us to have excessive inventory, scrap or similar operational and financial inefficiency that could harm our business.\nWe compete or may compete in the future against other companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources, which may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration or improved operating results.\nOur industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and activities of other industry participants.\nThese participants may enjoy several competitive advantages, including:\n\u2022greater financial and human capital resources;\n\u2022significantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022established relationships with physicians, referring physicians, customers and third-party payors;\n\u2022additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and\n\u2022established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks.\nIf another company successfully develops an approach for the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions, including obesity, that is less invasive or more effective than our current product offerings, sales of our products would be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate or expand operations and processes in connection with acquisitions.\nOur Surgical product line, which we recently divested, and our IGB product line were acquired in December 2013. In the future, should we grow or acquire new assets or businesses, we expect to incrementally hire and train new personnel and implement appropriate financial and managerial controls, systems and procedures in order to effectively manage our growth and integrate newly acquired operations and processes.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management's attention and harm our reputation and business. We may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices and drug products. This risk exists even if a device or product is approved or cleared for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities regulated by the FDA, or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products and product candidates are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our products or our product candidates could result in patient injury or death. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products contribute to, or merely appear to or are alleged to have contributed to, patient injury or death. In addition, an injury that is caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and raw materials, may be the basis for a claim against us. Further, because we are obligated to continue providing certain transition services, including manufacturing and distribution support, to ReShape for our divested Surgical Product line, we may be subject to product liability claims from sales of Surgical products by ReShape, over which we have limited to no control. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products or product candidates, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourself against product liability claims, we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022litigation costs;\n\u2022distraction of management's attention from our primary business;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize our products or, if approved or cleared, our product candidates;\n\u2022decreased demand for our products or, if approved or cleared, product candidates;\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022product recall or withdrawal from the market;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; or\n\u2022loss of revenue.\nWhile we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, any recall or market withdrawal of our products may delay the supply of those products to our customers and may impact our reputation. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in initiating appropriate market recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future or that these efforts will have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Such recalls and withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our products, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, although we maintain product liability and clinical study liability insurance that we believe is appropriate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. Our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and, if available, coverage may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our facilities or the facility of a supplier become inoperable, we will be unable to continue to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our products and, as a result, our business will be harmed.\nWe do not have redundant facilities. We perform substantially all of our manufacturing in a single location in Costa Rica. Our manufacturing facility and equipment would be costly to replace and would require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The manufacturing facility may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including, but not limited to, flooding, fire, earthquakes, volcanic activity and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for some period of time. The inability to perform those activities, combined with our limited inventory of reserve raw materials and finished product, may result in the inability to continue manufacturing our products during such periods and the loss of customers, potential liabilities under our transition services agreements with ReShape for the manufacture and distribution of Surgical products or harm to our reputation. Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and this insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, security breaches or cyber-attacks\nOur computer systems, as well as those of various third-parties which we rely, including those of contractors, consultants, and law and accounting firms, may sustain damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, data breaches, phishing attacks, cyber criminals, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We rely on our third-party providers to implement effective security measures and identify and correct for any such failures, deficiencies, or breaches. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We may in the future experience material system failures or security breaches that could cause interruptions in our operations or result in material disruption of our product development programs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability.\nIf we experience significant disruptions in our or our third-party service providers' information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, including but not limited to accounting, data storage, compliance, sales operations, inventory management and product support applications. A number of information technology systems in use to support our business operations are owned and/or operated by third-party service providers over whom we have no or very limited control, and upon whom we have to rely to maintain business continuity procedures and adequate security controls to ensure high availability of their information technology systems and to protect our proprietary information.\nWhile we will attempt to mitigate interruptions, they could still occur and disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain and otherwise adequately service our customers. In the event we experience significant disruptions to our information technology systems, we may not be able to repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we perform business improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes. If any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained, they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe ability to protect our or our third-party service providers' information systems and electronic transmissions of sensitive and/or proprietary data from data corruption, cyber-based attacks, security breaches or privacy violations is critical to the success of our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information, including personal information of our customers and prospective product end-users. A security breach of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware attacks by hackers and similar breaches, may cause all or portions of our or our third-party providers' systems to be unavailable, create system disruptions or shutdowns, and lead to erasure of critical data and software or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. We invest in security technology to protect our data against risks of data security breaches and cyber-attacks, and we have implemented solutions, processes, and procedures to help mitigate these risks at various locations, such as encryption, virus protection, security firewalls and information security and privacy policies.\nNonetheless, our or our third-party service providers' information technology and infrastructure are subject to attacks by hackers and may be breached due to inadequacy of the protective measures undertaken, human errors or omissions, malfeasance, or other disruptions. The age of our or our third-party providers' information technology systems, as well as the level of protection and business continuity or disaster recovery capability, varies significantly by application software and third\n-party service provider, and there can be no guarantee that any such measures, to the extent they are in place, will be effective. In addition, a security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure of consumer information (including personally identifiable information, protected health information, or personal data of EU residents) could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with disparate federal, state and foreign breach notification laws and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. If we or our third-party providers are unable to prevent security breaches or privacy violations or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, we may be subject to additional legal claims or proceedings, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss and other regulatory penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Hackers and other cyber criminals are using increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving techniques, and we may need to expend substantial additional resources to continue to protect against potential security breaches or to address problems caused by such attacks or any breach of our safeguards. In addition, a data security breach could distract management or other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties, impair our ability to transact business with our customers, lose access to critical data or systems, or compromise confidential information including trade secrets and other intellectual property, any of which may harm our competitive position, require us to allocate more resources to improved security technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") that became effective on May 25, 2018 imposes significant obligations on many U.S. companies, including us, to protect the personal information of European citizens. GDPR may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices and that our practices will be found to be non-compliant with this regulation. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines, orders or guidance requiring that we change our data practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nFluctuations in insurance costs and availability could adversely affect our profitability or our risk management profile.\nWe hold a number of insurance policies, including product liability insurance, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, general liability insurance, property insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, if any of our current insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical, we would be required to operate our business without coverage from commercial insurance providers. If we operate our business without insurance, we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us that would have otherwise been covered by insurance, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.\nWe believe that our continued success depends to a significant extent upon our efforts and ability to retain highly qualified personnel. All of our officers and other employees are at-will employees, and therefore may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. The replacement of any of our key personnel likely would involve significant time and costs and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and would harm our business.\nMany of our employees have become or will soon become vested in a substantial amount of stock or number of stock options. Our employees may be more likely to leave the Company if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly below the market price of our common stock. Further, our employees\u2019 ability to exercise those options and sell their stock in a public market may result in a higher than normal turnover rate. We do not carry any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies.\nWe may fail to perform certain services under the transition services agreement with ReShape, and the performance of such services may negatively impact our business and operations.\nWe have entered into a transition services agreement and related supply and distribution agreements with ReShape in connection with the sale of our Surgical product line to ReShape pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to manufacture the products for ReShape for up to two years and serve as ReShape\u2019s distributor of the product line outside of the U.S. for up to one year. If we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under these agreements, we may be subject to liabilities to ReShape or may be required to re-perform such services at our expense.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. The reported material weakness did not result in any adjustment to our financial statements or restatement of prior financial statements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are implementing measures designed to improve our internal controls over financial reporting to remediate this material weakness. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, which audits our financial statements, issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to implement, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness we have identified or that future material weaknesses will not occur.\nIf we fail to remediate our existing material weakness or identify new material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lack confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected regardless of whether material inaccuracies are determined to exist in our reported financial statements. If material inaccuracies are determined to exist in our financial statements or we are unable to report our financial statements on a timely basis, we could also become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm our reputation and financial condition or divert financial and management resources from our regular business activities.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s pending exit from the EU could lead to increased market access issues, legal issues, and economic conditions which could adversely impact our business.\nOn June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). On March 29, 2017, the U.K. government delivered to the European Council notice of its intention to leave the EU and, in the absence of an executed withdrawal agreement with the EU, the effective date of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU will be March 29, 2019. Our subsidiary that manages our European business is located in the U.K. and, thus, there are many ways in which our business operations may be impacted by Brexit, only some of which we can identify at this time. Our notified body in Europe was BSI which is based in the U.K., which will no longer have standing in the EU as a notified body. We are transferring our notified body to BSI in the Netherlands which will require that we change product labeling and packaging for all our products and other potential implications that have yet to be identified at this time. Financial markets could experience volatility which could negatively impact currency exchange rates and therefore the translated U.S. dollar value of our local currency sales to customers in the U.K. or Europe. We do not hedge our foreign currency translation risk. Our warehousing and distribution hub for Europe is in the Netherlands and distribution of our products in the U.K. market may be slowed or disrupted and our U.K. sales may suffer as a result. Our efforts to mitigate the risk of this supply disruption to our U.K. customers may not prove sufficient. Until the final terms of Brexit are known, impacts to relevant currencies and business operations will be difficult to predict.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Review and Approval of Our Products\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, including the requirement to obtain premarket approval and the requirement to report adverse events and violations of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that could present significant risk of injury to patients. Even though we have received FDA approval of our PMA applications and 510(k) clearances to commercially market our products, we will continue to be subject to extensive FDA regulatory oversight.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under Section 510(k) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application, or PMA unless the device is specifically exempt from those requirements. The FDA will clear marketing of a lower risk medical device through the 510(k) process if the manufacturer demonstrates that the new product is substantially equivalent to other pre-amendment, 510(k)-exempt, 510(k) cleared products, or PMA-approved products that have subsequently been down-classified. If the FDA determines that the device is not \"substantially equivalent\" to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the statute in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for a direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.\nHigh risk devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, require the approval of a PMA. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. Of our products, Orbera is a class III product and has been approved through the FDA's PMA process and our OverStitch products are class II and have been cleared through the 510(k) process. In addition, although FDA has granted PMA approval for our class III products, holding those approvals in good standing requires ongoing compliance with FDA reporting requirements and conditions of approval including the completion of lengthy and expensive post market approval studies. Despite the time, effort and cost required to obtain approval, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet all FDA requirements to maintain our PMA approvals or that circumstances outside of our control may cause the FDA to withdraw our PMA approvals.\nOur failure to comply with U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental regulations could lead to the issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory clearance or approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. In the most extreme cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facility are possible.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we market and sell our products internationally, we may be subject to rigorous international regulation in the future. In these circumstances, we would rely significantly on our foreign independent distributors to comply with the varying regulations, and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries.\nIf we fail to comply with U.S. federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties, including, but not limited to, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely impact our reputation and business operations.\nOur industry is subject to numerous U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, privacy and transparency laws and regulations. Our relationships with healthcare providers and entities, including but not limited to, physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, group purchasing organizations and our international distributors are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws or regulations can subject us to penalties, including, but not limited to, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs and the curtailment of our operations. Healthcare fraud and abuse regulations are complex and subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or regulation has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; the FCA, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented, a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;\n\u2022the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, each as amended, and their implementing regulations, which impose requirements upon certain entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of health information;\n\u2022the Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections;\n\u2022the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits corrupt payments, gifts or transfers of value to foreign officials; and\n\u2022foreign or U.S. state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws\nWhile we do not submit claims for reimbursement to payors and our customers make the ultimate decision on how to submit claims, from time-to-time, we may be asked for reimbursement guidance by our customers. Failure to comply with any of these laws, or any action against us for alleged violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into consulting agreements with physicians, including some who use our products and may influence the ordering and use of our products. While we believe these transactions were structured to comply with all applicable laws, including state and federal anti-kickback laws, to the extent applicable, should the government take the position that these transactions are prohibited arrangements that must be restructured or discontinued, we could be subject to significant penalties. The medical device industry\u2019s relationship with physicians is under increasing scrutiny by the OIG, the DOJ, state attorneys general, and other foreign and domestic government agencies. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations governing our relationships with physicians, or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG, DOJ, state attorneys general and other government agencies could significantly harm our business.\nTo enforce compliance with the healthcare regulatory laws, federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Responding to investigations can be time and resource consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to onerous additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn certain cases, actions to pursue claims under the FCA may be brought by private individuals on behalf of the government. These lawsuits are known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions and the individuals bringing such suits, sometimes known as \u201crelators\u201d or, more commonly, \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. For example, in March 2017, we were informed by the Department of Justice that we were a subject in a federal False Claims Act investigation. The government\u2019s investigation concerned whether there had been a violation of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 et. seq. related to our marketing of the Lap-Band System, including the web-based physician locator provided on our website Lap-Band.com. We cooperated fully with the investigation, and on August 21, 2017, we were notified by the Department of Justice that we were no longer a subject in such investigation.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s provision commonly referred to as the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, as well as similar state and foreign laws, impose obligations on medical device manufacturers to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value provided, directly or indirectly, to certain physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Failure to comply with any of these state, federal, or foreign transparency and disclosure requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.\nAlthough compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nMost of these laws apply to not only the actions taken by us, but also actions taken by our distributors. We have limited knowledge and control over the business practices of our distributors, and we may face regulatory action against us as a result of their actions which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal or state regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Any state or federal regulatory review of the Company, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether or not retroactive.\nHealthcare cost containment pressures and legislative or administrative reforms resulting in restrictive reimbursement practices of third-party payors could decrease the demand for our products, the prices that customers are willing to pay and the number of procedures performed using our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAll third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the U.S. or outside, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. These cost-control methods include prospective payment systems, bundled payment models, capitated arrangements, group purchasing, benefit redesign, pre-authorization processes and requirements for second opinions prior to major surgery. These cost-control methods also potentially limit the amount that healthcare providers may be willing to pay for our products. Therefore, coverage or reimbursement for medical devices may decrease in the future.\nFederal and state governments in the U.S. and outside the U.S. may enact legislation to modify the healthcare system which may result in increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. These reform measures may limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and also indirectly affect the amounts that private payors are willing to pay. These changes could result in reduced demand for our products and may adversely affect our operating results.\nFurther, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment amounts are updated and revised by third-party payors. In cases where the cost of certain of our products are recovered by the healthcare provider as part of the payment for performing a procedure and not separately reimbursed or paid directly by the patient, these updates could directly impact the demand for our products. We cannot predict how pending and future healthcare legislation will impact our business, and any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our products or lowers reimbursement for procedures using our products could materially affect our business.\nModifications to our marketed products may require new 510(k) or de novo clearances or PMA approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) or de novo clearances or premarket approvals, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. For example, a manufacturer may determine that a modification does not significantly affect safety or efficacy and does not represent a major change in its intended use, so that no new 510(k) clearance is necessary. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer's decision and may disagree. The FDA may also on its own initiative determine that a new clearance or approval is required. We have made modifications to our products in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing our products as modified, which could require us to redesign our products and harm our operating results. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nIf a manufacturer determines that a modification to an FDA-cleared device could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, then the manufacturer must file for a new 510(k) clearance or possibly de novo, down classification, or a premarket approval application. Where we determine that modifications to our products require a new 510(k) or de novo clearance or premarket approval application, we may not be able to obtain those additional clearances or approvals for the modifications or additional indications in a timely manner, or at all. For those products sold in the EU, we must notify our EU Notified Body if significant changes are made to the products or if there are substantial changes to our quality assurance systems affecting those products. Obtaining clearances and approvals can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nFor our class III devices, new PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device's indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. There is no guarantee that the FDA will grant PMA approval of our future products and failure to obtain necessary approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Delays in receipt or failure to receive approvals, the loss of previously received approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could reduce our sales, profitability and future growth prospects.\nIf our products contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device were to recur. As required per the FDA Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Part 803 we have established procedures and processes for documentation and evaluation of all complaints relative to reporting requirements. As with all device manufacturers, we have 30 days from \"becoming aware\" of an incident to submit to FDA a MDR for an event that reasonably suggests that a device has or may have caused or contributed to the incident, or five work days for an event designated by the FDA or an event that requires remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health. As part of this assessment we conduct a complaint investigation of each reported Adverse Event. In the event that an investigation is inconclusive (i.e., the investigation cannot confirm whether or not our product was a cause of an Adverse Event), our policy and practice is to default in favor of reporting events to the FDA. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nThe FDA may issue safety alerts in response to its review of reported Adverse Events that do not require voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement but that still negatively affect our product marketing efforts. For instance, in February of 2017, the FDA issued an update to alert health care providers of reported adverse events of liquid-filled intragastric balloons including several dozen incidents of balloon over-inflation and, separately, a set of reports of acute pancreatitis. In August of 2017 the FDA issued a second update to alert health care providers of five reports of unanticipated deaths that had been reported since 2016 in patients with liquid-filled intragastric balloons, four of which had received our IGB . In June 2018, the FDA issued a new update to alert health care providers of five additional reports worldwide of unanticipated deaths that had been reported since the August 2017 letter to Health Care Providers and also announced the approval of labeling changes for the Orbera Balloon System. Four of the additional mentioned reported deaths involved patients who had received our IGB product. In each case, the occurrence had been self-reported by us to the FDA as part of our normal product surveillance process. Neither the FDA's August 2017 letter to Health Care Providers nor the June 2018 letter to Health Care Providers indicates that the patient deaths were related to the intragastric balloon product or the insertion procedures. However, both letters to Health Care Providers subjected us to adverse publicity that harmed our business.\nOur international operations must comply with local laws and regulations that present certain legal and operating risks, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently operate in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Costa Rica, Australia and various European countries and our products are approved for sale in over 70 different countries; our activities are subject to U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws. Compliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance.\nOther laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. FCPA, as well as export control laws and economic sanctions laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant costs and disruption of business associated with an internal and/or government investigation, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting.\nOur international operations present the same risks as presented by our U.S. operations plus unique risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These unique risks include:\n\u2022foreign regulatory approval which could result in delays leading to possible insufficient inventory levels;\n\u2022foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022reliance on sales people and distributors;\n\u2022pricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022competitive disadvantage to competitors who have more established business and customer relationships in a given market;\n\u2022reduced or varied intellectual property rights available in some countries;\n\u2022economic instability of certain countries;\n\u2022the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls, regulations and laws;\n\u2022changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations, importation requirements and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022scrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on the Company; and\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local companies.\nIf we experience any of these events, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA or foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain approval or clearance, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-market clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the QSR. The QSR covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to QSR requirements in the U.S. or experience delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals or clearances, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The failure by the Company or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspection observations or product safety issues, could result in any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022refusing or delaying our requests for regulatory approvals or clearances of new products or modified products;\n\u2022withdrawing PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in a failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nOur products and operations are required to comply with standards set by foreign regulatory bodies, and those standards, types of evaluation and scope of review differ among foreign regulatory bodies. If we fail to comply with any of these standards adequately or if changes to our manufacturing or supply practices require additional regulatory approval, a foreign regulatory body may take adverse actions or cause delays within their jurisdiction similar to those within the power of the FDA. Any such action or circumstance may harm our reputation and business, and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In\naddition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nU.S. legislative, FDA or global regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nFor example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was enacted into law. The Act includes many provisions that impact the regulation of medical devices. For example, the Act includes provisions regarding, among other things:\n\u2022expediting the development and prioritizing FDA review of \u201cbreakthrough\u201d technologies\n\u2022expanding the scope of diseases/conditions eligible for a humanitarian device exemption\n\u2022encouraging FDA to rely more on real-world evidence to demonstrate device safety and effectiveness\n\u2022emphasizing the least burdensome standard for device reviews\nMoreover, leadership, personnel and structural changes within the FDA as well as recent and future federal election outcomes could result in significant legislative and regulatory reforms impacting the FDA\u2019s regulation of our products. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nIn addition, on May 25, 2017, the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (\"MDR 2017\") was published. When it becomes effective on May 26, 2020, the MDR 2017 will change the obligations of medical device manufacturers with product in the EU and will subject high risk medical devices to additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure. MDR 2017 repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA Member States. Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:\n\u2022add new the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;\n\u2022establish explicit provisions on a manufacturers' responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n\u2022require the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;\n\u2022set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and\n\u2022add rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market\nOnce applicable, the MDR 2017 may impose increased compliance obligations for us to access the EU market.\nIn order to continue to sell our products in Europe, we must maintain our CE marks and continue to comply with certain EU directives and, in the future with MDR 2017. Our failure to continue to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements,\nincluding those administered by authorities of the EEA countries, could result in enforcement actions against us, including refusal, suspension or withdrawal of our CE Certificates of Conformity by our Notified Body, which could impair our ability to market products in the EEA in the future. Any changes to the membership of the EU, such as the departure of the United Kingdom (Brexit), may impact the regulatory requirements for the impacted countries and impair our business operations and our ability to market products in such countries.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with post market studies do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to maintain regulatory approval for our products.\nWe often must rely on third parties, such as medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract research organizations and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials and provide data or prepare deliverables for our PMA post market studies required to keep our PMA approvals in good standing. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to applicable clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may be at risk of losing our regulatory approvals or fail to obtain desired regulatory approvals, which could harm our business.\nOur operations involve the use of hazardous and toxic materials, and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive, and may affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault, and environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could harm our business. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of environmental and health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, third-party property damage and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production or a cessation of operations. We also expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental and health and safety laws on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws, they will likely result in additional costs, and may require us to change how we manufacture our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. FCPA and similar laws associated with any activities outside the U.S. could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the U.S. FCPA, and other anti-bribery legislation around the world. The FCPA generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments, offers or promises to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other advantages. In addition, the FCPA imposes recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on publicly traded corporations and their foreign affiliates. We may face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other similar foreign antibribery laws. Although we have implemented safeguards and training, including company policies requiring our employees, distributors, consultants and agents to comply with the FCPA and similar laws, our international operations nonetheless present a risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors, because these parties are not always subject to our control. Any violation of the FCPA and related policies could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies and inventions used in, or embodied by, our products. To protect our proprietary technology, we rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions in our supply, consulting and employment agreements. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage.\nPatents\nThe process of applying for patent protection itself is time consuming and expensive and we cannot assure investors that all of our patent applications will issue as patents or that, if issued, they will issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. The rights granted to us under our patents, including prospective rights sought in our pending patent applications, may not be\nmeaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage and they could be opposed, contested or circumvented by our competitors or be declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings.\nWe own numerous issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our products and methods of using our products, as well as individual components of our products. If any of our patents are challenged, invalidated or legally circumvented by third parties, and if we do not own other enforceable patents protecting our products, competitors could market products and use processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours, and our business will suffer. In addition, the patents we own may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage, and competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes comparable to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may also determine from time to time to discontinue the payment of maintenance fees, if we determine that certain patents are not material to our business.\nWe may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\"), or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review, or other patent office proceedings or litigation, in the U.S. or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to the Company, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nMoreover, the USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products or procedures, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, we do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist in the future, and the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products that are the same as or similar to our products.\nTrademarks\nWe rely on our trademarks as one means to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. Our trademark applications may not be approved, however. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nTrade Secrets and Know-How\nWe may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees or current employees, despite the existence of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective.\nMoreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected so as to protect our market against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nWe may in the future be a party to patent and other intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our products.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by frequent and extensive intellectual property litigation. Additionally, the bariatric and therapeutic endoscopy markets are competitive. Our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our products and the methods we employ are covered by their patents. If our products or methods are found to infringe, we could be prevented from manufacturing or marketing our products. In the event that we become involved in such a dispute, we may incur significant costs and expenses and may need to devote resources to resolving any claims, which would reduce the cash we have available for operations and may be distracting to management. We do not know whether our competitors or potential competitors have applied for, will apply for, or will obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, sell, import or export our products.\nCompeting products may also be sold in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, alleging our infringement of a competitor\u2019s patents, we could be prevented from marketing our products in one or more foreign countries. We may also initiate litigation against third parties to protect our own intellectual property. Our intellectual property has not been tested in prior litigation. If we initiate litigation to protect our rights, we run the risk of having our intellectual property rights adjudicated, invalidated, or limited in scope, which would undermine our competitive position.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, expensive and time-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to our products, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If relevant patents held by other parties are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be prevented from selling our products unless we can obtain licenses to use technology or ideas covered by such patents. We do not know whether any necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we cannot obtain these licenses, we could be forced to design around those patents at additional cost or abandon our products altogether. As a result, our ability to grow our business and compete in the market may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We could in the future be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement and litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, a court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products or information that is essential to our business operations, if such technologies, features or information are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies, features or information that are important or essential to our products or business operations would have a material adverse effect on our business and may prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products and conduct business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Requirements and Finances\nWe have substantial indebtedness which contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility and our failure to comply with the covenants and payment requirements of our indebtedness may subject us to increased interest expenses, lender consent and amendment costs or adverse financial consequences.\nIn March 2019, we borrowed $35.0 million principal amount of debt under a term loan facility (\"Solar Debt Facility) with Solar Capital, Ltd. (\"Solar\") under which we may borrow an additional $15.0 million upon our request subject to further credit approval. We cannot assure that additional funding will be received. We used $22.4 million of the proceeds to repay the existing senior secured credit facility. Our outstanding debt is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and contains customary financial and operating covenants limiting our ability to transfer or dispose of assets, merge with or acquire other companies, make investments, pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness and liens and conduct transactions with affiliates without Solar's consent. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions until our current debt obligations\nare paid in full or we obtain the consent of the lender. In addition, we are required to prepare our financial statements and receive audits on our annual financial statements in a timely manner, meet certain financial ratio requirement and pay interest and principal when due. Furthermore, under the Solar Debt Facility our interest rate is tied to LIBOR and in the event of an increase in the LIBOR rate, we will be required to pay greater interest expenses, which will have an adverse effect on our income from operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent that our operating trends do not enable us to meet our financial and restrictive covenant requirements, we are unable to pay interest or principal when due or we are unable to meet other covenants and requirements contained within our credit agreements, we may default under such agreement. A default under any such agreements could result in further increases in consent or amendment fees to lender, further increases in interest costs, the imposition of additional constraints on borrowing by our lender or potentially more serious liquidity constraints and adverse financial consequences, including reductions in the value of our common stock or the necessity of seeking protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws. To remedy issues we may encounter with meeting our debt obligations, or for other purposes, we may find it necessary to seek further refinancing of our indebtedness, and may do so with debt instruments that are more costly than our existing instruments (and which will rank senior to our common shareholders), or we may issue additional securities which may dilute the ownership interests or value of our existing shareholders.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or revenue to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and interest on our debt. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance any such debt.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce, eliminate or abandon our commercialization efforts or product development programs.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern may require us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations. We may need to raise substantial additional capital to:\n\u2022expand the commercialization of our products;\n\u2022fund our operations and clinical studies;\n\u2022continue our research and development activities;\n\u2022support and expand ongoing manufacturing activities;\n\u2022defend, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022address legal or enforcement actions by the FDA or other governmental agencies and remediate underlying problems;\n\u2022commercialize our new products in development, if any such products receive regulatory clearance or approval for commercial sale; and\n\u2022acquire companies or products and in-license products or intellectual property.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, revenue, proceeds from recent sales of common stock, and available debt and equity financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations at least through the next twelve months. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Any future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies;\n\u2022the cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022the cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that our product infringes third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022the cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, products liability claims;\n\u2022the cost and timing of additional regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022the cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress and cost to expand ongoing manufacturing activities;\n\u2022costs associated with any product recall that may occur;\n\u2022the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or invest in products, technologies and businesses\n\u2022the costs of operating as a public company; and\n\u2022the ability of third-parties to pay future invoices and obligations.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets, or delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our development programs.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of early-stage medical device, pharmaceutical and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022a slowdown in the medical device industry or the general economy;\n\u2022inability to obtain adequate supply of the components for any of our products, or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022performance of third parties on whom we may rely, including for the manufacture of the components for our products, including their ability to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the results of our current and any future clinical trials of our devices;\n\u2022unanticipated or serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our products;\n\u2022the entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key commercial partner agreements;\n\u2022the initiation of, material developments in or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022announcements by us, our commercial partners or our competitors of new products or product enhancements, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022competition from existing technologies and products or new technologies and products that may emerge;\n\u2022the loss of key employees;\n\u2022changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who may cover our common stock;\n\u2022general and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022the low trading volume and the high proportion of shares held by affiliates;\n\u2022changes in the structure of health care payment systems and insurance coverage related to our products and procedures that utilize our products; and\n\u2022period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nWe will incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nWe will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We will also incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as new rules implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Our executive officers, service providers and other personnel will need to devote substantial time to these rules and regulations. These rules and regulations are expected to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some other activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers of the Company, which may adversely affect investor confidence and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware General Corporate Law could make an acquisition of the Company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove Company management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that we will retain future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in our credit agreement. Additionally, we are a holding company, and our ability to pay dividends will be dependent upon our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions, which may be restricted by covenants in our credit agreement or any future contractual obligations.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or other securities may result in significant dilution or could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. However, if certain of our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In addition, shares of common stock that are subject to outstanding options will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting agreements and Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe also expect that additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe ownership of our common stock is currently highly concentrated and may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, this group of stockholders has the ability to control us through this ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nThe limited public float and trading volume for our common stock may have an adverse impact and cause significant fluctuation of market price.\nOur common stock is held by a relatively small number of stockholders. Our officers, directors, and members of management acquire stock or have the potential to own stock through previously granted equity awards. Consequently, our common stock has a relatively small float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell our stock or the price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by those larger stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and our stock could be difficult for a stockholder to liquidate.\nThere can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained in the future. The lack of an active trading market may make it more difficult for you to sell our shares and could lead to our share price being depressed or more volatile.", "PERMNO": 13648, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "APEN"}
