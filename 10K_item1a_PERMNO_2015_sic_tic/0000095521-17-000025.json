{"cik": "95521", "company": "SUPERVALU INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nVarious risks and uncertainties may affect Supervalu\u2019s business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or Supervalu\u2019s other SEC filings may have a material impact on Supervalu\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nStrategic and Operational Risks\nSupervalu faces intense competition.\nThe grocery business is intensely competitive, and the recent and ongoing consolidation within the grocery industry is expected to result in increased competition, including from some competitors that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than Supervalu. The grocery industry is characterized by relatively small operating margins, and as competition in certain areas intensifies and as the industry continues to consolidate, Supervalu\u2019s results of operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales and reductions in gross margins. See \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d for a discussion of the competitive environment.\nIf Supervalu is unable to appropriately respond to competition and execute on its initiatives to improve the competitive position or profitability of Supervalu, and differentiate Supervalu\u2019s offerings, Supervalu\u2019s sales, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSupervalu may engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses or disposing divested businesses and may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures.\nSupervalu may engage in strategic transactions. Acquisitions and dispositions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of acquired businesses and the separation of disposed businesses. The risks include Supervalu\u2019s due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues, Supervalu may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, and Supervalu may not be able to integrate acquisitions with its operations or separate divested businesses and related obligations from its operations as planned. Supervalu may also not realize the degree or timing of benefits or synergies it anticipates when it first enters into a transaction. There can be no assurances that Supervalu will manage acquisitions and dispositions successfully, that strategic opportunities will be available to Supervalu on acceptable terms or at all, or that Supervalu will be able to consummate desired transactions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn April 10, 2017, Supervalu entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Unified Grocers, Inc., a West Coast focused wholesale grocery and specialty distributor, in a transaction valued at approximately $375, comprised of approximately $114 in cash for 100% of the outstanding stock of Unified Grocers plus the assumption and pay-off of Unified Grocers\u2019 net debt at closing, which was approximately $261 as of April 1, 2017. There are no purchase price adjustments for any changes in Unified Grocers\u2019 net debt between signing and closing or otherwise. The process of consummating the proposed acquisition of Unified Grocers may be disruptive to Supervalu\u2019s business operations and may distract Supervalu\u2019s management team from their day-to-day responsibilities. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, which may not be obtained or satisfied, and as a result and due to other factors outside Supervalu\u2019s control, the acquisition may not be completed on the current terms or on the timing currently contemplated, or at all. There can also be no assurance the Supervalu will be able to successfully integrate Unified Grocers to achieve the operational efficiencies, including synergistic and other benefits of the proposed acquisition, or effectively retain key employees and maintain and grow customer relationships. Any of these risks or uncertainties, including the inability to complete the proposed acquisition in the time period and on the terms contemplated, could adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSupervalu\u2019s Wholesale distribution business could be adversely affected if Supervalu is not able to affiliate new customers or retain existing customers, or if Supervalu\u2019s Wholesale customers fail to perform.\nThe profitability of Supervalu\u2019s Wholesale segment is dependent upon sufficient volume to support Supervalu\u2019s operating infrastructure, which is dependent on the ability of Supervalu to attract new customers and retain existing customers. The inability to attract new customers or the loss of existing customers to a competing wholesaler or due to closure, vertical integration by an existing customer converting to self-distribution, or industry consolidation may negatively impact Supervalu\u2019s sales and operating margins.\nSupervalu\u2019s success also relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of its Wholesale customers. These Wholesale customers manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their stores. They may not experience an acceptable level of sales or profitability, and Supervalu\u2019s revenues and gross margins could be negatively affected as a result. Supervalu may also need to extend credit to its Wholesale customers, including through loans, market support or guarantees, and while Supervalu seeks to obtain security interests and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations Supervalu extends, such collateral may not be sufficient to cover its exposure. If sales trends or profitability worsen for Wholesale customers, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, lost business for Supervalu, delayed or reduced payments to Supervalu or defaults on payments or other liabilities owed by Wholesale customers to Supervalu, any of which could adversely impact Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations as well as its ability to grow its Wholesale business. In this regard, Supervalu\u2019s Wholesale customers are affected by the same economic conditions, including food deflation, and competition that Supervalu\u2019s Retail segment is facing. The magnitude of these risks increases as the size of Supervalu\u2019s Wholesale customers increases.\nFailure to affiliate new customers and retain existing customers for Supervalu\u2019s professional services, or the failure to perform the services as required, could adversely impact Supervalu\u2019s results of operations.\nSupervalu provides numerous services to its Wholesale customers to support the operation of their businesses and stores. Supervalu has been working to leverage its experience, infrastructure and investments to engage new customers and expand the scope of services received by existing customers. If Supervalu is unable to successfully implement this strategy, including differentiating the quality and breadth of Supervalu\u2019s services to customers, in a highly competitive and consolidating environment, or if Supervalu is unable to perform the services up to the customers\u2019 expectations, Supervalu\u2019s results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nSupervalu has significant service relationships with Albertson\u2019s LLC, NAI and Save-A-Lot, and the wind-down of Supervalu\u2019s relationship with Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI (and any future wind down of Save-A-Lot) could adversely impact Supervalu\u2019s results of operations.\nSupervalu has provided significant support services to Albertson\u2019s since 2006 and to Save-A-Lot since Supervalu divested it in December 2016. Despite Supervalu believing that it met service expectations, Albertson\u2019s has determined to wind down its services relationship with Supervalu after it acquired Safeway and now has access to these services from Safeway\u2019s platform. Supervalu expects its services to Albertson\u2019s to be fully wound down over the next approximately two to three years. Supervalu will lose a significant amount of revenue and corresponding operating earnings as a result of this wind down. Supervalu has been executing on its plan to reduce costs, grow its sales and enhance its margins over the past several years. These efforts have contributed to Supervalu's profitability, including the TSA. As the revenue Supervalu receives from the TSA continues to decline, Supervalu does not believe that it will be able to grow sales quickly enough or further eliminate costs or enhance margin to fully mitigate the lost revenue as the TSA unwinds. Failure to execute on Supervalu\u2019s services offering and growth strategy, including making the necessary capital investments for that growth while managing additional cost reductions, could further adversely impact Supervalu\u2019s results of operations. Supervalu\u2019s results of operations could also be adversely impacted if Supervalu is not able to transition and wind down the Albertson\u2019s services in the manner or timeline anticipated. Supervalu is working closely with Albertson\u2019s on the wind down but the execution of that wind down is dependent on Albertson\u2019s.\nSupervalu\u2019s large professional services agreements, including Supervalu\u2019s agreement with Save-A-Lot, provide certain rights for the customers. The services agreement will typically include a fixed term but provide the customer certain termination rights, including in the event of Supervalu\u2019s material breach, and may give the customer certain termination and monetary rights with respect to specified services or service categories in the event Supervalu does not perform to agreed-upon minimum levels of service. The services agreement will also generally require Supervalu to indemnify the customer against third-party claims arising out of the performance of the services under the agreement. Termination of services agreements, in whole or in part, and in particular the services agreement with Save-A-Lot and the wind-down of the services agreement with Albertson\u2019s, could adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s business or results of operations.\nSupervalu\u2019s inability to maintain or increase its operating margins could adversely affect its results of operations and the price of Supervalu\u2019s stock.\nAs competition increases, the grocery industry consolidates and Supervalu attempts to affiliate larger Wholesale customers, Supervalu expects to continue to face pressure on its operating margins. If Supervalu is not able to continue to capture scale efficiencies and enhance its merchandise offerings, Supervalu may not be able to achieve its goals with respect to operating margins. In addition, if Supervalu does not continuously refine and improve its systems, Supervalu may not be able to increase sales, effectively manage inventory and procurement processes or effectively manage customer pricing plans. As a result, Supervalu\u2019s operating margins may stagnate or decline, which could adversely affect the price of Supervalu\u2019s stock.\nSupervalu may not be able to grow or maintain its levels of identical store sales.\nSupervalu has experienced negative identical store sales in its Retail operations in recent periods. A variety of factors affect identical store sales and profitability, including in-store performance, consumer tastes, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, deflation or inflation, and weather conditions, and many of these factors are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict in advance. If Supervalu\u2019s identical store sales continue to decline or fail to meet market expectations, Supervalu\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected and the price of Supervalu\u2019s stock could decline.\nSupervalu\u2019s indebtedness could decrease Supervalu\u2019s financial and operational flexibility and Supervalu\u2019s borrowing costs could increase.\nSupervalu\u2019s credit facilities contain covenants that limit Supervalu\u2019s ability to acquire assets, dispose of assets and use the proceeds thereof, create liens on property, incur or prepay indebtedness and pay dividends, among other things and subject to certain exceptions. These covenants may affect Supervalu\u2019s operating and financial flexibility and may require Supervalu to seek the consent of the lenders for certain transactions that Supervalu may wish to effect. There can be no assurances that Supervalu would be able to obtain such consent. There can also be no assurances that Supervalu will be able to refinance its existing indebtedness on similar terms. Tightening of credit, reduced liquidity or volatility in the capital markets could result in diminished availability of credit and higher costs of borrowing, making it more difficult for Supervalu to obtain or amend debt financing on favorable terms. Additionally, if Supervalu fails to comply with any of its covenants or other restrictions, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and Supervalu may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due. A default under Supervalu\u2019s debt instruments may also significantly affect Supervalu\u2019s ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.\nA significant portion of Supervalu\u2019s debt portfolio has a variable interest rate component. Volatility in interest rates causes volatility in interest expense, potentially resulting in an adverse impact to earnings.\nIncreased healthcare, pension and other costs under Supervalu\u2019s and multiemployer benefit plans, or failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations, could adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSupervalu provides health, defined benefit pension, defined contribution and other postretirement benefits to many of its employees and the costs of such benefits continue to increase. The amount of any increase depends on a number of different factors, many of which are beyond Supervalu\u2019s control. These factors include governmental regulations such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has resulted in changes to the U.S. healthcare system and imposes mandatory types of coverage, reporting and other requirements; return on assets held in plans; changes in actuarial valuations used to determine Supervalu\u2019s benefit obligations for certain benefit plans, which require the use of significant estimates, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs; and for multiemployer plans, the outcome of collective bargaining and actions taken by trustees who manage the plans. If Supervalu is unable to control these benefits and costs, Supervalu may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, Company-sponsored plans and multiemployer pension plans are underfunded with the projected benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of those plans\u2019 assets. Withdrawal liabilities from multiemployer plans could be material, and potential exposure to withdrawal liabilities could cause Supervalu to forgo business opportunities. Many of these plans have required rehabilitation plans or funding improvement plans, and Supervalu can give no assurances of the extent to which a rehabilitation plan or a funding improvement plan will improve the funded status of the plan. Supervalu expects that the unfunded liabilities of these plans will result in increased future payments by Supervalu and the other participating employers over the next few years. A significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The financial condition of these pension plans may also negatively impact Supervalu\u2019s debt ratings, which may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s ability to access one or more financial markets.\nSupervalu is party to collective bargaining agreements that impose certain work rules and other restrictions on Supervalu that limit its flexibility in managing the business and cost structure. See \u201cBusiness-Employees\u201d for information about the collective bargaining agreements. There can be no assurance that Supervalu will be able to negotiate the terms of expiring or expired agreements in a manner acceptable to Supervalu. Therefore, potential increases in operating costs, reduced operational flexibility or work disruptions from labor disputes, strikes or picketing could disrupt Supervalu\u2019s businesses and adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Certain of Supervalu\u2019s operations have employees who are non-union, and while Supervalu believes its employee relations are strong, there can be no assurance that these operations will not experience pressure from labor unions or become the target of campaigns to unionize.\nSupervalu\u2019s success depends in part on the retention of its executive officers and key management, and its ability to hire and retain key personnel.\nSupervalu\u2019s success depends on the experience, performance and skills of its executive officers, senior management and other key employees. Competition for skilled and experienced personnel is intense, and Supervalu\u2019s future success will also depend on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on Supervalu\u2019s operations. There can be no assurance that Supervalu\u2019s executive succession planning, retention or hiring efforts will be successful.\nDisruptions to Supervalu\u2019s or third-party information technology systems, including cyber-attacks and security breaches, and the costs of maintaining secure and effective information technology systems could negatively affect Supervalu\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe efficient operation of Supervalu\u2019s businesses is highly dependent on computer hardware and software systems, including customized information technology systems. Additionally, Supervalu\u2019s businesses increasingly involve the receipt, storage and transmission of sensitive data, including personal information about Supervalu\u2019s customers and employees and proprietary business information of Supervalu and its customers and vendors. Supervalu also shares information with vendors. Information systems are vulnerable to not functioning as designed and to disruptions and security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists.\nIn fiscal 2015, Supervalu experienced separate criminal intrusions into the portion of its computer network that processes payment card transactions for some of its owned and franchised retail food stores, including some of the associated stand-alone liquor stores. Supervalu has incurred and expects to incur costs and expenses related to these intrusions, and may also be adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card brands, Albertson\u2019s LLC and NAI for stores owned and operated by them that experienced related criminal intrusions, stockholders and others and by costly inquiries or enforcement actions on the part of regulatory authorities.\nDespite Supervalu continuing to take actions to strengthen the security of its information technology systems, these measures and technology may not adequately anticipate or prevent security breaches in the future or Supervalu may not be able to timely implement these measures and technology. Cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect. The failure to promptly detect, determine the extent of and appropriately respond to and contain a significant data security attack or breach of the systems of Supervalu or any third party systems used by Supervalu could have a material adverse impact on Supervalu\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Supervalu could also lose credibility with its customers and suffer damage to its reputation and future sales, including through negative publicity and social media. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or failure of these systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such an event, could disrupt Supervalu\u2019s business, impact Supervalu\u2019s customers and could result in decreased performance, increased overhead costs and increased risk for liability, causing Supervalu\u2019s business and results of operations to suffer.\nAs a merchant that accepts debit and credit cards for payment, Supervalu is subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d), issued by the PCI Council. Additionally, Supervalu is subject to PCI DSS as a service provider, which is a business entity that is not a payment brand directly involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of cardholder data. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to Supervalu\u2019s security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting debit cards for payment, Supervalu is also subject to compliance with American National Standards Institute data encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. The cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws, standards and guidelines, including evolving PCI DSS standards, and developing, maintaining and upgrading technology systems to address future advances in technology, could be significant and Supervalu could experience problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems. Failure to comply with such laws, standards and guidelines, or payment card industry standards such as accepting Europay,\nMasterCard, and Visa (EMV) transactions, could have a material adverse impact on Supervalu\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the military commissary system or decreases in governmental funding could negatively impact the sales and operating performance of Supervalu\u2019s military business.\nSupervalu\u2019s Wholesale segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges in the United States. The commissary system is experiencing material changes as the Defense Commissary Agency (\u201cDeCA\u201d) looks to reduce the level of governmental funding required for the system, including to lower prices from suppliers and to offer its own private label products. The military food distribution industry already has narrow operating margins making economies of scale critical for distributors. These changes could have an adverse impact on the sales and operating performance of Supervalu\u2019s military business. Additionally, Supervalu\u2019s military business faces competition from large national and regional food distributors as well as smaller food distributors, and the military commissaries and exchanges face competition from low-cost retailers.\nSupervalu\u2019s insurance and self-insurance programs may not be adequate to cover future claims.\nSupervalu uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities for workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, director and officer liability, property risk, cyber and privacy risks and employee healthcare benefits. Supervalu estimates the liabilities and required reserves associated with the risks retained by Supervalu. Any such estimates and actuarial projection of losses is subject to a degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines, vocation rehabilitation and apportionment and unpredictable external factors affecting inflation rates, discount rates, rising health care costs, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and actual claim settlement patterns. If the number or severity of claims for which Supervalu is self-insured increases, or Supervalu is required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than Supervalu\u2019s original assessments, Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nImpairment charges for long-lived assets or goodwill may adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSupervalu monitors the recoverability of its long-lived assets such as buildings and equipment and evaluates their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Supervalu annually reviews goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews are performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, Supervalu is required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the long-lived assets or goodwill and the fair value of long-lived assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill, respectively, in the period the determination is made. The testing of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment requires Supervalu to make estimates that are subject to significant variability about its future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, weighted average cost of capital, as well as other assumptions. Changes in these estimates, or changes in actual performance compared with these estimates, may affect the fair value of long-lived assets or goodwill, which may result in an impairment charge.\nSupervalu cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSupervalu\u2019s stock price is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile.\nThe market price of Supervalu\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors, some of which may be beyond Supervalu\u2019s control, include the perceived prospects and actual operating results of Supervalu\u2019s business; changes in estimates of Supervalu\u2019s operating results by analysts, investors or Supervalu; trading activity by our large stockholders; trading activity by sophisticated algorithms (high-frequency trading); Supervalu\u2019s actual operating results relative to such estimates or expectations; actions or announcements by Supervalu or its competitors; litigation and judicial decisions; legislative or regulatory actions; and changes in general economic or market conditions. In addition, the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could reduce the market price of Supervalu\u2019s common stock for reasons unrelated to Supervalu\u2019s operating performance.\nEconomic Risks\nChanges in commodity prices, including due to deflation or inflation, or worsening economic conditions could adversely impact Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nPrices for the commodities and supplies that Supervalu purchases can be volatile. Supervalu has more recently experienced continued deflation in commodities that it purchases for resale. Decreases in these input costs have caused Supervalu to lower its prices and thereby reduce its revenues and gross margins. Continued deflation could adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s operating results. Additionally, Supervalu\u2019s operations are dependent on the availability of energy and fuel to store and transport products. While Supervalu has entered into contracts to purchase fuel, electricity and natural gas at fixed prices to satisfy a portion of its expected needs, an increase in these costs could adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s results of operations. Supervalu has also invested in semitrailer trucks powered by compressed natural gas, which operations are subject to risks of defects, malfunctions and other damages.\nThe vast majority of Supervalu\u2019s operations and customers are located in the United States, making its results highly dependent on U.S. economic conditions including consumer confidence and spending habits. Further, a significant portion of Supervalu\u2019s total sales for its Retail operations is derived from stores located in Minnesota, Missouri and the Washington D.C./Baltimore market, resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states. There can be no assurance that Supervalu will be able to identify and respond effectively to changing economic conditions and trends. Additionally, these economic conditions can increase Supervalu\u2019s cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s results of operations.\nSevere weather and natural disasters may harm Supervalu\u2019s business.\nSevere weather conditions and natural disasters in areas in which Supervalu or its customers operate or from which Supervalu obtains products may adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of physical damage to Supervalu\u2019s properties, closure of one or more of Supervalu\u2019s or its customers\u2019 stores, offices or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of products, disruption in the transport of goods, delays in the delivery of goods to distribution centers or stores, a reduction in customer volume and a reduction in the availability of products. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops yielded by food producers may adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within the grocery supply chain.\nDisruption to Supervalu\u2019s supply chain and distribution network could have an adverse impact on Supervalu\u2019s sales and results of operations.\nSupervalu\u2019s sales and operating results could be adversely impacted if Supervalu is not able to provide goods and services to Supervalu and its customers in a timely and cost-effective manner. Factors that may disrupt Supervalu\u2019s ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply chain and distribution network include adverse climate conditions, product recalls, crop conditions, availability of key commodities, regulatory actions, disruptions in technology, political or financial instability of suppliers, performance by outsourced service providers, transportation interruptions, labor supply or stoppages or vendor defaults or disputes, as well as other risk factors mentioned herein, any of which could also have an adverse effect on Supervalu\u2019s sales and operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nSupervalu\u2019s businesses are subject to laws and governmental regulations that could adversely impact Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSupervalu\u2019s businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices that require Supervalu to comply with numerous provisions regulating areas such as environmental, health and sanitation standards, food safety, marketing of natural or organically produced food, facilities, pharmacies, equal employment opportunity, public accessibility, employee benefits, wages and hours worked and licensing for the sale of food, drugs and alcoholic beverages, among others. For example:\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety: Supervalu\u2019s operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, the disposal of food by-products, the handling, treatment and disposal of wastes, maintenance of refrigeration systems and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Compliance with existing or changing environmental and safety requirements, including more stringent limitations imposed or expected to be imposed in recently renewed or soon-to-be renewed environmental permits, may require capital expenditures.\nFood Safety: There is increasing governmental scrutiny, regulations and public awareness regarding food quality and food and drug safety. Supervalu may be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of Supervalu\u2019s food and drug products. Any events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination, drug contamination or food-borne illness or injury, or events that give rise to claims that Supervalu\u2019s products are not of the quality or composition claimed to be, may result in product liability claims from individuals, consumers and governmental agencies, penalties and enforcement actions from government agencies, a loss of consumer confidence, harm to Supervalu\u2019s reputation and could cause production and delivery disruptions, which may adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. It may be necessary for Supervalu to recall unsafe, contaminated or defective products or Supervalu may recall products that it determines do not satisfy its quality standards. Recall costs and product liability claims can be material. While Supervalu generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from its suppliers, it might not be able to recover these significant costs from its suppliers.\nPharmacy: Supervalu is required to meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, record keeping and distribution of controlled substances. During the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audits at both the federal and state levels. For example, see Note 15-Commitments, Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of the administrative subpoena issued to Supervalu by the DEA requesting, among other things, information on Supervalu\u2019s pharmacy policies and procedures generally as well as the production of documents that are required to be kept and maintained by Supervalu pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and to reimbursement. One of these changes was to revise the definition of the Average Manufacturer Price, a pricing element common to most payment formulas, and the reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs. This change will affect Supervalu\u2019s reimbursement. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act made other changes that affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of Supervalu\u2019s health plan clients, including the requirement for health insurers to meet a minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebates to enrollees. These Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act changes may not affect Supervalu\u2019s business directly, but they could indirectly impact Supervalu\u2019s services and/or business practices.\nWage Rates and Paid Leave: Changes in federal or state minimum wage and overtime laws or employee paid leave laws could cause Supervalu to incur additional wage costs, which could adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s operating margins.\nForeign Operations: Supervalu\u2019s supplier base includes domestic and foreign suppliers. Accordingly, political or financial instability in these foreign countries, changes in U.S. and foreign relationships, laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations could adversely impact Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Supervalu is required to comply with laws and regulations governing ethical, anti-bribery and similar business practices such as the Foreign Correct Practices Act. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an effect on our future costs or on future cash flows from our foreign operations, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with government laws and regulations or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance with governmental laws and regulations may adversely impact Supervalu\u2019s business operations and prospects for future growth and its ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs and may also result in monetary liabilities, claims, fines, penalties or other sanctions and may adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. Supervalu cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can Supervalu determine the effect that additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on Supervalu\u2019s future business.\nSupervalu\u2019s businesses may become subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSupervalu\u2019s businesses are subject to the risk of legal proceedings by employees, unions, consumers, customers, suppliers, stockholders, debt holders, governmental agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation or proceeding. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in Supervalu\u2019s businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether Supervalu is ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect Supervalu\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.

In particular, increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals (which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drugs) has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to Supervalu\u2019s pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in Supervalu\u2019s generic profit rate. Additionally, there has been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry, and it is possible that this and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceuticals and diminish Supervalu\u2019s ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs. The increase in preferred pharmacy networks has also had a negative impact on pharmacy reimbursement rates. Any inability to offset increased costs or to modify Supervalu\u2019s activities to lessen the impact could have an adverse effect on Supervalu\u2019s results of operations.\nSupervalu may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, which could harm Supervalu\u2019s business.\nSupervalu relies on a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright and domain name law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect its intellectual property. Supervalu believes its trademarks, private label products and domain names are valuable assets. However, Supervalu\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to distinguish Supervalu\u2019s products and services from those of its competitors and to provide Supervalu with a competitive advantage. From time to time, third parties may use names, logos and slogans similar to Supervalu\u2019s, may apply to register trademarks or domain names similar to Supervalu\u2019s, and may infringe or otherwise violate Supervalu\u2019s intellectual property rights. Supervalu\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted against such third parties or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Asserting or defending Supervalu\u2019s intellectual property rights could be time consuming and costly and could distract management\u2019s attention and resources. If Supervalu is unable to prevent its competitors from using names, logos, slogans and domain names similar to Supervalu\u2019s, consumer confusion could result, the perception of Supervalu\u2019s brands and products could be negatively affected, and Supervalu\u2019s sales and profitability could suffer as a result. In addition, if Supervalu\u2019s Wholesale customers receive negative publicity or fail to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with Supervalu\u2019s trademarks, Supervalu\u2019s rights to, and the value of, its trademarks could potentially be harmed. Failure to protect Supervalu\u2019s proprietary information could also have an adverse effect on its business.\nSupervalu may also be subject to claims that its activities or the products it sells infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management\u2019s attention and resources, even if the claims are without merit, and may prevent Supervalu from using its trademarks in certain geographies or in connection with certain products and services, any of which could have an adverse effect on Supervalu\u2019s business.", "PERMNO": 44951, "SIC": 5141, "TIC": "SVU"}
