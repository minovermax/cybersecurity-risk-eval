RISK FACTORS\nThere are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern without additional financing. If such financing is not available to us or is not available to us on acceptable terms, we may be forced to cease operations.\nOur current financial position does not provide sufficient operating cash flow to support our activities and our business requires constant additional investment and adaptation. For the year ended December 31, 2104, we had a net loss of approximately $1,802,000 and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $859,000. In addition, we had a working capital deficiency of approximately $3,099,000 and an accumulated deficit of $2,345,000 as of December 31, 2014. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur current financial position does not provide sufficient operating cash flow to support our activities and our business requires constant additional investment and adaptation.\nOur operations of have been funded primarily through sales of stock to private investors, debt financing, and exchange of common stock for services received by us. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct business. If we are not able to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development of our Commercial Services business or cease operations entirely.\nWe need to maintain current sources of funding and obtain new sources of funding in order to continue our operations.\nWe currently do not have enough cash to continue our operations without additional sources of funding. Our ability to continue operations is highly dependent on our; (i) continued access to our credit lines with Action Capital and Cantone Asset Management, LLC, (ii) increasing cash flows generated from operations, and (iii) ability to obtain alternative financing. In the event there is an unexpected downturn in our business or we are unable to obtain additional financing, we would need to modify our debt agreements, and/or curtail operations. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned operating goals nor give any assurance of our ability to obtain an adequate level of alternative financing. Moreover, any issuance of equity or equity-linked securities could result in significant dilution to our existing shareholders.\nWe currently have a number of on-demand liabilities that could be called at any time.\nWe currently have a significant amount of on-demand liabilities outstanding comprised of principal balances on notes which remain outstanding beyond maturity dates and past-due general unsecured payables. If any significant amount of such liabilities were called, we would not be able to repay them and we would be in default. IF a sufficient number of liabilities were called concurrently, we could be forced to cease operations.\nIf we are not able to continue to innovate or if we fail to adapt to changes in our industry, may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new service and product introductions and changing customer demands. Although we have developed new products and services in order to meet customer demand, new technologies and evolving business models continue to develop at a fast pace and we may not be able to keep up with all of the changes. Several competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. The changes and developments taking place in our industry may also require us to re-evaluate our business model and adopt significant changes to our long-term strategies and business plan. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, programs and technologies, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\nWe rely upon third parties to host certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of such third party services would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\nWe make use of a number of services provided by third parties, including distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a cloud computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by such third parties. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our operations to other providers, any disruption of or interference with our use of current service providers would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if our data were to be accessed by unauthorized persons.\nWe maintain personal data regarding users of our services, including names and, in many cases, mailing addresses. With respect to billing data, such as credit card numbers, we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our data. If, despite these measures, we, or our payment processing services, experience any unauthorized intrusion into our data, we could face legal claims, and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, fair trade practice, patent, copyright and trade secret protection laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property rights. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and any third parties who may access our proprietary information, and we rigorously control access to our proprietary technology and information.\nIntellectual property protection may not be sufficient and confidentiality agreements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights. In addition, policing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, time-consuming and costly and the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property. In the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managerial and financial resources. We can provide no assurance that we would prevail in such litigation. In addition, our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. Any failure in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web site, technology, title selection processes and marketing activities.\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content. We use the intellectual property of third-parties in our products through contractual and other rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business. We have not searched all the patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\nIf we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nWe may make additional acquisitions in the future. If we make acquisitions, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired companies\u2019 personnel and operations with our own. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf the difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;\n\u25cf the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u25cf the difficulty of incorporating acquired rights or products into our existing business;\n\u25cf difficulties in disposing of the excess or idle facilities of an acquired company or business and expenses in maintaining such facilities;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u25cf the potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross-marketing of the products to new and existing customers;\n\u25cf the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired; and\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired products or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with these acquisitions, many of which cannot be presently identified, these risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf the FCC puts regulation in place to limit the amount that we can charge for our services, our revenues could be reduced.\nRecently, the Federal Communication Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) has been investigating certain of our competitors in connection with the rates charged for their services. Although no final determination has yet been made by the FCC, it is possible that the FCC will take action to regulate the amount that we and our competitors can charge for our services. If the FCC does choose to regulate our services, it could limit the amount that we are able to charge for our services and our revenues could be reduced.\nIf we are not able to manage our growth, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are currently engaged in an effort to grow our service by introducing new products and services and expanding the areas we conduct business. As we undertake all these changes, if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nSecurities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as the factors listed below, some of which are beyond our control, could affect the market price of our common stock:\n\u00b7 trading volumes;\n\u00b7 our failure to achieve actual operating results that meet or exceed guidance that we may have provided due to factors beyond our control, such as currency volatility;\n\u00b7 future announcements concerning us or our competitors, including the announcement of acquisitions;\n\u00b7 changes in government regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or licensure;\n\u00b7 public perceptions of risks associated with our services or operations;\n\u00b7 developments in our industry; and\n\u00b7 general economic, market and political conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, investors will benefit from their investment in our common stock only if our common stock appreciates in value.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation and growth of our business and do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. Our common stock may not appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors in this offering have purchased their shares.\nWe may not be able to enhance our existing products to address the needs of other markets.\nThe first step on realizing our business development strategy requires us to enhance current products so they can meet the needs of other markets. If we are unable to do this, we may not be able to increase our sales and further develop our business.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, we have had weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to lack of executive officers or directors other than the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer with significant experience in accounting, auditing and the preparation of financial statements. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe that such weaknesses have been substantially remediated through, among other things, Richard Stewart, who has an accounting background, being appointed to our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, we may in the future need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. In addition, when evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.", "PERMNO": 69244, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LTTC"}
