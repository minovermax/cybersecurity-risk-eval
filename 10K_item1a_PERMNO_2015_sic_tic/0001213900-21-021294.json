RISK FACTORS.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic is not effectively controlled in a short period of time, our business operation and financial condition in the long-term may be materially and adversely affected as a result of any slowdown in economic growth, operation disruptions or other factors that we cannot predict.\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has caused different countries and cities to mandate curfews, including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and closures of most non-essential businesses as well as other measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. All of our operating subsidiaries are located in China. All of our employees and substantially all of our customers and suppliers are also located in China. The pandemic caused disruptions to our operations during the first quarter of 2020 and our business and operations fully resumed during the second quarter of 2020. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our operations, it has had limited adverse impacts on our operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. We generated revenues of $37.6 million and $22.2 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had a net loss of $7.8 million and $10.9 million in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. However, the extent of the long-term adverse impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations is highly uncertain and depends on several factors, such as the duration, severity, and geographic spread of the pandemic, development of the testing and treatment and stimulus measures of the government, all of which are out of our control.\nGiven the uncertainty of the outbreak, the spread of COVID-19 may be prolonged and worsened, and we may be forced to scale back or even suspend our operations. As COVID-19 spreads outside China, the global economy is suffering a noticeable slowdown. As this outbreak persists, commercial activities throughout the world have been curtailed with decreased consumer spending, business operation disruptions, interrupted supply chain, difficulties in travel and reduced workforces. The duration and intensity of disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain. It is unclear as to when the outbreak will be contained, and we also cannot predict if the impact will be short-lived or long-lasting. The extent to which outbreak impacts our long-term financial results will depend on its future developments. If the COVID-19 pandemic is not effectively controlled in a short period of time, our long-term business operation and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected as a result of any slowdown in economic growth, operation disruptions or other factors that we cannot predict.\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued in connection with our financial statements included in this annual report which states that the financial statements were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, we had a working capital deficiency, accumulated deficit from recurring losses and short-term debt obligations as of December 31, 2020. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to renew our bank borrowings upon maturity and raise additional funds through bank borrowings and equity financing to meet our daily cash demands. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the financing. The audited consolidated financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThere are inherent risks associated with new product development and our efforts to develop and market new products could fail.\nIn June 2020, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BAK Asia entered into a framework investment agreement with Gaochun EDZ, pursuant to which intend to develop certain lithium battery projects which are expected to have a total production capacity of 8 GWh per year. We are currently developing certain new products including model 32140 large-sized cylindrical \u201ctabless\u201d batteries and anticipate to complete the construction of a production line of model 32140 battery with the projected production capacity of 0.7 GWh per year in 2021. Model 32140 batteries can be used in light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools and energy storage.\nHowever, we cannot provide assurance that market acceptance of this new product will occur due to the highly competitive nature of the business. The Company competes in the battery industry where there are frequent introductions of new products and line extensions and such product introductions often require significant investment and support. The ability of the Company to understand end user needs and preferences is key to maintaining and improving the competitiveness of its product offerings. The development and introduction of new products, as well as the renovation of current products and product lines, require substantial and effective research, development and marketing expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recoup if the new or renovated products do not gain widespread market acceptance. There are inherent risks associated with new product development and marketing efforts, including product development or launch delays, product performance issues during development, changing regulatory frameworks that affect the new products in development and the availability of key raw materials included in such products. These inherent risks could result in the failure of new products and product line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, additional costs resulting from failed product introductions and the Company not being first to market. As the Company continues to focus on innovation and renovation of its products, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that the Company is not able to effectively develop and introduce new or renovated products and line or brand extensions.\nOur failure, if any, to keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards may cause our products to become obsolete and less marketable, resulting in loss of market share to our competitors.\nThe lithium-based battery market is characterized by changing technologies and evolving industry standards, which are difficult to predict. This, coupled with frequent introduction of new products and models, has shortened product life cycles and may render our products obsolete or unmarketable. Our ability to adapt to evolving industry standards and anticipate future standards will be a significant factor in maintaining and improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. To achieve this goal, we have invested and plan to continue investing significant financial resources in our R&D infrastructure. Currently, we have a facility in Dalian, China, which has about 80 engineers and over 4,000 square meters of space dedicated to R&D activities.\nR&D activities, however, are inherently uncertain, and we might encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results. Accordingly, our significant investment in our R&D infrastructure may not bear fruit. On the other hand, our competitors may improve their technologies or even achieve technological breakthroughs that would render our products obsolete or less marketable. Therefore, our failure to effectively keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards by introducing new and enhanced products may cause us to lose our market share and to suffer a decrease in our revenue.\nOur efforts to enter into the light electric vehicle business could fail.\nOn September 24, 2020, our wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, BAK Investments entered into a framework investment agreement with Gaochun EDZ, under which we intended to develop light electric vehicle projects. On November 9, 2020, we established our new subsidiary, Nanjing Daxin to launch and develop our light electric vehicle business.\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with this effort, particularly given that the light electric vehicle market is evolving. In developing and commercializing this new line of business, we may have to invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives, lack of market acceptance and shifting market preferences, may also affect the successful implementation of this new line of business. Failure to successfully plan for and manage these risks in the development and implementation of this new line of business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining our R&D activities and manufacturing operations require significant capital expenditures, and our inability or failure to maintain our operations could have a material adverse impact on our market share and ability to generate revenue.\nWe incurred capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 million and $17.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We may incur significant additional capital expenditures as a result of unanticipated expenses, regulatory changes and other events that impact our business. If we are unable or fail to timely obtain capital on acceptable terms and adequately maintain our manufacturing capacity, we could lose customers and there could be a material adverse impact on our market share and our ability to generate revenue.\nWe face intense competition from other battery manufacturers, many of which have significantly greater resources.\nThe market for batteries used in electric vehicles and light electric vehicles is intensely competitive and is characterized by frequent technological changes and evolving industry standards. We expect competition to become more intense. Increased competition may result in declines in average selling prices, causing a decrease in gross profit margins. We have faced and will continue to face competition from manufacturers of traditional rechargeable batteries, such as lead-acid batteries other manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries, as well as from companies engaged in the development of batteries incorporating new technologies. Other manufacturers of high-power lithium batteries currently include Panasonic Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., LG Chem, Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint Stock Co., Ltd., Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited, BYD Co. Ltd, Hefei Guoxuan Hi-Tech Power Energy Co., Ltd and Shandong Goldencell Electronics Technology Co., Ltd.\nMany of these existing competitors have greater financial, personnel, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to market opportunities, new or emerging technologies and evolving industry standards. Many of our competitors are developing a variety of battery technologies, such as lithium polymer, prismatic cells and fuel cell batteries, which are expected to compete with our existing product lines. Other companies undertaking R&D activities of solid-polymer lithium-ion batteries have developed prototypes and are constructing commercial scale production facilities. It is possible that our competitors will be able to introduce new products with more desirable features than ours and their new products will gain market acceptance. If our competitors successfully do so, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position and our future success would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues and this dependence is likely to continue.\nWe have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 79.45% and 77.59% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Dependence on a few customers could make it difficult to negotiate attractive prices for our products and could expose us to the risk of substantial losses if a single dominant customer stops purchasing our products. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to contribute a significant portion of our sales in the near future. Our ability to maintain close relationships with these top customers is essential to the growth and profitability of our business. If we fail to sell our products to one or more of these top customers in any particular period, or if a large customer purchases fewer of our products, defers orders or fails to place additional orders with us, or if we fail to develop additional major customers, our revenue could decline, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to our own production, we also rely on a few battery suppliers to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders. If we fail to effectively manage our relationships with, or lose the services of these suppliers and we cannot substitute suitable alternative suppliers, our operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe generate part of our revenues by outsourcing some of our customers\u2019 orders to Zhengzhou BAK New Energy Vehicle Co., Ltd (\u201cBAK New Energy\u201d), Shenzhen BAK Battery Co., Ltd (\u201cShenzhen BAK\u201d) and a few other suppliers for certain battery models that we do not produce. If our business relationship with BAK New Energy, Shenzhen BAK and other suppliers changes negatively or their financial condition deteriorates, or their operating environment changes, our business may be harmed in many ways. BAK New Energy, Shenzhen BAK and other suppliers may also unilaterally terminate battery supply to us or increase the prices. As a result, we are not assured of an uninterrupted supply of certain types of high-power lithium batteries of acceptable quality or at acceptable prices from BAK New Energy, Shenzhen BAK or other suppliers. On the other hand, we may not be able to substitute them with suitable alternative contract manufacturers in a timely manner on commercially acceptable term or at all. We may be forced to default on the agreements with our customers. This may negatively impact our revenues and adversely affect our reputation and relationships with our customers, causing a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business depends on the growth in demand for light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage, such as UPS application, and other high-power electric devices.\nAs the demand for our battery products is directly related to the market demand for high-power electric devices, a fast-growing high-power electric devices market will be critical to the success of our business. In anticipation of an expected increase in the demand for high-power electric devices such as electric vehicles, light electric vehicles, electric tools, and energy storage including UPS application in the next few years, we are building new manufacturing facilities in Nanjing. However, the markets we have targeted, primarily those in the PRC, may not achieve the level of growth we expect. If this market fails to achieve our expected level of growth, we may have excess production capacity and may not be able to generate enough revenue to obtain our profitability.\nOur success, in part, depends on the success of manufacturers of the end applications that use our products, and our failure to gain acceptance of our products from such manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nAs we target the battery markets for light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, energy storage including but not limited to UPS application, and other high-power electric devices, our future success in part depends on whether end-application manufacturers are willing to use batteries that incorporate our products. To secure acceptance of our products, we must constantly develop and introduce more reliable and cost-effective battery cells with enhanced functionality to meet evolving industry standards. Our failure to gain acceptance of our products from these manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our future success. From 2017 to 2019, our electric vehicle customers included Dongfeng Autos, Dayun Motor and Yema Auto. Since then, however, our sales to electric vehicle customers have decreased significantly and we only generated approximately $0.3 million revenues from electric vehicle customers in 2020.\nEven if a manufacturer decides to use batteries that incorporate our products, the manufacturer may not be able to market and sell its products successfully. The manufacturer\u2019s inability to market and sell its products successfully, whether from lack of market acceptance or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects because this manufacturer may not order new products from us. If we cannot achieve the expected level of sales, we will not be able to make sufficient profits to offset the expenditures we have incurred to expand our production capacity, nor will we be able to grow our business. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future success would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to declining average selling prices of the end applications that may use our products, which may harm our revenue and gross profits.\nThe end applications that may incorporate our products such as light electric vehicles, electric vehicles, electric tools, and energy storage including but not limited to UPS application are subject to declines in average selling prices due to rapidly evolving technologies, industry standards and consumer preferences. As a result, manufacturers of these electronic devices expect us as suppliers to cut our costs and lower the price of our products in order to mitigate the negative impact on their own margins. We have reduced the price of some of our electric bike batteries in the past in order to meet market demand and expect to continue to face market-driven downward pricing pressures in the future. Our revenue and profitability will suffer if we are unable to offset any declines in our average selling prices by developing new or enhanced products with higher selling prices or gross profit margins, increasing our sales volumes or reducing our costs on a timely basis.\nWe extend relatively long payment terms to some large customers.\nAs is customary in our industry in the PRC, we extend relatively long payment terms to some large customers. In 2020, it generally took 90 days for us to collect payments from our major customers. Due to the large size of many of our orders, these extended terms may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to fund our operations out of our operating cash flows.\nWhile our revenue grew by $15.4 million, or 69% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, our trade accounts and bills receivable increased by $21.6 million, or 272% as of December 31, 2020 compared to that as of December 31, 2019. Although we attempt to establish appropriate reserves for our receivables, those reserves may not prove to be adequate in view of large amounts of accounts receivable and actual levels of bad debts. The failure of our customers to pay us timely would negatively affect our working capital, which could in turn adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur customers often place large orders for products, requiring fast delivery, which impacts our working capital. If our customers do not incorporate our products into their products and sell them in a timely fashion, for example, due to excess inventories, sales slowdowns or other issues, they may not pay us in a timely fashion, even on our extended terms. Our customers\u2019 failure to pay may force us to defer or delay further product orders, which may adversely affect our cash flows, sales or income in subsequent periods.\nWe may not be able to accurately plan our production based on our sales contracts, which may result in excess product inventory or product shortages.\nOur sales contracts typically provide for a non-binding, three-month forecast on the quantity of products that our customers may purchase from us. We typically have only a 15-day to 30-day lead time to manufacture products to meet our customers\u2019 requirements once our customers place orders with us. To meet the short delivery deadline, we generally make significant decisions on our production level and timing, procurement, facility requirements, personnel needs and other resources requirements based on our estimate in light of this forecast, our past dealings with such customers, market conditions and other relevant factors. Our customers\u2019 final purchase orders may not be consistent with our estimates. If the final purchase orders substantially differ from our estimates, we may have excess product inventory or product shortages. Excess product inventory could result in unprofitable sales or write-offs as our products are susceptible to obsolescence and price declines. Producing additional products to make up for any product shortages within a short time frame may be difficult, making us unable to fill out the purchase orders. In either case, our results of operation would fluctuate from period to period.\nWe may not be able to substantially increase our manufacturing output in order to maintain our cost competitiveness.\nWe believe that our ability to provide cost-effective products is one of the most significant factors that contributed to our past success and will be essential for our future growth. We believe this is one of our competitive advantages over our Japanese and Korean competitors. We need to increase our manufacturing output to a level that will enable us to substantially reduce the cost of our products on a per unit basis through economies of scale. However, our ability to substantially increase our manufacturing output is subject to significant constraints and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf the need to raise significant additional funds to purchase and prepay raw materials or to build additional manufacturing facilities, which we may be unable to obtain on reasonable terms or at all;\n\u25cf delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which may be beyond our control, such as increases in raw material prices and problems with equipment vendors;\n\u25cf delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities;\n\u25cf diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and\n\u25cf failure to execute our expansion plan effectively.\nIf we are unable to increase our manufacturing output because of any of the risks described above, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position or achieve the growth we expect. Moreover, even if we expand our manufacturing output, we may not be able to generate sufficient customer demand for our products to support our increased production output.\nWe may incur significant costs because of the warranties we supply with our products and services.\nWith respect to the sale of our battery products, we typically offer warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period of six months-to-eight years from the date of purchase, including a period of six to twenty-four months for battery cells, and a period of twelve to twenty-seven months for battery modules for electric bicycles, and a period of three years to eight years (or 120,000 or 200,000 km if reached sooner) for battery modules for electric vehicles. We provide a reserve for these potential warranty expenses, which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues. There is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history, and in the event that we experience a significant increase in warranty claims, there is no assurance that our reserves will be sufficient. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have insurance coverage against damages or losses of our products. Defects in our products could result in a loss of customers and decrease in revenue, unexpected expenses and a loss of market share.\nWe have not purchased product liability insurance to provide against any claims against us based on our product quality. As a result, defects in our products could result in a loss of customers and decrease in revenue, unexpected expenses and a loss of market share, and any of our products are found to have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we will be required to accept returns, provide replacements, provide refunds, or pay damages. We may be required to incur substantial amounts to indemnify our customers in respect of their product quality claims against us, which would materially and adversely affect the results of our operations and severely damage our reputation.\nWe do not have insurance coverage against all the damages or losses of our facilities.\nWe currently have insurance coverage for certain pledged machinery and equipment and pledged buildings located at our facilities. We expect we will purchase related insurance for the remaining buildings when we obtain their property ownership certificates. If we were to suffer any losses or damages to any of the facilities before the purchase of insurance policies that provide adequate coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on third parties to supply key raw materials and components to us. Failure to obtain a sufficient supply of these raw materials and components in a timely fashion and at reasonable costs could significantly delay our production and shipments, which would cause us to breach our sales contracts with our customers.\nWe purchase from Chinese domestic suppliers for certain key raw materials and components such as electrolytes, electrode materials and separators. We have purchased raw materials and components on the basis of purchase orders. In the absence of firm and long-term contracts, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of these raw materials and components from our existing suppliers or alternates in a timely fashion or at a reasonable cost. If we fail to secure a sufficient supply of key raw materials and components in a timely fashion, it would result in a significant delay in our production and shipments, which may cause us to breach our sales contracts with our customers. Furthermore, failure to obtain sufficient supply of these raw materials and components at a reasonable cost could also harm our revenue and gross profit margins.\nFluctuations in prices and availability of raw materials, particularly Ni, Co, Mn, Li2CO3, LiPF6 and LiFePO4, could increase our costs or cause delays in shipments, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur operating results could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, particularly Ni, Co, Mn, Li2CO3, LiPF6 and LiFePO4, the primary cost component of our battery products, or other product parts or components. The price of Ni, Co, Mn, Li2CO3, LiPF6 and LiFePO4 is not stable. If the price increases, it will negatively impact our financial results in years ahead. We historically have not been able to fully offset the effects of higher costs of raw materials through price increases to customers or by way of productivity improvements. As a result, a significant increase in the price of one or more raw materials, parts or components or the inability to successfully implement price increases/ surcharges to mitigate such cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe experience fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and likely will fluctuate in the future. The demand for our products is driven largely by the demand for the end-product applications that are powered by our products. Accordingly, the rechargeable battery industry is affected by market conditions that are often outside our control. Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a number of factors, including seasonal variations in customers\u2019 demand for batteries and their end applications, capacity ramp up by competitors, industry-wide technological changes, the loss of a key customer and the postponement, rescheduling or cancellation of large orders by a key customer. As a result of these factors and other risks discussed in this section, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon to predict our future performance.\nWe do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which may result in significant uncertainties and volatility with respect to our revenue from period to period.\nWe do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers and the term of our sales contracts with our customers is typically one year or less. Furthermore, these contracts leave certain major terms such as price and quantity of products open to be determined in each purchase order. These contracts also allow parties to re-adjust the contract price for substantial changes in market conditions. As a result, if our customers hold stronger bargaining power than us or the market conditions are in their favor, we may not be able to enjoy the price downside protection or upside gain. Furthermore, our customers may decide not to continue placing purchase orders with us in the future at the same level as in prior periods. As a result, our results of operations may vary from period to period and may fluctuate significantly in the future.\nWe face risks associated with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products internationally, and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair our ability to expand our business abroad.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived 5.6% and 2.5%, respectively, of our sales from outside the PRC mainland. We still deem overseas market as an important revenue source for us, and have been actively exploring overseas customers. The marketing, international distribution and sale of our products expose us to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf difficulty in engaging and retaining distributors that are knowledgeable about, and can function effectively in, overseas markets;\n\u25cf increased costs associated with maintaining marketing efforts in various countries;\n\u25cf difficulty and cost relating to compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas markets in which we offer our products;\n\u25cf inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries.\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lost their services.\nOur future success heavily depends on the continued service of our senior executives and other key employees. In particular, we rely on the expertise and experience of our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President Mr. Yunfei Li and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Xiangyu Pei. If one or more of our other senior executives are unable or unwilling to continue to work for us in their present positions, we may encounter similar problems, but on a compounded basis. Moreover, if any of our current or former senior executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Each of our executive officers has entered into an employment agreement with us, which contains non-competition and confidentiality clauses. However, if any dispute arises between our current or former executive officers and the Company, it is hard to predict the extent to which any of these agreements could be enforced in China, where these executive officers reside, in light of the uncertainties with China\u2019s legal system.\nWe have experienced significant management changes which could increase our control risks and have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business and our results of operations.\nSince 2009, we have had a number of changes in our senior management, including multiple changes in our Chief Financial Officer. The magnitude of these past and potential changes and the short time interval in which they have occurred or may occur, particularly during a time of economic or financial crisis, add to the risks of control failures, including a failure in the effective operation of our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. Control failures could result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. It may take time for the new management team to become sufficiently familiar with our business and each other to effectively develop and implement our business strategies. The turnover of key management positions could further harm our financial performance and results of operations. Management attention may be diverted from regular business concerns by reorganizations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to remediate the material weaknesses or maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our shares may be adversely affected.\nTo implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX 404, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K. Under current law, we are subject to the requirement that we maintain internal controls and that management perform periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal controls, assuming our filing status remains as a smaller reporting company. A report of our management is included under Item 9A of this annual report. Our management has identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: we did not have appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements, and there was insufficient accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have taken measures and plan to continue to take measures to remedy this material weakness. Since September 2016, we have regularly offered our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. Since November 2016, we have regularly provided trainings to our financial personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. However, the implementation of these measures may not fully address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Our failure to address any control deficiency could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting is important to prevent fraud. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our shares, may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur auditors, based in Hong Kong, China, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China and to the extent their audit clients have operations in China, is not permitted to be subject to full inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. In addition, as a result of the enactment of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, we could be delisted if we were unable to cure the situation to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time.\nOur independent registered public accounting firms that issued the audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the SEC, as auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB, are required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess their compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. However, our operations are solely located in the PRC, a jurisdiction where PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities. Our independent registered public accounting firm, like others operating in China (and Hong Kong, to the extent their audit clients have operations in China), is currently not subject to inspection conducted by the PCAOB. Inspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct full inspections of auditors operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate our auditors\u2019 audit procedures or quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections.\nIn December 2012, the SEC instituted proceedings under Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the SEC\u2019s Rules of Practice against five PRC-based accounting firms, alleging that these firms had violated U.S. securities laws and the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations thereunder by failing to provide to the SEC the firms\u2019 work papers related to their audits of certain PRC-based companies that are publicly traded in the United States. Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) grants to the SEC the authority to deny to any person, temporarily or permanently, the ability to practice before the SEC who is found by the SEC, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any such laws or rules and regulations. On January 22, 2014, an initial administrative law decision was issued, sanctioning four of these accounting firms and suspending them from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The sanction will not take effect until there is an order of effectiveness issued by the SEC. In February 2014, four of these PRC-based accounting firms filed a petition for review of the initial decision. In February 2015, each of these four accounting firms agreed to a censure and to pay fine to the SEC to settle the dispute with the SEC. The settlement stays the current proceeding for four years, during which time the firms are required to follow detailed procedures to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms\u2019 audit documents via the CSRC. If a firm does not follow the procedures, the SEC would impose penalties such as suspensions, or commence a new, expedited administrative proceeding against the non-compliant firm or it could restart the administrative proceeding against all four firms. The four-year mark occurred on February 6, 2019.\nAs part of a continued regulatory focus in the United States on access to audit and other information currently protected by national law, in particular China\u2019s, on December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law. This act amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to direct the SEC to prohibit securities of any registrant from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges or traded \u201cover-the-counter\u201d if the auditor of the registrant\u2019s financial statements is not subject to PCAOB inspection for three consecutive years after the law becomes effective. On March 24, 2021, SEC announced it has adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure requirements of the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Forms 10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction. As a result, we could be delisted if we are unable to cure the situation to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time.\nWe may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation against us in China.\nAs described in detail under Note 23 (ii) to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report, in recent years, we have been subject to an array of lawsuits in China, most of which arose out of failure to make timely payments pursuant to contracts with our suppliers, vendors or contractors. As a result, we and our Chief Executive Officer, Yunfei Li, are subject to court orders restricting high spending. Such orders, among others, prohibit us from investing in or building high-end properties but allow us to construct production facilities.\nWe believe that some of plaintiffs\u2019 claims in the above lawsuits are without merit and we are vigorously defending ourselves. There is no assurance that we will be successful in the lawsuits. In the event that plaintiffs prevail in the lawsuit, unfavorable court judgment could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA\nChanges in the economic and political policies of the PRC government could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe conduct substantially all our business operations in China. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition and prospects are significantly dependent on economic and political developments in China. China\u2019s economy differs from the economies of developed countries in many aspects, including the level of development, growth rate and degree of government control over foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While China\u2019s economy has experienced significant growth in the past 30 years, the growth has been uneven across different regions and periods and among various economic sectors in China. We cannot assure you that China\u2019s economy will continue to grow, or that if there is growth, such growth will be steady and uniform, or that if there is a slowdown, such slowdown will not have a negative effect on its business and results of operations.\nThe PRC government exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, control over payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, implementation of monetary policy, and preferential treatment of particular industries or companies. Certain measures adopted by the PRC government may restrict loans to certain industries, such as changes in the statutory deposit reserve ratio and lending guidelines for commercial banks by the People\u2019s Bank of China, or PBOC. These current and future government actions could materially affect our liquidity, access to capital, and ability to operate our business.\nThe global financial markets experienced significant disruptions in 2008 and the United States, Europe and other economies went into recession. Since 2012, growth of the Chinese economy has slowed down. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy but may also have a negative effect on us. Our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. In addition, any stimulus measures designed to boost the Chinese economy, may contribute to higher inflation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in China. Our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference, but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties for you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Moreover, most of our executive officers and directors are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our Chinese operations and subsidiaries.\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nWe rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs.\nWe are a holding company, and we conduct all of our operations through our PRC subsidiaries. We rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our stockholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. Current regulations in the PRC permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. According to the articles of association of our PRC subsidiaries, each of our PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on the PRC accounting standards and regulations each year to its statutory general reserve, until the balance in the reserve reaches 50% of the registered capital of the company. Funds in the reserve are not distributable to us in forms of cash dividends, loans or advances. In addition, if our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us, which in turn will adversely affect our available cash. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively.\nThe majority of our sales will be settled in RMB, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB in the future.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our securities will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the investment in offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us.\nOn July 14, 2014, SAFE issued the Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Residents\u2019 Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (\u201cCircular 37\u201d), which replaced the Circular 75, promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d\nWe have notified substantial beneficial owners of our company who we know are PRC residents to comply with the registration obligation. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 37 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe M&A Rule establishes more complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, promulgated the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006. The M&A Rule establishes additional procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the PRC Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction and in some situations, require approval of the PRC Ministry of Commerce when a foreign investor takes control of a Chinese domestic enterprise. The regulations prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the PRC business or assets and in certain transaction structures, require that consideration must be paid within defined periods, generally not in excess of a year. The regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the initial consideration, contingent consideration, holdback provisions, indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts, nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies. In the future, we may grow our business in part by acquiring complementary businesses, although we do not have any plans to do so at this time. The M&A Rule also requires PRC Ministry of Commerce anti-trust review of any change-of-control transactions involving certain types of foreign acquirers. On February 3, 2011, the Circular on Establishing the Security Review System for Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors was promulgated by the General Office of the State Council, which went into effect on March 4, 2011. On August 25, 2011, the Ministry of Commerce issued the corresponding implementation rules. According to these rules, a foreign investor\u2019s acquisitions of Chinese companies in the fields of military, important agricultural products, energy and resources, infrastructure, transport service, key technology and major equipment manufacturing, and other restricted fields requires security review by a ministerial panel established and governed under the direction of the State Council and led by the National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Commerce. Complying with the requirements of the M&A Rule to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the PRC Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nInvestors may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in China based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws against us or our management.\nAll of our current operations are conducted in China. Moreover, most of our current directors and officers are nationals or residents of China. All or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States and in the PRC. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside China upon these persons. In addition, uncertainty exists as to whether the courts of China would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in China against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.\nOn March 16, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of China passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules, which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within China is considered a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a \u201cnon-domestically incorporated resident enterprise\u201d if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC shareholders. In addition, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues concerning the Determination of Resident Enterprises Based on the Standards of Actual Management Institutions in January 2014 to provide more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82. This bulletin further provides that, among other things, an entity that is classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d in accordance with the circular shall file the application for classifying its status of residential enterprise with the local tax authorities where its main domestic investors are registered. From the year in which the entity is determined to be a \u201cresident enterprise,\u201d any dividend, profit and other equity investment gains from other resident enterprises within China in previous years (on or after January 1, 2008) shall be taxed in accordance with the enterprise income tax law and its implementing rules.\nWe may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as \u201ctax-exempt income,\u201d we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new \u201cresident enterprise\u201d classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our shares. If we were treated as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d by the PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be used as a credit to reduce our U.S. tax.\nWe and our stockholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises or other assets attributed to a Chinese establishment of a non-Chinese company, or immovable properties located in China owned by non-Chinese companies.\nIn October 2017, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Bulletin on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-PRC Resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or Bulletin 37, which replaced the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises issued by the State Administration of Taxation on December 10, 2009, and partially replaced and supplemented rules under the Bulletin on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Bulletin 7, issued by the State Administration of Taxation on February 3, 2015. Pursuant to Bulletin 7, an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d of PRC assets, including a transfer of equity interests in an unlisted non-PRC holding company of a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of the underlying PRC assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. According to Bulletin 7, \u201cPRC taxable assets\u201d include assets attributed to an establishment in China, immoveable properties located in China, and equity investments in PRC resident enterprises and any gains from the transfer of such asset by a direct holder, who is a non-PRC resident enterprise, would be subject to PRC enterprise income taxes. When determining whether there is a \u201creasonable commercial purpose\u201d of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration include: whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consists of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income mainly derives from China; whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure; the duration of existence of the business model and organizational structure; the replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC taxable assets; and the tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. In the case of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the resulting gain is to be included with the enterprise income tax filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and may consequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer relates to immoveable properties located in China or to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax of 10% would apply, subject to available preferential tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements, and the party who is obligated to make the transfer payments has the withholding obligation. Pursuant to Bulletin 37, the withholding agent shall declare and pay the withheld tax to the competent tax authority in the place where such withholding agent is located within 7 days from the date of occurrence of the withholding obligation, while the transferor is required to declare and pay such tax to the competent tax authority within the statutory time limit according to Bulletin 7. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. Both Bulletin 37 and Bulletin 7 do not apply to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were acquired from a transaction through a public stock exchange.\nThere is uncertainty as to the application of Bulletin 37 or previous rules under Bulletin 7. We face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries or investments. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxes if our company is transferor in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions, under Bulletin 37 and Bulletin 7. For transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiary may be requested to assist in the filing under Bulletin 37 and Bulletin 7. As a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Bulletin 37 and Bulletin 7 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars, or to establish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, have agreements with third parties, and make most of our sales in China. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our subsidiaries, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our subsidiaries may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our subsidiaries liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nNumerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nThere are numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. These factors include:\n\u25cf our earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings, fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations of financial market analysts and investors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our shares;\n\u25cf speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;\n\u25cf significant developments relating to our relationships with our customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in our industries;\n\u25cf customer demand for our products;\n\u25cf investor perceptions of our industry in general and our company in particular;\n\u25cf the operating and stock performance of comparable companies;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and trends;\n\u25cf major catastrophic events;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new products, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or principles;\n\u25cf loss of external funding sources;\n\u25cf sales of our shares, including sales by our directors, officers or significant shareholders; and\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel.\nSecurities class action litigation is often instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their share price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources. Moreover, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to operating performance of particular companies. For example, from September 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market has ranged from a high of\u2009$11.30 to a low of\u2009$0.66. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our shares and other interests in our company at a time when you want to sell your interest in us.\nTechniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in China have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, a number of targets of such efforts are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\nWe have become the subject of certain unfavorable allegations. Although we believe such allegations are untrue, inaccurate or inflated, we have expended resources to investigate such allegations and defend ourselves and we may need to expend more resources in connection with these allegations in the future, which could be costly and time-consuming and could distract our management from growing our business. The allegations against us may severely impact our stock price and disrupt our business operations. Any investment in our common stock could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless due to such allegations.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us.\nOur common stock is traded and listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCBAT\u201d, which was changed from \u201cCBAK\u201d on November 30, 2018. The common stock may be delisted if we fail to maintain certain NASDAQ listing requirements.\nOn February 20, 2020, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share and as a result, the Company was no longer in compliance with the NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). We regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule on October 2, 2020.\nWe cannot assure you that the Company will continue to comply with the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market in the future. If our common stock loses its status on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our shares were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts\u2019 coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our common stock is delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, further limiting the liquidity of our common stock. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. Such delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions.\nYou may experience dilution to the extent that shares of our common stock are issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or other securities that we may issue in the future.\nYou may experience dilution to the extent that shares of our common stock are issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants of the Company, and if we issue additional equity securities, or there are any issuances and subsequent exercises of stock options issued in the future. On February 10, 2021, pursuant to a certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated February 8, 2021, we issued to certain investors (i) in a private placement, Series A-1 warrants to purchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 42 months from the date of issuance; (ii) in a registered direct offering, certain Series B warrants to purchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.83 and exercisable for 90 days from the date of issuance; and (iii) in the registered direct offering, certain Series A-2 warrants to purchase up to 2,234,992 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 45 months from the date of issuance. Prior to that, in December 2020, we issued to the same investors warrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,795,920 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.46 per share. These warrants are exercisable until 36 months after the date of issuance. The exercise prices of all of the above warrants are subject to full-ratchet anti-dilution adjustment in the case of future issuances or deemed issuances of shares of common stock below the warrants\u2019 exercise price then in effect, as well as customary adjustment in case of stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and similar recapitalization transactions. In addition, we issued to Mr. Jian Ke placement agent warrants to purchase up to 379,592 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.475 per share in December 2020 and the placement agent warrant to purchase up to 446,999 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $9.204 per share in February 2021. These warrants also bear customary anti-dilution protections in the event of stock dividends or splits, business combination, sale of assets, similar recapitalization transactions, or other similar transactions.\nOur directors and executive officers, collectively, own approximately 12.79% of our outstanding common stock and may possess significant influence in or control over our management and affairs.\nMr. Yunfei Li, our president and chief executive officer and chairman of our board, and our other executive officers and directors beneficially owns an aggregate of 12.79% of our outstanding common stock as of April 9, 2021. As a result, our directors and executive officers, acting together, may have significant influence in or control over our management and affairs, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidation, and sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, even if such a change of control would benefit our stockholders.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nIf we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner, and at favorable margins, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe battery industry has been notable for the pace of innovations in product life, product design and applied technology. We have made, and will continue to make, investments in research and development with the goal of further innovation. The successful development and introduction of new products and line extensions face the uncertainty of customer acceptance and reaction from competitors, as well as the possibility of cannibalization of sales of our existing products. In addition, our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can:\n\u25cf develop and fund research and technological innovations;\n\u25cf receive and maintain necessary intellectual property protections;\n\u25cf obtain governmental approvals and registrations;\n\u25cf comply with governmental regulations; and\n\u25cf anticipate customer needs and preferences successfully.\nThe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could also compromise our competitive position. If competitors introduce new or enhanced products that significantly outperform ours, or if they develop or apply manufacturing technology which permits them to manufacture at a significantly lower cost relative to ours, we may be unable to compete successfully in the market segments affected by these changes.\nA change in our product mix may cause our results of operations to differ substantially from the anticipated results in any particular period.\nOur overall profitability may not meet expectations if our products, customers or geographic mix are substantially different than anticipated. Our profit margins vary among products, customers and geographic markets. Consequently, if our mix of any of these is substantially different from what is anticipated in any particular period, our profitability could be lower than anticipated.\nManufacturing or use of our products may cause accidents, which could result in significant production interruption, delay or claims for substantial damages.\nDue to the high energy density inherent in lithium-based batteries, our batteries can pose certain safety risks, including the risk of fire. Although we incorporate safety procedures in the research, development, manufacture and transportation of batteries that are designed to minimize safety risks, the manufacture or use of our products may still cause accidents. Any accident, whether occurring at the manufacturing facilities or from the use of our products, may result in significant production interruption, delays or claims for substantial damages caused by personal injuries or property damages.\nWe may face impairment charges if economic environments in which our businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions substantially change.\nAssessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets is an integral part of our normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of long-lived assets is dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects our best estimates at a particular point in time, which may vary from testing date to testing date. The economic environments in which our businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected product selling prices and materials costs, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on both the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. Future changes in the economic environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in impairment charges. Any significant asset impairments would adversely impact our financial results.\nWe may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, which, if determined adversely to us, could cause our loss of significant rights and inability to continue providing our existing product offerings.\nOur success also depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. The validity and scope of claims relating to lithium-ion battery technology patents involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analysis and, therefore, may be highly expensive and time-consuming. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages to the party claiming infringement, develop non-infringing technologies or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business. Protracted litigation could result in our customers, or potential customers, deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation. Parties making the infringement claim may also obtain an injunction that can prevent us from selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing contents. Any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nCompliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and our failure to comply with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a manufacturer, we are subject to various PRC environmental laws and regulations on air emission, wastewater discharge, solid waste and noise. Although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and regulations, we may not be able to comply with these regulations at all times as the PRC environmental legal regime is evolving and becoming more stringent. Therefore, if the PRC government imposes more stringent regulations in the future, we will have to incur additional substantial costs and expenses in order to comply with new regulations, which may negatively affect our results of operations. If we fail to comply with any of the present or future environmental regulations in material aspects, we may suffer from negative publicity and may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend or even cease operations. Failure to comply with PRC environmental laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled employees and key personnel.\nBecause of the highly specialized, technical nature of our business, we must attract, train and retain a sizable workforce comprising highly skilled employees and other key personnel. Since our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we may have to pay higher salaries and wages and provide greater benefits in order to attract and retain highly skilled employees or other key personnel that we will need to achieve our strategic objectives. Our ability to train and integrate new employees into our operations may not meet the requirements of our growing business. Our failure to attract, train or retain highly skilled employees and other key personnel in numbers that are sufficient to satisfy our needs would materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf we become directly subject to the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nU.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies have also been subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions, and have been conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in China where substantially all of our operations and business are located have conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosures.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business take place in China, it may be more difficult for the Staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosures. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosures and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements has been reviewed or otherwise been scrutinized by any local regulator.", "PERMNO": 91269, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "CBAT"}
