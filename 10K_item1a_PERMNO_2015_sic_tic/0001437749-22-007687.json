RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nCompany, Industry and Economic Risk\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions may continue to adversely affect the company\u2019s business operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 has spread across the globe, has been declared a national emergency in the United States, Peru and Ecuador, and, during 2020, shut down many business operations around the globe. Many states and municipalities in the United States, Peru and Ecuador, have recommended or mandated aggressive and unprecedented actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing shelter-in-place\u201d orders, which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions). Across our operations, although most governmental restrictions on certain medical procedures have been lifted, the pandemic adversely impacted our business, as healthcare resources were being prioritized for the treatment and management of the outbreak in some cases. Consequently, there may continue to be delays in delivering certain Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments and significant volatility or reductions in demand for such treatments may continue. The COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that the Company or its employees, contractors, customers, government and third party payors and others may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that have been and may continue to be recommended or mandated by governmental authorities.\nA broad, sustained continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to negatively impact the Company for the following reasons:\n\u2022\noperations at certain medical facilities, including medical professionals and other medical facility employees, may be subject to prolonged closure or shut down and may impact our ability to market and deliver Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments;\n\u2022\nmedical facilities may defer certain Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments for non-urgent patient cases in order to allocate resources to the care of patients with COVID-19;\n\u2022\npatients may continue to defer certain Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments due to real or perceived concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19 in a medical facility setting;\n\u2022\ncertain deferred Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments may not be rescheduled for a later date;\n\u2022\nthere may be significant volatility or continued reductions in demand for Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments due to limitations on operations at medical facilities, including in geographies that continue to experience severe impacts of the pandemic;\n\u2022 there may be continued disruptions to the supply chain of the Company\u2019s suppliers, resulting in price increases for purchased services and capital acquisitions by the Company;\n\u2022\nthe pandemic may materially impact the Company\u2019s operations for a sustained period of time due to the current travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns;\n\u2022\nand/or members of the board, management or employee team, some of whom are particularly at risk for the severe symptoms of COVID-19, or of our small number of other employees, may become ill or have family members who are ill and are absent as a result, or they may elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or facilities.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions and healthcare activity, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown, including the impact on the global economy and the healthcare industry. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the Company\u2019s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and its variants, the effectiveness and implementation of vaccinations to counter the virus, actions to contain its impact, the efficacy of the current governmental orders in slowing down the pandemic, the governments\u2019 changing calculations on the economic impact and the health implications of maintaining these orders, the progress in the healthcare industry\u2019s ability to effectively combat the virus, and potential increase or decrease in healthcare demand, volatility and uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 responses, all of which are highly unpredictable. Likewise, the financial market as a whole has experienced extreme volatility as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted, and may continue to impact, the Company\u2019s stock price.\nWe refer you to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations\u201d for a more detailed discussions of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions, and the actual operational and financial impacts that we have experienced to date.\nIf the Company is not successful at diversifying its business model, its revenues and profitability may decline.\nThe Company has historically relied on Gamma Knife unit placement and a PBRT system to provide its revenues. Currently, there is a limited market for Gamma Knife equipment and there are few prospects for PBRT systems. As a result, we plan to adapt our business model to place other types of stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced radiation therapy equipment in addition to Gamma Knife units and PBRT systems. This will constitute an expanded product mix for the Company and there can be no assurance that we can successfully adapt our historical business model to these new product offerings. If we are not successful, our revenues and profitability could decline substantially as existing contracts expire and are not renewed.\nThe Federal reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatments may not provide the Company with an adequate return on its investment.\nCongress enacted legislation in 2013 that significantly reduced the Medicare reimbursement rate for outpatient Gamma Knife treatment by setting it at the same amount paid for linear accelerator-based radiosurgery treatment. Gamma Knife treatment has been relatively stable during the last five years. There can be no assurance that CMS reimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate return on its investment. Any future reductions in the reimbursement rate would adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and financial results.\nIntroduction of the RO APM reimbursement model could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results.\nOn September 18, 2020, CMS issued the final rule that would implement a new mandatory payment model for radiation oncology services: the RO APM. The RO APM is scheduled to commence January 1, 2023 and will be in effect for a five year period. The RO APM significantly alters CMS' payment methodology from a fee for service paradigm to a set reimbursement by cancer type methodology for radiation services provided within a 90 day episode of care. Under the RO APM, hospital based and free-standing radiation therapy providers are mandatorily required to participate in the model based on whether the radiation therapy provider is located within a randomly selected CBSA. CMS projects that providers treating approximately 30% of radiation oncology patients have been selected to participate in the RO APM. The remaining providers not included in the RO APM will continue to receive reimbursement based on a fee-for-service methodology. The RO APM includes but is not limited to PBRT and Gamma Knife services. Three of the Company\u2019s Gamma Knife centers are included in the RO APM. It is not anticipated that inclusion in the RO APM will have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s Gamma Knife domestic revenues. The Company\u2019s PBRT center was not initially selected for inclusion in the RO APM, but it could be included at a later date. If the Company\u2019s PBRT center is included at a later date, the episodic payment methodology is estimated to result in lower reimbursement than the current fee-per-service reimbursement.\nThe Company's retail revenue is subject to payor mix variability which could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s average reimbursement rate for its retail and international customers is dependent on the percentage mix of government associated payors and commercial managed care payors. Commercial and managed care payors tend to reimburse at a higher level than government payors. Therefore, a shift in payor mix to a higher level of government payors will reduce the Company\u2019s average reimbursement rate per treatment.\nThe Company\u2019s capital investment at each site is substantial and the Company may not be able to fully recover its costs or capital investment which could have a material negative impact on its revenues and financial results.\nEach Gamma Knife, PBRT or advanced LINEAR accelerator device requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment, which could have a material negative impact on our revenues and financial results. Additionally, the Company is obligated to remove the equipment at the end of the lease term. In the event the customer does not purchase the equipment from the Company or the Company is not able to trade in the equipment, the Company is required to remove the equipment and record an ARO.\nThe market for the Gamma Knife is limited and the Company may not be able to place additional Gamma Knife units which could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results.\nThere is a limited market for the Gamma Knife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun and continued operation at only seven new Gamma Knife sites in the United States since 2011. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 115 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which thirteen units were owned by the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at any sites in the future. In recognition of the Gamma Knife's limited growth opportunity, the Company has expanded its product mix to include LINACs, MRI LINACs, PET LINACs and is continuing to market PBRT units, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in placing these products with customers. The Company\u2019s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term.\nThe Company has a high level of debt and may incur additional debt to finance its operations and if the Company is unable to secure additional credit in the future its operations and profits will be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s business is capital intensive. On April 9, 2021, the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries entered into a five year $22,000,000 credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, N.A., which refinanced its existing domestic Gamma Knife portfolio. The lease financing previously obtained by Orlando was also refinanced as long-term debt by the Credit Agreement. In June 2020, the Company entered into the DFC Loan in connection with the acquisition of GKCE. The Company\u2019s combined long-term debt, net, totaled $15,404,000 as of December 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries and the DFC Loan is secured by a lien on GKCE\u2019s assets. The Credit Agreement includes a line of credit of $7,000,000 that it has not drawn on as of December 31, 2021. Depending on the Company\u2019s financing requirements and market conditions, the Company may seek to finance its operations by incurring additional long-term debt in the future. The Company\u2019s current level of debt may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If a default on debt occurs in the future, the Company\u2019s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Company\u2019s assets with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default.\nA small number of customers account for a major portion of our revenues and the loss of any one of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nA limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2021, three customers in total accounted for approximately 50% of the Company\u2019s revenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company\u2019s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe market for the company\u2019s services is competitive and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company estimates that there are two other companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. The Company\u2019s relationship with Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and in the past the Company has lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. The Company also has several competitors in the financing of proton therapy projects. The Company\u2019s business model differs from its competitors, but there can be no assurances that the Company will not lose placements to its competitors. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to customers purchasing equipment directly from manufacturers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete against others in placing future units and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThere are alternatives to the Gamma Knife and medical centers could choose to use other radiosurgery devices instead of the Gamma Knife.\nOther radiosurgery devices and conventional neurosurgery compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire another radiosurgery device instead of a Gamma Knife to perform cranial radiosurgery. In addition, neurosurgeons who are responsible for referring patients for Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. Because of these competing technologies, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth and accordingly there may be a material negative impact on the business and results of operations of the Company.\nInternational operations make the Company vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company installed a Gamma Knife unit in Lima, Peru in 2017 and acquired a Gamma Knife unit operation in Guayaquil, Ecuador in 2020. International operations can be subject to exchange rate volatility, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. In addition, international operations can be subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty and political and economic instability, which could result in problems asserting property or contractual rights, potential tariffs, increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, potential adverse tax consequences, the inability to repatriate funds to the United States, and the Company\u2019s inability to operate in those locations.\nNew technology and products could result in making the Company's equipment obsolete which could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations.\nThere is constant change and innovation in the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. In 2006 Elekta introduced a new model of the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which the Company has implemented at all of its domestic sites. The Perfexion can perform procedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it involves less health care personnel intervention. In 2015, Elekta introduced the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon \u2122. The Perfexion is upgradeable to the Icon platforms which has enhanced imaging capabilities allowing for treatment without a head frame and the treatment of larger tumors. Existing model 4(C)s of the Gamma Knife are not upgradeable to the Perfexion model. As of March 1, 2022, all the Company\u2019s Gamma Knife units in the United States are Perfexion models and two of these Perfexion units have the Icon upgrade. The Company's two South American sites utilize the Model 4(C). The failure to acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe Company has invested in a Proton Beam business and is obligated to fund two additional proton beams systems; there is no assurance that the Company will be able to fund these additional proton systems and if the Company is unable to do so the may be a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nWe have committed a substantial amount of our financial resources to next-generation proton beam technology. The first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in December 2013. The Company\u2019s first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in April 2016. The Company has committed to purchase two additional MEVION S250i systems and has already made deposits of $2,250,000 towards this commitment. As of December 31, 2020, the Company determined these deposits were impaired and wrote their value down to $0. See Note 3 - Property and Equipment to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional customers or be able to finance the two additional systems. If we are unable to obtain additional customers or are unable to finance the two additional systems, the Company will lose its deposits and there may be a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nStock Ownership Risk\nThe Trading Volume of Our Common Stock is Low\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, our common stock has historically experienced low trading volume. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 34,000 shares. There is no reason to think that a further increase in an active trading market in our common stock will develop in the future. Limited trading volume subjects our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares in a quantity or at a price that is attractive to you.", "PERMNO": 13769, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "AMS"}
