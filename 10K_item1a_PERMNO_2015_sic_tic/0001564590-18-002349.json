RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition to the risk factors discussed below, investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties presented in Part 1 - Item 1. Business.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nOur cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nUnder the REIT rules, to remain qualified as a REIT, a REIT must distribute, within a certain period after the end of each year, 90% of its ordinary taxable income for such year. Our REIT income, however, consists primarily of net capital gains resulting from payments received under timber cutting contracts with Potlatch TRS and third parties, rather than ordinary taxable income. Therefore, unlike most REITs, we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash to remain qualified as a REIT. If, after giving effect to our dividends, we have not distributed an amount equal to 100% of our REIT taxable income, then we would be required to pay tax on the undistributed portion of such taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and our stockholders would be required to include their proportionate share of any undistributed capital gain in income and would receive a credit or refund for their share of the tax paid by us.\nOur board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the actual amount of dividends to be made to stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions in our industry and in the markets for our products, tax considerations, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions, timber prices, harvest levels on our timberlands, market demand for timberlands, including timberland properties we have identified as potentially having a higher and better use and future acquisitions and dispositions. For a description of debt covenants that could limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders in the future, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Consequently, the level of future dividends to our stockholders may fluctuate and any reduction in the dividend rate may adversely affect our stock price.\nThe cyclical nature of our business could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe financial performance of our operations is affected by the cyclical nature of our business. The markets for timber, manufactured wood products and real estate are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. The demand for our timber and manufactured wood products is affected by the level of new residential construction, home repair and remodeling and commercial and industrial building activity, which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and other factors. The demand for logs is also affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices. Historical prices for our manufactured wood products have been volatile and we have limited direct influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our manufactured wood products. The demand for real estate can be affected by changes in factors such as interest rates, credit availability and economic conditions, as well as by the impact of federal, state and local land use and environmental protection laws.\nAll of our timberlands are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Minnesota and Mississippi. As a result, we may be susceptible to adverse economic and other developments in these regions, including industry slowdowns,\nbusiness layoffs or downsizing, relocations of businesses, changes in demographics, increases in real estate and other taxes and increased regulation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber.\nA variety of factors affect prices for timber, including factors affecting demand, such as changes in economic conditions, the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity, foreign demand, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and pest infestation, as well as changes in timber supply and other factors. All of these factors can vary by region, timber type (sawlogs or pulpwood logs) and species.\nTimber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local, national or international level. The closure of a mill in the regions where we own timber can have a material adverse effect on demand and therefore pricing. As the demand for paper nationwide continues to decline, closures of pulp mills have adversely affected the demand for pulpwood and wood chips in certain of the regions in which we operate. Also, demand in other parts of the world may affect timber prices in the markets in which we compete. For example, although we do not sell into the Asian markets, Asian demand has affected supply in North American markets. A recent decrease in Asian demand has had a negative impact on lumber and timber prices in the North American markets.\nTimber prices are also affected by changes in timber availability at the local, national and international level. Our timberland ownership is currently concentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Minnesota and Mississippi. In Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota and Mississippi, most timberlands are privately owned. Historically, increases in timber prices have often resulted in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands, including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations, causing a short-term increase in supply that has tended to moderate price increases. Decreases in timber prices have often resulted in lower harvest levels, causing short-term decreases in supply that have tended to moderate price decreases. In the South, timber growth rates have exceeded harvests during the past decade, which have led to an oversupply of timber in the region, which in turn has reduced prices. In Idaho, where a greater proportion of timberland is government-owned, any substantial increase in timber harvesting from government-owned land could significantly reduce timber prices, which would harm our results of operations. For more than 20 years, environmental concerns and other factors have limited timber sales by federal agencies, which historically had been major suppliers of timber to the U.S. forest products industry, particularly in the West. Any reversal of policy that substantially increases timber sales from government-owned land could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOn a local level, timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as unusual pest infestations or fires.\nOur wood products are commodities that are widely available from other producers.\nBecause commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. Prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile. Our profitability with respect to these products depends, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material and energy costs, which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control.\nThe wood products industry is highly competitive.\nThe markets for our wood products are highly competitive and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our lines of business. Our wood products are subject to competition from wood products manufacturers in the United States and Canada. After years of trade disputes over Canadian softwood lumber imports, the United States and Canada signed a Softwood Lumber Agreement in 2006, which expired in October 2015. The agreement established a system of tiered taxes and volume restrictions relating to Canadian lumber imports to the United States. Following expiration of the softwood lumber agreement, imports of Canadian lumber to the United States at lower prices increased, depressing U.S. lumber prices. On November 25, 2016, the U.S. lumber industry filed a petition seeking countervailing (CVD) and anti-dumping (AD) duties on Canadian lumber imports with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Final rulings on injury and CVD and\nAD duties went into effect on December 28, 2017. The combined CVD and AD duty to be paid by most Canadian exporters was established at 20.23%. The Canadians have commenced proceedings with the NAFTA appeals panel and the World Trade Organization appealing the imposition of the duties. In addition, the governments of the United States and Canada continue to state publicly their intention to reach a negotiated settlement of these trade cases. Even if an agreement is successfully negotiated, there can be no assurance that it will at all times, or at any time, effectively create a fair trade environment. Additional information regarding the expiration of the Softwood Lumber Agreement is included in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition, our wood products manufacturing facilities are relatively capital intensive, which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs. These conditions have contributed to substantial price competition, particularly during periods of reduced demand. Some of our wood products competitors may currently be lower-cost producers than we are, or may benefit from weak currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and accordingly these competitors may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases. Wood products also are subject to significant competition from a variety of substitute products, including non-wood and engineered wood products. To the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressure from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be adversely affected.\nChanges in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.\nA number of factors, including availability of credit, a slowing of residential real estate development, population shifts and changes in demographics could reduce the demand for our real estate and negatively affect our results of operations. Changes in investor interest in purchasing timberlands could reduce our ability to execute sales of non-core timberlands and could also negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of current laws, or the enactment of new laws, regarding the use and development of real estate, or changes in the political composition of federal, state and local governmental bodies could lead to new or greater costs, delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our real estate business, profitability or financial condition.\nThere are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results in any particular quarter. The timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including the general state of the economy, demand in local real estate markets, the number of properties listed for sale, the seasonal nature of sales, the plans of adjacent landowners and our expectations of future price appreciation. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions may be beyond our control. These events could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may be unable to harvest timber or we may elect to reduce harvest levels due to market, weather and regulatory conditions, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur timber harvest levels and sales may be limited due to weather conditions, timber growth cycles, restrictions on access, availability of contract loggers and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources, as well as by other factors, including damage by fire, pest infestation, disease and natural disasters such as ice storms, wind storms, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. Changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors. Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized, affecting only a limited percentage of our timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will be limited. We typically experience seasonally lower harvest activity during the winter and early spring due to weather conditions. Severe weather conditions and other natural disasters can also reduce the productivity of timberlands and disrupt the harvesting and delivery of logs. Our financial results and cash flows are dependent to a significant extent on our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels.\nOn a short-term basis, we may adjust our timber harvest levels in response to market conditions. Longer term, our timber harvest levels will be affected by acquisitions of additional timberlands, sales of existing timberlands and shifts in harvest from one region to another. In addition to timberland acquisitions and sales, future timber harvest levels may be affected by changes in estimates of long-term sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances, natural disasters, fires, pests, insects and other hazards, regulatory constraints and other factors beyond our control.\nWe do not insure against losses of standing timber from fire or any other causes.\nThe volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be affected by natural disasters such as fire, pest infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and other weather conditions and causes beyond our control. As is typical in the forest industry, we assume substantially all risk of loss to the standing timber we own from fire and other hazards because insuring for such losses is not practicable. Consequently, a reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nIn addition, the geographic concentration of our property makes us more susceptible to adverse impacts from a single natural disaster such as fire, hurricane, earthquake, insect infestation, drought, disease, ice storms, windstorms, tornadoes, flooding and other factors that could negatively impact our timber production.\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including unscheduled maintenance outages, prolonged power failures, equipment failures, raw material shortages, cyber-attacks, labor difficulties, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels, fire, ice storms, floods, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes or other catastrophes, terrorism or threats of terrorism, governmental regulations and other operational problems.\nAny such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income.\nOur businesses are affected by logger and transportation availability and costs.\nOur business depends on the availability of logging contractors and providers of transportation of wood products and is materially affected by the cost and availability of these service providers. Therefore, increases in the cost of fuel could negatively impact our financial results by increasing the cost associated with logging activities and transportation services and could also result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services. Truck driver shortages could negatively impact our financial results by reducing the volume of delivered wood products.\nWe may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy.\nWe have pursued, and may continue to pursue, acquisitions of strategic timberland properties and other forest products assets. We compete with buyers that have substantially greater financial resources than we have for acquisition opportunities. We intend to finance acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings, proceeds from asset dispositions or any combination thereof. In addition, it is uncertain whether any acquisitions we make will perform in accordance with our expectations. The failure to identify and complete acquisitions of suitable properties could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding protection of the environment, including those relating to the protection of timberlands, endangered species, timber harvesting practices, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality and remedial standards for contaminated soil, sediments and groundwater. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in significant fines or penalties, as well as liabilities for remediation of contaminated sites, natural resource damages or alleged personal injury or property damage claims.\nLaws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber and operate our manufacturing facilities and may adversely affect the ability of others to develop property we intend to sell for higher and better use purposes. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the\nenforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. We believe that these laws and regulations will continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results. Regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. For example, the Clean Water Act and comparable state laws, regulations and best management practices programs protect water quality. As a result, our resource management activities adjacent to rivers and streams, as well as the point source discharges from our manufacturing facilities, are subject to strict regulation and there can be no assurance that our forest management and manufacturing activities will not be subject to increased regulation under the Clean Water Act in the future.\nSimilarly, the threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. A number of species on our timberlands have been, and in the future may be, protected under these laws. If current or future regulations or their enforcement become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.\nWe anticipate that increasingly strict laws and regulations relating to the environment, natural resources and forestry operations, as well as increased social concern over environmental issues, may result in additional restrictions on us, leading to increased costs, additional capital expenditures and reduced operating flexibility.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits covering air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal that govern how we operate our facilities. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. Overall, it is expected that environmental compliance costs will likely increase over time as environmental requirements become more stringent and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.\nCertain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on responsible parties, including current and former owners and operators of contaminated sites, for costs of investigation and remediation of contamination. They also impose liability for related damages to natural resources. We have in the past been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA at various locations and we are currently identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with one of our properties. Additional information regarding this matter is included in Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report and that information is incorporated herein by reference. It is possible that other facilities we own or operate, or formerly owned or operated, or timberlands we now own or acquire, could also become subject to liabilities under these laws. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect our financial results. Although we believe we have appropriate amounts accrued for the investigation and remediation of known matters, there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations and that amounts accrued will not be increased or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future.\nEnvironmental groups and interested individuals may intervene in the regulatory processes in the locations where we own timberlands and operate our wood products mills. Delays or restrictions on our operations due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested parties may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, harvesting timber under contract with federal or state agencies, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans or require us to obtain permits before pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit, or even a threatened lawsuit, could delay harvesting on our timberlands or impact our ability to operate or invest in our wood products mills.\nOur defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded.\nWe have qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees. The determination of pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Pension plan assets primarily consist of equity and fixed income investments; therefore, fluctuations in actual equity market returns and changes in long-term interest rates may result in\nincreased pension costs in future periods. Changes in assumptions regarding discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase future pension costs. Changes in any of these factors may significantly impact future contribution requirements. For additional information regarding this matter see Note 12: Savings Plans, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe depend on external sources of capital for future growth.\nOur ability to finance growth is dependent to a significant degree on external sources of capital. Our ability to access such capital on favorable terms could be hampered by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including a decline in general market conditions, decreased market liquidity, a downgrade to our public debt rating, increases in interest rates, an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. In addition, our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, among other things, restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends. For additional details, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any of these factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us and the failure to obtain necessary capital could materially adversely affect our future growth.\nA strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately 18% of our workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which expires in 2020. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other non-unionized operations were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs. A strike or other work stoppage in the facilities of any of our major customers or suppliers could also have similar effects on us.\nA security failure of our information technology infrastructure could impact our ability to operate our businesses effectively, adversely affect our reported financial results, impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability or litigation.\nWe use information systems to carry out our operational activities and maintain our business records. Some systems are internally managed, and some are maintained by third-party service providers. We and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security measures. Our ability to conduct business could be materially and adversely affected if these systems or resources are compromised, damaged or fail. This could be a result of a cyber incident, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption, failure or error, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions or other disruption.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store small amounts of sensitive data, including personally identifiable information. If this data is compromised, destroyed or inappropriately disclosed, it could have a material adverse effect, including damage to our reputation, loss of customers, significant expenses to address and resolve the issues, or litigation or other proceedings by affected individuals, business partners and/or regulators.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends to stockholders and fulfill our debt obligations, our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund future needs.\nOur debt requires interest and principal payments. As of December 31, 2017, we had long-term debt of $576.5 million, including $14.3 million due in the first quarter of 2018. Subject to the limits contained in our debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our indebtedness could intensify.\nOur indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness or to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences for stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for dividends to stockholders, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have relatively less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, if needed, for dividends to stockholders, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets, increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. For additional detail on our credit ratings see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nREIT and Tax-Related Risks\nIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, income from our timberlands will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates and we will have reduced cash available for dividends to our stockholders.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations, including satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, dividend, stockholder ownership and other requirements, on an ongoing basis. Given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a REIT.\nIn addition, the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury). Changes to the tax laws affecting REITs or taxable REIT subsidiaries, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect our stockholders or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our stockholders or us. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that new legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, the determination of the amount of REIT taxable income or the amount of tax paid by the TRS.\nIf in any taxable year we fail to remain qualified as a REIT:\n\u2022\nwe would not be allowed a deduction for dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and\n\u2022\nwe would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax.\nAny such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for dividends to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock. In addition, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions. As a result, net income and the cash available for dividends to our stockholders could be reduced for at least five years, which would have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock.\nCertain of our business activities are potentially subject to a prohibited transactions tax on 100% of our net income derived from such activities, which would reduce our cash flow and impair our ability to pay dividends.\nREITs are generally intended to be passive entities and can thus only engage in those activities permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, which for us generally include owning and managing a timberland portfolio, growing timber and selling standing timber.\nAccordingly, the manufacture and sale of wood products, certain types of timberland sales and the harvest and sale of logs are conducted through Potlatch TRS because such activities generate non-qualifying REIT income and could constitute \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d if such activities were engaged in directly by the REIT. In general, prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code to be sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.\nBy conducting our business in this manner, we believe we will satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and thus avoid the 100% tax that could be imposed if a REIT were to conduct a prohibited transaction. We may not always be successful, however, in limiting such activities to Potlatch TRS. Therefore, we could be subject to the 100% prohibited transactions tax if such instances were to occur, which would adversely affect our cash flow and impair our ability to pay quarterly dividends.\nOur REIT structure may limit our ability to invest in our non-REIT qualifying operations.\nOur use of Potlatch TRS enables us to continue to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities consisting primarily of our manufacturing facilities, assets used for the harvesting of timber and the sale of logs and selected land parcels that we expect to be sold or developed for higher and better use purposes. However, under the Internal Revenue Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. This may limit our ability to make investments in our wood products manufacturing operations or in other non-REIT qualifying operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends and service our indebtedness using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiary may be limited.\nThe rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT limit our ability to use dividends from Potlatch TRS for the payment of stockholder dividends and to service our indebtedness. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of real estate income. No more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividends from Potlatch TRS and other non-qualifying types of income. This requirement may limit our ability to receive dividends from Potlatch TRS and may impact our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and service the REIT's indebtedness using cash from Potlatch TRS.\nWe may not be able to realize our deferred tax assets.\nWe may not have sufficient future taxable income to realize all our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences are deductible as governed by the Internal Revenue Code. On December 22, 2017, the H.R. 1, Tax Cut and Jobs Act was enacted that decreased the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, the value of our deferred tax assets was reduced by $10.7 million. The amount of our deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if future taxable income does not materialize or management is unable to implement one or more strategies that it has identified to generate taxable income. See Note 15: Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for additional information about our deferred tax assets.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above under Business and Operating Risks and the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors\u2019 operating results, announcements by us or our competitors of capacity changes, acquisitions or strategic investments, our growth rate and our competitors\u2019 growth rates, the financial markets, interest rates and general economic conditions, changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock, failure to pay cash dividends or the amount of cash dividends paid, sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock, changes in accounting principles and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interest of us and our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent and stockholders cannot call a special meeting except upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nallowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nin order to facilitate the preservation of our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, a prohibition on any single stockholder, or any group of affiliated stockholders, from beneficially owning more than 9.8% of our outstanding common or preferred stock, unless our board waives or modifies this ownership limitation;\n\u2022\nunless approved by the vote of at least 80% of our outstanding shares, we may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock; and\n\u2022\nsupermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could have similar effects. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.\nRisks Related to Our Merger with Deltic\nOur merger with Deltic may not be completed on the terms currently contemplated, or at all.\nThe Company, Merger Sub and Deltic entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Deltic will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation. If the merger is not completed, our businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to various risks without realizing any of the benefits of having the merger completed, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of $66 million;\n\u2022\nWe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers or employees; and\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nAny delay in completing the merger, which is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are outside of our control, may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from the transaction.\nThe merger is subject to required stockholder approvals, which may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. The requirements for obtaining the required stockholder approvals could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. In addition, several putative class action lawsuits relating to the merger have been filed and additional lawsuits may be filed, which could delay completion of the merger. We intend to vigorously defend the litigation but we cannot predict the outcome. Any delay in completing the merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the synergies and other benefits that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame. The Merger Agreement contains certain restrictions on the conduct of our business. If the merger is delayed, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to execute business strategies or pursue attractive business opportunities. In addition, a delay could cause our management to focus on completion of the merger instead of on other opportunities that could be beneficial to the company.\nThe merger will involve substantial costs.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and expenses relating directly to the merger including fees and expenses payable to financial advisors, other professional fees and expenses, insurance premium costs, HSR filing fees, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing costs and other transaction-related costs, fees and expenses. We also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs, employment-related costs and costs related to the special distribution. There are a large number of systems that must be integrated, including management\ninformation, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits, fixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance. Expenses related to this integration are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the realization of economies of scale and cost savings and synergies related to the integration of the businesses. These integration expenses likely will result in significant charges against earnings following the completion of the merger, but the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain.\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully the businesses of Potlatch and Deltic and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe merger involves the combination of two independently operated public companies. The merger will require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating business practices and operations. The combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully combine the businesses of Potlatch and Deltic in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and synergies anticipated to result from the merger, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the merger not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nlost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel from the two companies;\n\u2022\ncreation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nUncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees of Potlatch or Deltic which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company following the merger.\nPotlatch and Deltic are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans and conduct operations. The combined company\u2019s success after the merger will depend in part upon its ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of Potlatch and Deltic. Current and prospective employees of Potlatch and Deltic may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of each of Potlatch and Deltic to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to retain key management personnel and other key employees of Potlatch and Deltic.\nUncertainty due to the pendency of the merger could adversely affect the business and operations of Potlatch or Deltic.\nIn connection with the pendency of the merger, some customers, suppliers or other entities with whom Potlatch or Deltic have a business relationship may delay or defer decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings and cash flows of Potlatch or Deltic, as well as the market price of shares of Potlatch common stock regardless of whether the merger is completed. In addition, customers or suppliers may cease doing business with Potlatch, Deltic or the combined company in anticipation of or following the merger or may change the terms and conditions upon which they are willing to continue to do business. In addition, current or prospective competitors of Potlatch, Deltic or the combined company may seek to take advantage of potential uncertainty or disruption resulting from the merger to interfere with relationships with customers, suppliers or employees.\nPotlatch\u2019s future results will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the merger.\nFollowing the merger, the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either Potlatch\u2019s or Deltic\u2019s current businesses. In addition, the combined company may continue to expand its operations through additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Potlatch\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage its expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected economies of scale, synergies and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger or anticipated from any additional acquisitions or strategic transactions.\nThe market price of shares of Potlatch common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger.\nThe market price of shares of Potlatch common stock may decline in the future as a result of the merger for a number of reasons, including the unsuccessful integration of Potlatch and Deltic or the failure of Potlatch to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nThe merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to Potlatch\u2019s cash available for distribution per share, which may negatively affect the market price of shares of Potlatch common stock.\nThe merger is expected to deliver accretion to Potlatch\u2019s cash available for distribution per share in the first full year after the merger, including cost synergies and excluding integration and restructuring activities. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change, including the currently expected timing of the merger. Potlatch could also encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors such as a delay in the closing of the merger or the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger. Any of these factors could cause dilution to Potlatch\u2019s cash available for distribution per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the market price of shares of Potlatch common stock.\nThe combined company may incur adverse tax consequences as a result of Deltic\u2019s status as a non-REIT \u201cC corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nBecause Deltic is not a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Potlatch and its stockholders will face the following adverse tax consequences as a result of the merger:\n\u2022\nPotlatch will generally inherit any corporate income tax liabilities of Deltic, including penalties and interest;\n\u2022\nPotlatch will be subject to regular corporate-level tax on the built-in gain in each asset of Deltic existing at the time of the merger if Potlatch were to dispose of a Deltic asset during the five-year period following the merger; and\n\u2022\nPotlatch will be required to pay one or more special distributions to eliminate any earnings and profits accumulated by Deltic, which distributions will be taxable and are expected in substantial part to be paid in Potlatch stock and thus may cause a stockholder receiving such distributions to incur a tax liability that exceeds the cash received by such stockholder.\nAs a result of these factors, Deltic\u2019s status as a non-REIT \u201cC corporation\u201d could reduce Potlatch\u2019s cash available for distribution to stockholders or impair its ability after the merger to expand its business and raise capital, could materially adversely affect the value of shares of Potlatch\u2019s common stock, and could have other adverse effects for Potlatch and its stockholders.", "PERMNO": 49744, "SIC": 2421, "TIC": "PCH"}
