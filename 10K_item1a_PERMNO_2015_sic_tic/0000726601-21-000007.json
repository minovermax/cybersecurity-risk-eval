You\nshould consider carefully the following\nrisk factors before\ndeciding whether to invest in our common stock.\nOur business, including our operating results and\nfinancial condition, could be\nharmed by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to us or that we currently\ndeem to be\nimmaterial also may materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness. The trading price of our common stock could decline\ndue to\nany of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nIn assessing these risks, you should also refer\nto the other\ninformation contained in our filings with the SEC, including\nour financial statements and related\nnotes.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, associates\nand business operations has had, and will likely\ncontinue to have, a significant adverse effect\non our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a global public\n-health crisis that resulted in challenging economic conditions for\nhouseholds\nand businesses.\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted\na broad range of industries.\nThere is increasing\nconcern about the longer lasting impact on local business resulting\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Federal Reserve returned to a zero-interest rate policy\nin March 2020 and the U.S. government enacted several fiscal stimulus\nmeasures to counteract the economic disruption caused\nby the COVID-19 pandemic and provide economic\nassistance to\nbusinesses and households. The dramatic lowering of\nmarket interest rates in a short period of time had an adverse\neffect on the\nCompany's asset yields.\nThe majority of the fiscal assistance provided\nby the federal government to businesses and households\ntapered off by December 31, 2020, which could\nadversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. The\nCompany's\nfinancial performance is dependent upon the ability of\nborrowers to repay their loans.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes to our business operations\nduring the current year and could continue to result in\nchanges to operations in future periods.\nDepending on the severity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic, which\nis impossible to\npredict, we could experience significant disruptions in our\nbusiness operations if key personnel or a significant number of\nemployees were to become unavailable due to the effects\nof, and restrictions resulting from, the COVID-19 pandemic,\nas well as\ndecreased demand for our products and services.\nThere is pervasive uncertainty surrounding the future\neconomic conditions that will emerge in the months and\nyears following the\nstart of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result, management is confronted with a significant degree\nof uncertainty in estimating the\nimpact of the pandemic on credit quality,\nrevenues and asset values.\nAsset quality may deteriorate and the amount of our\nallowance for loan losses may not be sufficient\nfor future loan losses we may experience.\nThis could require us to increase our\nreserves and recognize more expense in future periods.\nThe changes in market rates of interest and the impact\nthat has on our\nability to price our products may reduce our net interest income\nin the future or negatively impact the demand for our products.\nThere is some risk that operational costs could further increase as we\nmaintain existing facilities in accordance with health\nguidelines as well as have associates continue to work\nremotely.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition, as well as\nour\nregulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments,\nwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,\nincluding the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand actions taken by governmental authorities and other\nthird\nparties in response to the pandemic.\nWe may incur losses if we are\nunable to successfully manage interest rate\nrisk.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent\non Capital City Bank\u2019s net\ninterest income, which is the difference between\nincome on\ninterest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities,\nand expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and\nborrowings. We\nare unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are\naffected by many factors beyond our control,\nincluding inflation, recession, unemployment, federal funds\ntarget rate, money supply,\ndomestic and international events and\nchanges in the United States and other financial markets.\nOur net interest income may be reduced if: (i) more interest-earning\nassets than interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature\nduring a time when interest rates are declining or (ii) more\ninterest-bearing\nliabilities than interest-earning assets reprice or mature\nduring a time when interest rates are rising.\nChanges in the difference between short\n-term and long-term interest rates may also harm our\nbusiness. We generally\nuse short-\nterm deposits to fund longer-term assets. When\ninterest rates change, assets and liabilities with shorter terms\nreprice more quickly\nthan those with longer terms, which could have\na material adverse effect on our net interest margin.\nIf market interest rates rise\nrapidly, interest rate\nadjustment caps may also limit increases in the interest rates on\nadjustable rate loans, which could further\nreduce our net interest income. Additionally,\nwe believe that due to the recent historical low interest rate environment,\nthe effects\nof the repeal of Regulation Q, which previously had prohibited\nthe payment of interest on demand deposits by member\nbanks of\nthe Federal Reserve System, have not been realized. The\nincreased price competition for deposits that may result upon\nthe return\nto a historically normal interest rate environment could\nadversely affect net interest margins of community\nbanks.\nAlthough we continuously monitor interest rates and\nhave a number of tools to manage our interest rate risk\nexposure, changes in\nmarket assumptions regarding future interest rates could\nsignificantly impact our interest rate risk strategy,\nour financial position\nand results of operations. If we do not properly monitor\nour interest rate risk management strategies, these activities may not\neffectively mitigate our interest rate sensitivity or\nhave the desired impact on our results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nInterest rates and economic conditions affect\nconsumer demand for housing and can create volatility in the mortgage\nindustry.\nThese risk can have a material impact on the volume of mortgage\noriginations and refinancings, adversely affecting\nour mortgage\nbanking revenues and the profitability of our mortgage\nbanking business.\nWe may be adversely\naffected by changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or\nthe replacement of LIBOR with an\nalternative reference rate.\nOur business relies upon loans and other financial instruments that\nare directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish\ntheir interest rate and/or value. The administrator of LIBOR has\nproposed to extend publication of the most commonly\nused U.S.\nDollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and to cease\npublishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021.\nThe U.S. federal\nbanking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging\nbanking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar\nLIBOR as a\nreference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable\nand in any event by December 31, 2021. We\ndo not know whether LIBOR\nwill continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark,\nwhat rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or\nwhat the effect of any such changes in views\nor alternatives may have on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked\nfinancial\ninstruments. The transition from LIBOR may cause us to\nincur increased costs and face additional risks. Uncertainty\nas to the\nnature of alternative reference rates and as to potential\nchanges in or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect\nLIBOR rates\nand the value of LIBOR-based loans originated prior\nto 2021. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, any successor or\nreplacement interest rates may perform differently,\nwhich may affect our net interest income, change\nour market risk profile and\nrequire changes to our strategies. Any failure to adequately\nmanage this transition could adversely impact our\nreputation.\nRisks Related to Lending Activities\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of\nloss which could lead to higher loan losses and nonperforming\nassets.\nWe originate\ncommercial real estate loans, commercial loans, construction loans,\nvacant land loans, consumer loans, and\nresidential mortgage loans primarily within our market\narea. Commercial real estate, commercial, construction, vacant\nland, and\nconsumer loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk\nthan traditional fixed-rate fully amortizing loans secured\nby single-\nfamily residential real estate because the collateral securin\ng\nthese loans may not be sold as easily as single-family residential real\nestate. In addition, these loan types tend to involve larger\nloan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers and\nare more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn\nin the business cycle. These loans also have historically had\ngreater credit\nrisk than other loans for the following reasons:\n\u25cf\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\n. Repayment is dependent on income being generated\nin amounts sufficient to cover\noperating expenses and debt service. These loans also involve\ngreater risk because they are generally not fully amortizing\nover the loan period, but rather have a balloon payment due\nat maturity. A borrower\u2019s\nability to make a balloon payment\ntypically will depend on the borrower\u2019s ability\nto either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2020,\ncommercial mortgage loans comprised approximately 32.3% of\nour total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nCommercial Loans\n. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful\noperation of the borrower\u2019s business. In\naddition, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate\nover time, be difficult to appraise, be illiquid,\nor fluctuate in\nvalue based on the success of the business. At December\n31, 2020, commercial loans comprised approximately 19.6% of\nour total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nConstruction Loans\n. The risk of loss is largely dependent\non our initial estimate of whether the property\u2019s\nvalue at\ncompletion equals or exceeds the cost of property construction\nand the availability of take-out financing. During the\nconstruction phase, a number of factors can result in delays or\ncost overruns. If our estimate is inaccurate or if actual\nconstruction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property\nsecuring our loan may be insufficient to ensure\nfull\nrepayment when completed through a permanent\nloan, sale of the property,\nor by seizure of collateral.\nAt December 31,\n2020 construction loans comprised approximately 6.8% of\nour total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nVacant\nLand Loans\n. Because vacant or unimproved land is generally\nheld by the borrower for investment purposes or\nfuture use, payments on loans secured by vacant or unimproved\nland will typically rank lower in priority to the borrower\nthan a loan the borrower may have on their primary\nresidence or business. These loans are susceptible to adverse\nconditions in the real estate market and local economy.\nAt December 31, 2020,\nvacant land loans comprised\napproximately 2.7% of our total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nHELOCs\n. Our open-ended home equity loans have an interest-only\ndraw period followed by a five-year repayment\nperiod of 0.75% of the principal balance monthly and a\nballoon payment at maturity.\nUpon the commencement of the\nrepayment period, the monthly payment can increase significantly,\nthus, there is a heightened risk that the borrower will\nbe unable to pay the increased payment. Further,\nthese loans also involve greater risk because they are generally\nnot fully\namortizing over the loan period, but rather have a balloon\npayment due at maturity.\nA borrower\u2019s ability to make a\nballoon payment may depend on the borrower\u2019s\nability to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying\nproperty.\nAt December 31, 2020 HELOCs comprised approximately\n10.2%\nof our total loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nConsumer Loans\n. Consumer loans (such as automobile loans and\npersonal lines of credit) are collateralized, if at all,\nwith assets that may not provide an adequate source of\npayment of the loan due to depreciation, damage, or\nloss. At\nDecember 31, 2020,\nconsumer loans comprised approximately 13.5%\nof our total loan portfolio, with indirect auto loans\nmaking up a majority of this portfolio at approximately\n90.4% of the total balance.\nThe increased risks associated with these types of\nloans result in a correspondingly higher probability of\ndefault on such loans (as\ncompared to fixed-rate fully amortizing single-family\nreal estate loans). Loan defaults would likely increase our loan\nlosses and\nnonperforming assets and could adversely affect\nour allowance for loan losses and our results of operations\n.\nOur loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in mortgage\nloans secured by properties in Florida and Georgia\nwhich causes\nour risk of loss to be higher than if we had a more\ngeographically diversified portfolio.\nOur interest-earning assets are heavily concentrated in mortgage\nloans secured by real estate, particularly real estate located in\nFlorida and Georgia.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 67%\nof our loans included real estate as a primary,\nsecondary, or\ntertiary component of collateral. The real estate collateral\nin each case provides an alternate source of repayment in\nthe event of\ndefault by the borrower; however,\nthe value of the collateral may decline during the time the credit\nis extended. If we are required\nto liquidate the collateral securing a loan during\na period of reduced real estate values to satisfy the debt, our earnings\nand capital\ncould be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, at\nDecember 31, 2020, substantially all of our loans secured by real\nestate are secured by commercial and residential\nproperties located in Northern Florida and Middle Georgia.\nThe concentration of our loans in these areas subjects us to\nrisk that a\ndownturn in the economy or recession in these areas could\nresult in a decrease in loan originations and increases in delinquencies\nand foreclosures, which would more greatly affect\nus than if our lending were more geographically diversified.\nIn addition, since\na large portion of our portfolio is secured by\nproperties located in Florida and Georgia, the\noccurrence of a natural disaster, such\nas a hurricane, or a man-made disaster could result in\na decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction\nof\nmortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies,\nforeclosures or loss on loans originated by us. We\nmay suffer\nfurther losses due to the decline in the value of the properties\nunderlying our mortgage loans, which would have an adverse\nimpact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real\nestate may increase our credit losses, which\nwould negatively affect our\nfinancial results.\nDue to the lack of diversified industry within the markets\nserved by CCB and the relatively close proximity of our geographic\nmarkets, we have both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations\nin the types of loans funded. Specifically,\ndue to the\nnature of our markets, a significant portion of the portfolio\nhas historically been secured with real estate. At December\n31, 2020,\napproximately 32%\nand 28% of our $2.006 billion loan portfolio was secured by commercial\nreal estate and residential real estate,\nrespectively. As of\nthis same date, approximately 7% was secured by property under\nconstruction.\nIn the event we are required to foreclose on a property securing\none of our mortgage loans or otherwise pursue our remedies in\norder to protect our investment, we may be unable\nto recover funds in an amount equal to our projected return\non our investment\nor in an amount sufficient to prevent a loss to\nus due to prevailing economic conditions, real estate values and\nother factors\nassociated with the ownership of real property.\nAs a result, the market value of the real estate or other collateral\nunderlying our\nloans may not, at any given time, be sufficient\nto satisfy the outstanding principal amount of the loans, and consequently,\nwe\nwould sustain loan losses.\nAn inadequate allowance for credit losses would\nreduce our earnings.\nWe are exposed\nto the risk that our clients may be unable to repay their loans\naccording to their terms and that any collateral\nsecuring the payment of their loans may not be sufficient\nto assure full repayment. This could result in credit losses that are\ninherent in the lending business. We\nevaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio\nand provide an allowance for credit losses\nthat we believe is adequate based upon such factors as:\n\u25cf\nthe risk characteristics of various classifications of loans;\n\u25cf\nprevious loan loss experience;\n\u25cf\nspecific loans that have loss potential;\n\u25cf\ndelinquency trends;\n\u25cf\nestimated fair market value of the collateral;\n\u25cf\ncurrent and future economic conditions; and\n\u25cf\ngeographic and industry loan concentrations.\nAt December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses was $23.8\nmillion, which represented approximately 1.19%\nof our total\nloans held for investment.\nWe had $5.9\nmillion in nonaccruing loans at December 31, 2020.\nThe allowance is based on\nmanagement\u2019s reasonable\nestimate and may not prove sufficient to cover future\nloan losses.\nAlthough management uses the best\ninformation available to make determinations with respect\nto the allowance for credit losses, future adjustments may be\nnecessary\nif economic conditions differ substantially from\nthe assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to our\nnonperforming or performing loans.\nIn addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their\nexamination process, periodically\nreview our estimated losses on loans.\nOur regulators may require us to recognize additional losses based\non their judgments about\ninformation available to them at the time of their examination.\nAccordingly, the allowance\nfor credit losses may not be adequate\nto cover all future loan losses and significant increases to\nthe allowance may be required in the future if, for\nexample, economic\nconditions worsen.\nA material increase in our allowance for credit losses would adversely\nimpact our net income and capital in\nfuture periods, while having the effect\nof overstating our current period earnings.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and\njeopardize our financial condition.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the\noperation of our business. We\nrequire sufficient liquidity to meet client loan\nrequests, client deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments\non our debt obligations as they come due and other cash\ncommitments under both normal operating conditions and\nother unpredictable circumstances causing industry or\ngeneral financial\nmarket stress. If we are unable to raise funds through\ndeposits, borrowings, earnings and other sources,\nit could have a substantial\nnegative effect on our liquidity.\nIn particular, a majority of our liabilities\nduring 2020 were checking accounts and other liquid\ndeposits, which are generally payable on demand\nor upon short notice. By comparison, a substantial majority\nof our assets were\nloans, which cannot generally be called or sold in the\nsame time frame. Although we have historically been able to replace\nmaturing deposits and advances as necessary,\nwe might not be able to replace such funds in the future,\nespecially if a large\nnumber of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts\nat the same time, regardless of the reason. Our access to funding\nsources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on\nterms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that\naffect us\nspecifically or the financial services industry or economy\nin general. Factors that could negatively impact our access\nto liquidity\nsources include a decrease in the level of our business activity\nas a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans\nare\nconcentrated, adverse regulatory action against us, or\nour inability to attract and retain deposits. Our ability to borrow\ncould also\nbe impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such\nas a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and\nexpectations\nabout the prospects for the financial services industry.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity,\nit could materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations\nor financial condition.\nWe may incur significant\ncosts associated with the ownership of real property\nas a result of foreclosures, which could\nreduce our net income.\nSince we originate loans secured by real estate, we may\nhave to foreclose on the collateral property to protect our investment\nand\nmay thereafter own and operate such property,\nin which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent\nin the ownership of real\nestate.\nThe amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after\na foreclosure is dependent upon factors outside\nof our control, including,\nbut not limited to:\n\u25cf\ngeneral or local economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental cleanup liability;\n\u25cf\nneighborhood values;\n\u25cf\ninterest rates;\n\u25cf\nreal estate tax rates;\n\u25cf\noperating expenses of the mortgaged properties;\n\u25cf\nsupply of and demand for rental units or properties;\n\u25cf\nability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the\nproperties;\n\u25cf\nzoning laws;\n\u25cf\ngovernmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and\n\u25cf\nacts of God.\nCertain expenditures associated with the ownership\nof real estate, including real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance\ncosts,\nmay adversely affect the income from the real\nestate. Furthermore, we may need to advance funds to continue\nto operate or to\nprotect these assets. As a result, the cost of operating\nreal property assets may exceed the rental income earned\nfrom such\nproperties or we may be required to dispose of the real property\nat a loss.\nCybersecurity and Technology\nRisks\nWe process, maintain,\nand transmit confidential client information through\nour information technology systems, such as\nour online banking service.\nCybersecurity issues, such as security breaches and computer\nviruses, affecting our\ninformation technology systems or fraud related\nto our debit card products could disrupt our business, result\nin the\nunintended disclosure or misuse of confidential or\nproprietary information, damage our reputation,\nincrease our costs,\nand cause losses.\nWe collect and\nstore sensitive data, including our proprietary business information\nand that of our clients, and personally\nidentifiable information of our clients and employees, in\nour\ninformation technology systems\n.\nWe also provide\nour clients the\nability to bank online.\nThe secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of\nthis information is critical to our operations.\nOur\nnetwork, or those of our clients, could be vulnerable to\nunauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and\nother\nsecurity problems.\nFinancial institutions and companies engaged in data processing\nhave increasingly reported breaches in the\nsecurity of their websites or other systems, some of which\nhave involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended\nto obtain\nunauthorized access to confidential information, destroy\ndata, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause\nother damage.\nWe may be\nrequired to spend significant capital and other resources to\nprotect against the threat of security breaches and\ncomputer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by\nsecurity breaches or viruses.\nSecurity breaches and viruses could expose us to\nclaims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability\nto prevent security breaches or computer viruses could\nalso cause\nexisting clients to lose confidence in our systems and\ncould adversely affect our reputation and our ability\nto generate deposits.\nAdditionally, fraud\nlosses related to debit and credit cards have risen in recent years due\nin large part to growing and evolving\nschemes to illegally use cards or steal consumer credit card\ninformation despite risk management practices employed\nby the debit\nand credit card industries. Many issuers of debit and\ncredit cards have suffered significant losses in recent years due\nto the theft of\ncardholder data that has been illegally exploited for\npersonal gain.\nThe potential for debit and credit card fraud against us or\nour clients and our third-party service providers is a serious\nissue. Debit\nand credit card fraud is pervasive and the risks of\ncybercrime are complex and continue to evolve. In view\nof the recent high-\nprofile retail data breaches involving client personal and\nfinancial information, the potential impact on us and any exposure\nto\nconsumer losses and the cost of technology investments\nto improve security could cause losses to us or our clients,\ndamage to our\nbrand, and an increase in our costs.\nInvestment Risks\nThe fair value of our investments could decline which would cause\na reduction in shareowners\u2019 equity.\nA large portion of our investment securities portfolio\nat December 31, 2020 has been designated as available-for-sale\npursuant to\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles relating\nto accounting for investments. Such principles require that\nunrealized gains\nand losses in the estimated value of the available-for-sale\nportfolio be \u201cmarked to market\u201d and reflected as a separate\nitem in\nshareowners\u2019 equity (net of tax) as accumulated\nother comprehensive income/losses. Shareowners\u2019 equity will\ncontinue to reflect\nthe unrealized gains and losses (net of tax) of these investments.\nThe fair value of our investment portfolio may decline, causing\na\ncorresponding decline in shareowners\u2019 equity.\nManagement believes that several factors will affect\nthe fair values of our investment portfolio. These include, but are\nnot limited\nto, changes in interest rates or expectations of changes\nin interest rates, the degree of volatility in the securities markets,\ninflation\nrates or expectations of inflation and the slope of the\ninterest rate yield curve (the yield curve refers to the differences\nbetween\nshort-term and long-term interest rates; a positively sloped yield\ncurve means short-term rates are lower than long-term rates).\nThese and other factors may impact specific categories\nof the portfolio differently,\nand we cannot predict the effect these factors\nmay have on any specific category.\nRegulatory and Legislative Risks\nWe are subject to\nextensive regulation, which could restrict\nour activities and impose financial requirements\nor limitations\non the conduct of our business.\nWe are subject\nto extensive regulation, supervision and examination\nby our regulators, including the Florida Office\nof Financial\nRegulation, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC. Our\ncompliance with these industry regulations is costly and restricts\ncertain of\nour activities, including payment of dividends, mergers\nand acquisitions, investments, lending and interest rates charged\non loans,\ninterest rates paid on deposits, access to capital and brokered\ndeposits and locations of banking offices. If\nwe are unable to meet\nthese regulatory requirements, our financial condition,\nliquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely\naffected.\nOur activities are also regulated under consumer protection\nlaws applicable to our lending, deposit and other activities. Many\nof\nthese regulations are intended primarily for the\nprotection of our depositors and the Deposit Insurance\nFund and not for the\nbenefit of our shareowners. In addition to the regulations\nof the bank regulatory agencies, as a member of the Federal\nHome Loan\nBank, we must also comply with applicable regulations\nof the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Federal Home Loan\nBank.\nOur failure to comply with these laws and regulations\ncould subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and\nother\npenalties, any of which could adversely affect\nour results of operations, capital base and the price of our\nsecurities. Further, any\nnew laws, rules and regulations could make compliance\nmore difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely\naffect our business and\nfinancial condition. Please refer to the Section entitled \u201cBusiness\n- Regulatory Considerations\u201d on page 9.\nU.S. federal banking agencies may require\nus to increase our regulatory capital,\nlong-term debt or liquidity requirements,\nwhich could result in the need to issue additional qualifying\nsecurities or to take other actions, such as to sell company\nassets.\nWe are subject\nto U.S. regulatory capital and liquidity rules. These rules,\namong other things, establish minimum requirements to\nqualify as a well-capitalized institution. If CCB fails to maintain\nits status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory\ncapital rules, the Federal Reserve will require us to agree\nto bring the bank back to well-capitalized status. For the duration\nof\nsuch an agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose restrictions\non our activities. If we were to fail to enter into or comply with\nsuch an agreement, or fail to comply with the terms of\nsuch agreement, the Federal Reserve may impose more severe restrictions\non our activities, including requiring us to cease and\ndesist activities permitted under the Bank Holding Company\nAct of 1956.\nCapital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced\nand amended. It is possible that regulators may increase\nregulatory\ncapital requirements, change how regulatory capital is calculated\nor increase liquidity requirements.\nIn 2013, the Federal Reserve Board released its final rules\nwhich implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory\ncapital\nreforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\nand certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under\nthe final\nrule, minimum requirements increased for both the quality\nand quantity of capital held by banking organizations.\nConsistent with\nthe international Basel framework, the rule includes a new\nminimum ratio of Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital, or CET1, to Risk-\nWeighted Assets, or\nRWA,\nof 4.5% and a CET1 conservation buffer\nof 2.5% of RWA\n(which was fully phased-in in 2019) that\napply to all supervised financial institutions.\nThe CET1 conservation buffer requirement\nrequires us to hold additional CET1\ncapital in excess of the minimum required to meet the CET1 to\nRWA\nratio requirement. The rule also, among other\nthings, raised\nthe minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to\nRWA\nfrom 4% to 6% and included a minimum leverage ratio\nof 4% for all banking\norganizations. The impact of the new capital\nrules requires us to maintain higher levels of capital, which\nwe expect will lower our\nreturn on equity.\nAdditionally, if our CET1\nto RWA\nratio does not exceed the minimum required plus the additional\nCET1\nconservation buffer,\nwe may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends or make other\ndistributions of capital to our shareowners.\nFurther changes to and compliance with the regulatory\ncapital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations\nby requiring\nus to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional\nequity or other securities, cease or alter certain operations, sell\ncompany assets or hold highly liquid assets, which may\nadversely affect our results of operations. We\nmay be prohibited from\ntaking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends\nor repurchasing securities.\nChanges in accounting standards or assumptions in applying\naccounting policies could adversely affect us.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to\nhow we record and report our financial condition and results of\noperations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and\nassumptions that may affect the reported value of\nour assets or\nliabilities and results of operations and are critical because\nthey require management to make difficult, subjective\nand complex\njudgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nIf those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly\nmade, we\ncould be required to correct and restate prior-period financial\nstatements. Accounting standard-setters and those who\ninterpret the\naccounting standards, the SEC, banking regulators and our\nindependent registered public accounting firm may also amend or\neven\nreverse their previous interpretations or positions on how\nvarious standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult\nto\npredict and could impact how we prepare and report\nour financial statements. In some cases, we could be\nrequired to apply a new\nor revised standard retrospectively,\nresulting in us revising prior-period financial statements.\nFlorida financial institutions, such as CCB, face a\nhigher risk of noncompliance and enforcement actions with\nthe Bank\nSecrecy Act and other anti-money laundering\nstatutes and regulations.\nSince September 11, 2001, banking\nregulators have intensified their focus on anti-money laundering\nand Bank Secrecy Act\ncompliance requirements, particularly the anti-money laundering\nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT\nAct. There is also increased\nscrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.\nSince 2004, federal banking\nregulators and examiners have been extremely aggressive\nin their supervision and examination of financial institutions located\nin\nthe State of Florida with respect to the institution\u2019s\nBank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance. Consequently,\nnumerous formal enforcement actions have been instituted\nagainst financial institutions. If CCB\u2019s po\nlicies, procedures and\nsystems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures\nand systems of the financial institutions that it has already\nacquired or\nmay acquire in the future are deficient, CCB would be subject\nto liability, including\nfines and regulatory actions such as\nrestrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity\nto obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain\naspects of its\nbusiness plan, including its acquisition plans.\nStructural and Organizational Risks\nOur directors, executive officers, and principal\nshareowners, if acting together,\nhave substantial control over all matters\nrequiring shareowner approval,\nincluding changes of control. Because Mr.\nWilliam G. Smith, Jr.\nis a principal\nshareowner and our Chairman, President,\nand Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of CCB, he\nhas substantial control\nover all matters on a day to day basis.\nOur directors, executive officers, and principal\nshareowners beneficially owned approximately 20.1% of the\noutstanding shares of\nour common stock at December 31, 2020.\nWilliam G. Smith, Jr.,\nour Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nbeneficially owned 17.1% of our shares as of that date.\nAccordingly, these directors,\nexecutive officers, and principal\nshareowners, if acting together,\nmay be able to influence or control matters requiring approval\nby our shareowners, including the\nelection of directors and the approval of mergers,\nacquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. Moreover,\nbecause William G.\nSmith, Jr. is the Chairman,\nPresident, and Chief Executive Officer of CCBG and Chairman\nof CCB, he has substantial control\nover all matters on a day-to-day basis, including the\nnomination and election of directors.\nThese directors, executive officers, and\nprincipal shareowners may also have interests that differ\nfrom yours and may vote in a\nway with which you disagree and which may be adverse\nto your interests. The concentration of ownership may have the effect\nof\ndelaying, preventing or deterring a change of control\nof our company, could deprive\nour shareowners of an opportunity to receive\na premium for their common stock as part of a sale of\nour Company and might ultimately affect the\nmarket price of our common\nstock. You\nmay also have difficulty changing management, the composition\nof the Board of Directors, or the general direction of\nour Company.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and certain laws and\nregulations may prevent or delay\ntransactions you might\nfavor,\nincluding a sale or merger of CCBG.\nCCBG is registered with the Federal Reserve as a financial\nholding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, or\nBHC Act.\nAs a result, we are subject to supervisory regulation\nand examination by the Federal Reserve. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,\nthe\nBHC Act, and other federal laws subject financial holding\ncompanies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in\nwhich\nthey may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and\nactivities, including regulatory enforcement actions for\nviolations of laws and regulations.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, certain\nlaws and regulations and various other factors may make\nit more\ndifficult and expensive for companies or persons\nto acquire control of us without the consent of our Board of\nDirectors. It is\npossible, however, that you would\nwant a takeover attempt to succeed because, for example, a potential\nbuyer could offer a\npremium over the then prevailing price of our common\nstock.\nFor example, our Articles of Incorporation permit our\nBoard of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareowner\naction. The\nability to issue preferred stock could discourage a company\nfrom attempting to obtain control of us by means of a tender\noffer,\nmerger, proxy contest or\notherwise. Additionally, although\nthere is a proposal to declassify our Board of Directors that\nis to be\nvoted upon and potentially implemented at our 2021 annual\nmeeting of shareowners, our Articles of Incorporation\nand Bylaws\ncurrently divide our Board of Directors into three classes, as nearly\nequal in size as possible, with staggered three-year terms. One\nclass is elected each year.\nThe classification of our Board of Directors could make it more\ndifficult for a company to acquire\ncontrol of us. We\nare also subject to certain provisions of the Florida Business Corporation\nAct and our Articles of Incorporation\nthat relate to business combinations with interested shareowners.\nOther provisions in our Articles of Incorporation or\nBylaws that\nmay discourage takeover attempts or make them more\ndifficult include:\n\u25cf\nSupermajority voting requirements to remove a director from office;\n\u25cf\nProvisions regarding the timing and content of shareowner\nproposals and nominations;\n\u25cf\nSupermajority voting requirements to amend Articles of Incorporation\nunless approval is received by a majority of\n\u201cdisinterested directors\u201d;\n\u25cf\nAbsence of cumulative voting; and\n\u25cf\nInability for shareowners to take action by written consent.\nGeneral Risks\nRisk of Pandemic.\nIn recent years the outbreak of a number of diseases including\nCOVID-19, Avian\nBird Flu, H1N1, and various other \"super bugs\"\nhave increased the risk of a pandemic. As seen with the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic and prior pandemics, global\nevents like\nthese could impact interest rates, energy\nprices, the value of financial assets and ultimately economic\nactivity in our markets.\nThe\nadverse effect of these events may include narrowing\nof the spread between interest income and expense, a\nreduction in fee\nincome, an increase in credit losses, and a decrease in\ndemand for loans and other products and services.\nWe may be unable to\npay dividends in the future.\nIn 2020, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly\ncash dividends. Declarations of any future dividends will be contingent\non\nour ability to earn sufficient profits and\nto remain well capitalized, including our ability to hold and generate\nsufficient capital to\ncomply with the CET1 conservation buffer\nrequirement. In addition, due to our contractual obligations\nwith the holders of our\ntrust preferred securities, if we defer the payment of accrued\ninterest owed to the holders of our trust preferred securities,\nwe may\nnot make dividend payments to our shareowners.\nFurther, under applicable statutes and\nregulations, CCB\u2019s board\nof directors, after charging-off bad debts,\ndepreciation and other\nworthless assets, if any,\nand making provisions for reasonably anticipated future losses on\nloans and other assets, may quarterly,\nsemi-annually,\nor annually declare and pay dividends to CCBG of up\nto the aggregate net income of that period combined with\nthe CCB\u2019s retained net\nincome for the preceding two years and, with the approval\nof the Florida Office of Financial Regulation\nand Federal Reserve, declare a dividend from retained net\nincome which accrued prior to the preceding\ntwo years.\nAdditional\nstate laws generally applicable to Florida corporations may\nalso limit our ability to declare and pay dividends. Thus, our ability to\nfund future dividends may be restricted by state and\nfederal laws and regulations.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability\nto compete effectively in the highly competitive banking\nindustry.\nWe face vigorous\ncompetition for deposits, loans and other financial services in\nour market area from other banks and financial\ninstitutions, including savings and loan associations, savings\nbanks, finance companies and credit unions. A number\nof our\ncompetitors\nare significantly larger than we are and have greater access\nto capital and other resources. Many of our competitors\nalso have higher lending limits, more expansive branch\nnetworks, and offer a wider array of financial\nproducts and services. To\na\nlesser extent, we also compete with other providers of\nfinancial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage\nfirms,\nconsumer finance companies, insurance companies and\ngovernmental organizations, which may offer\nfinancial products and\nservices on more favorable terms than we are able\nto. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive\nregulations that govern our activities. As a result, these non\n-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain\nservices. The effect of this competition may\nreduce or limit our margins or our market share and\nmay adversely affect our results\nof operations and financial condition.\nLimited trading activity for shares of our common\nstock may contribute to price volatility.\nWhile our common stock is listed and traded on the\nNasdaq Global Select Market, there has historically been limited\ntrading\nactivity in our common stock.\nThe average daily trading volume of our common stock\nover the 12-month period ending\nDecember 31, 2020 was approximately 35,125 shares. Due\nto the limited trading activity of our common stock, relativity small\ntrades may have a significant impact on the price of\nour common stock.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to\ncover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact\non its market price.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend\nin part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish\nabout us\nand our business. We\ndo not have any control over securities analysts and\nthey may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our\ncommon stock. If securities analysts do not cover our\ncommon stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely\naffect its\nmarket price. If we are covered by securities analysts, and\nour common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, our stock\nprice would likely decline. If one or more of these\nanalysts ceases to cover our Company or fails to publish regular reports on\nus,\nwe could lose visibility in the financial markets,\nwhich may cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nShares of our common stock are not\nan insured deposit and may lose value.\nThe shares of our common stock are not a bank deposit and\nwill not be insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any\nother\ngovernment agency.\nYour\ninvestment will be subject to investment risk, and you must be capable\nof affording the loss of your\nentire investment.", "PERMNO": 84516, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CCBG"}
