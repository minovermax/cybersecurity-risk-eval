{"cik": "1360886", "company": "OSIRIS THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nUntil fiscal 2009, we incurred losses in each year since our inception, and may incur additional losses over the next several years. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $203.5 million. These losses resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity, total assets and working capital.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in the foreseeable future as we seek to:\n\u2022 Complete our confirmatory Phase III quality random clinical trial with Grafix for complex diabetic foot wounds with exposed tendon or bone;\n\u2022 continue other studies and initiate and pursue additional studies and possible clinical trials for our Biosurgery products, including Grafix for venus leg ulcers, which we have begun, and possibly other potential indications;\n\u2022 manage regulatory issues and requirements related to the marketing and distribution of our products and product candidates, including issues related to FDA approval and third party payor reimbursement;\n\u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property; and\n\u2022 continue to add sales, operational, financial, accounting, facilities engineering and information systems personnel, consistent with expanding our operations.\nThe extent of our future operating losses or profits is highly uncertain, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. If we are unable to achieve and then maintain profitability, the market value of our common stock will decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nThe current credit and financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risk affecting our business.\nWe rely upon third parties for certain aspects of our business, including collaboration partners, wholesale distributors, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and third-party suppliers. Because of the tightened global credit and continuing volatility in the financial markets, there may be a delay or disruption in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent on the skills, experience and efforts of our scientific, management, and sales personnel. These include Lode Debrabandere Ph.D., Alla Danilkovitch, Ph.D., Philip R. Jacoby, Jr., and Frank Czworka. We also rely upon the guidance and experience of Peter Friedli, the Chairman of our Board of Directors. The loss of any or all of these individuals could harm our business and might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research, development or business objectives. We are party to an employment agreement with Dr. Debrabandere. The existence of an employment agreement does not, however, guarantee retention of any officer or employee, and we may not be able to retain any of these individuals, whether or not we have an employment agreement with them. Except for Dr. Debrabandere, none of our employees is employed for a specified term. Competition for personnel is intense. We may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract or integrate other qualified management and scientific personnel in the future.\nThe potential of our Biosurgery products and products under development to treat conditions may not be realized.\nWe are continually evaluating the potential of our Biosurgery products and products under development. Our products are susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate efficacy or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their commercial use, or if required, marketing approval. If the treatment potential of our products is not realized, the value of our technology, our development programs and our products could be significantly reduced. Because our Biosurgery products are comprised of human tissue, any negative developments regarding the therapeutic potential or side effects of human tissue products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product development programs are based on novel technologies and are inherently risky.\nWe are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on new technologies. The novel nature of our products and product candidates creates significant challenges in regards to product development and optimization, processing and manufacturing, government regulation, third-party reimbursement and market acceptance. For example, questions persist with regard to the necessity of FDA approval for some cell-based products, and therefore, the pathway to commercialization of our Biosurgery products may be more complex and lengthy. Additionally, cell-based products are subject to donor-to-donor variability, which can make standardization more difficult. As a result, the development and commercialization pathway for our products may be subject to increased uncertainty, as compared to the pathway for conventional products.\nOur Biosurgery products represent new classes of therapy that the marketplace may not understand or accept.\nThe market may not understand or accept our products. We are developing products that represent novel treatments or therapies and which will compete with a number of more conventional products and therapies manufactured and marketed by others, including major pharmaceutical companies. The novel nature of our Biosurgery products creates significant challenges in regards to product development and optimization, manufacturing, government regulation, and third-party reimbursement. As a result, the development pathway for our Biosurgery products may be subject to increased scrutiny, as compared to the pathway for more conventional products.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any of our developed or potential products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the clinical safety and effectiveness of our products and their perceived advantage over alternative treatment methods;\n\u2022 our ability to convince health care providers that the use of our products in a particular procedure is more beneficial than the standard of care or other available methods;\n\u2022 our ability to explain clearly and educate others on the use of human placental tissue, to avoid potential confusion with and differentiate ourselves from the ethical controversies associated with human fetal tissue;\n\u2022 ethical controversies that may arise regarding the use of human tissue of any kind, including tissues derived from deceased donor, and distribution for profit of our deceased donor products;\n\u2022 adverse reactions involving our biosurgery products or the products or product candidates of others that are human tissue based;\n\u2022 our ability to supply a sufficient amount of our product to meet regular and repeated demand in order to develop a core group of medical professionals familiar with and committed to the use of our products; and\n\u2022 the cost of our products and the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors.\nIf the health care community does not accept our potential products for any of the foregoing reasons, or for any other reason, it could affect our sales, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe successful commercialization and distribution of our Biosurgery products will depend on obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors.\nWe distribute our Biosurgery products in the United States. We may expand our distribution to other countries in the future. In the United States and elsewhere, the market for any pharmaceutical or therapeutic product is affected by the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit management companies. Biosurgery products like Grafix, Cartiform and BIO4 may have higher costs or fees associated with them compared with more traditional products, due to the higher cost and complexity associated with their research, development and production, and the complexity associated with their distribution-which requires special handling, storage and shipment procedures and protocols. This, in turn, may make it more difficult for us to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, particularly if we cannot demonstrate a favorable cost-benefit relationship. Third-party payors may also deny coverage or offer inadequate levels of reimbursement for our products if they determine that the product has not received appropriate clearances from the FDA or other government regulators or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate.\nIn the countries of Europe and in some other countries, the pricing of prescription and therapeutic products and services, and reimbursement, are subject to increased governmental control. In addition, many other countries require pre-marketing approval for human tissue based products, or otherwise more extensively regulate human tissue based products than does the United States.\nRegardless of whether we are required to conduct a successful clinical trial in order to market a product in the United States or a foreign country, we may nevertheless be required to conduct one or more clinical trials, and to publish one or more peer reviewed journal articles supporting the product, before we are able to obtain third party reimbursement. We may also be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our products to other available therapies before third party payors will provide reimbursement. Conducting clinical trials is expensive and will result in delays in wide scale commercialization and reimbursement. Publishing of peer reviewed journal articles may also be costly and result in delays. In addition, even if our products otherwise meet the requirements for reimbursement, pricing negotiations with third party payors may take months and result in significant delay in obtaining approval for reimbursement.\nReimbursement policies also sometimes differ depending upon the setting in which the product is to be used. The use of our Biosurgery products in a hospital setting as part of a surgical or other more extensive procedure may have a reimbursement pathway that differs from a use in an outpatient setting for a more narrowly defined procedure. Thus, for example, the reimbursement pathway for Grafix-which we expect to be used more often in an outpatient setting-may differ from that for BIO4-which we expect to be used more often in an in-patient hospital setting as part of a surgical procedure.\nThese differences may limit or make reimbursement more difficult for some products as compared to others, and influence our product development and marketing efforts in ways that may ultimately prove to be detrimental to us or our business.\nManaging and reducing health care costs has been a general concern of federal and state governments in the United States and of foreign governments. Although we do not believe that any recently enacted or presently proposed U.S. legislation should impact our business specifically and negatively as compared to other health care product businesses generally, we might nevertheless be subject to future regulations or other cost-control initiatives that materially restrict the price we receive for our products. In addition, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and many limit reimbursement for newly approved health care products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the indications for which they will reimburse patients who use any products that we may develop. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price for products that we may develop, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nOur dependence upon human tissue necessary to produce our Biosurgery products may impact our ability to produce these products on a large scale.\nOur Biosurgery products consist of human tissue. This tissue is obtained by us from not-for-profit donor procurement agencies. Grafix is processed from human placental tissue. BIO4 is processed from deceased donor bone. Cartiform is processed from deceased donor cartilage. While we are not aware of significant supply issues, and placental tissue and deceased donor bone and cartilage is generally available to us, the supplier agencies may not be able to provide us with sufficient amounts of tissue to meet the demand. In addition, the use of human tissue as a treatment for human disease and medical conditions has increased over recent years and continues to increase, creating greater and continually increasing competition and demand for donated human tissue. Even if we are successful in our efforts to expand our compliment of Biosurgery products, we may not be able to secure quantities of human tissue sufficient to meet the demand.\nOur Biosurgery products are derived from human tissue and therefore have the potential for disease transmission.\nThe utilization of human tissue creates the potential for transmission of communicable disease, including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral hepatitis, syphilis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or the human form of \"mad cow\" disease, and other viral, fungal or bacterial pathogens. Although we are required to comply with federal and state regulations intended to prevent communicable disease transmission, and our suppliers of adult human bone, cartilage and placental tissue are also required to comply with such regulations in connection with their collection, storage and supply to us:\n\u2022 we or our suppliers may fail to comply with such regulations;\n\u2022 even with compliance, our products might nevertheless be viewed by the public as being associated with transmission of disease; and\n\u2022 a patient that contracts an infectious disease might assert that the use of our products resulted in disease transmission, even if the patient became infected through another source.\nAny actual or alleged transmission of communicable disease could result in patient claims, litigation, distraction of management's attention and potentially increased expenses. Further, any failure in screening, whether by us or other manufacturers of similar products, could adversely affect our reputation, the support we receive from the medical community and overall demand for our products. As a result, such actions or claims, whether or not directed at us, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation with our customers and our ability to distribute our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to process our Biosurgery products in sufficient quantities to expand our market for the products.\nWe may encounter difficulties in the production of our Biosurgery products due to our limited manufacturing capabilities. This difficulty could reduce redistribution efforts of our products, increase our distribution costs or cause production delays, any of which could damage our reputation and effect our operations. Even if we have access to quantities of human tissue sufficient to allow us otherwise to expand our manufacturing capabilities, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of the product at an acceptable cost, or at all.\nWe use or may use third-party collaborators to help us develop and commercialize our products, and our ability to commercialize such products may be impaired or delayed if collaborations are unsuccessful.\nWe have arrangements in place with third-party collaborators as a means to help us with research and development efforts or marketing and distribution. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our dependence upon our collaborative relationships, including:\n\u2022 our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them;\n\u2022 we cannot control the quality, amount and timing of our collaborators' resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them, and our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed or commercialized in collaboration with us;\n\u2022 refusal to or failure of our collaborators to perform their responsibilities in a timely manner, including breach;\n\u2022 the right of the collaborator to terminate its collaboration agreement with us for reasons outside our control, and in some cases on limited notice;\n\u2022 business combinations and changes in a collaborator's business strategy may adversely affect the party's willingness or ability to complete its obligations;\n\u2022 loss of significant rights to our collaborative parties if we fail to meet our obligations;\n\u2022 disagreements as to ownership of clinical trial results or regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 the ability of a collaborator to successfully market and promote our products;\n\u2022 withdrawal of support by a collaborator following development or acquisition by the collaborator of competing products; and\n\u2022 disagreements with a collaborator regarding the collaboration agreement or ownership of intellectual property or other proprietary rights.\nDue to these factors and other possible events, we could suffer delays in the research, development or commercialization of our products or we may become involved in litigation or arbitration, which would be time consuming and expensive.\nOur most significant collaborative arrangement is with a subsidiary of Stryker Corporation, and our success may depend upon performance on the part of Stryker and the success of this collaboration. We are also dependent upon our exclusive partnership with Arthrex, Inc. for the commercial distribution of Cartiform, and may enter into and become dependent upon additional collaborations in the future.\nWe are party to an Exclusive Service Agreement with Howmedica Osteonics Corp., also referred to as Stryker Orthopaedics, a subsidiary of Stryker Corporation (\"Stryker\"), for the commercialization of our viable bone matrix allograft under the name BIO4. Pursuant to the agreement, Stryker is the exclusive worldwide marketer and promoter of allograft services for BIO4 for use in surgical applications, including spine, trauma, extremity, cranial, and foot and ankle surgery. This collaboration is subject to all of the risks and uncertainties applicable to collaborative arrangements generally, including those described above. In addition, this collaboration is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties specific to the transaction and the parties.\nThe agreement with Stryker provides for an initial four year exclusive term, commencing on the date of Stryker's initial commercial sale. The term may be extended by Stryker for an additional exclusive period of four years or an additional non-exclusive period of two years. If Stryker extends the term on an exclusive basis, it has the option to further extend the term on an exclusive basis for two years. Osiris is entitled to receive an initial exclusivity fee of $5,000,000 and additional fees upon any exercise by Stryker of its right to extend the initial term, whether on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. These additional fees are reduced on a sliding scale if Stryker meets certain revenue thresholds during the initial term, or if revenue goals are not met as a result of Osiris not fulfilling its supply obligations. Stryker is entitled to a certain percentage of sales of allograft services for BIO4 and has limited early termination rights. The success of this collaboration for us will in part be dependent upon Stryker, including its success in marketing and promoting BIO4.\nStryker has significantly greater resources that we do, and this collaboration is not as core to its business as it is to ours. We are dependent upon Stryker's continued performance under this collaboration, and any determination by Stryker not to proceed or perform, or any material adverse event that affects Stryker's ability or desire to perform may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are also dependent upon our exclusive commercial and development partnership with Arthrex, Inc., to which we have granted exclusive commercial distribution rights for Cartiform, and any determination by Stryker not to proceed or perform, or any material adverse event that affects Stryker's ability or desire to perform may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may also enter into additional collaborations in the future. We are dependent upon our current collaborators, and will be dependent upon any future collaborators, in performing their responsibilities in connection with the relevant collaboration. If we fail to maintain our existing or any future collaborative relationships for any reason, we would need to undertake on our own and at our own expense, or find other collaborators, to perform the activities we currently anticipate will be performed by our collaborators. This may substantially increase our cash requirements. We may not have the capability or financial capacity to undertake these activities on our own, or we may not be able to find other collaborators on acceptable terms, or at all. This may limit the programs we are able to pursue and result in significant delays in the development, sale and manufacture of our products, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe distribute products through distribution arrangements that sometimes involve the consignment of inventory to third parties, which results in additional risk and uncertainty as to the viability of consigned inventory and as to inventory accounting.\nWe have historically distributed our Biosurgery products either ourselves or through third party distributors who sometimes take possession of our inventory on a consignment basis, or through a\ncombination of both methods. In some situations, we store consigned inventory on site in freezers at hospital or clinic facilities. We commercialize Grafix through the efforts of our own focused direct distribution and marketing staff, as well as through a network of specialty distributors for certain target markets. Like Ovation and OvationOS, Bio4 will sometimes be commercialized through a consignment arrangement, and our agreement with Stryker includes consignment terms, as does our agreement with Arthrex for Cartiform. Because our consigned inventory must be stored at -80 C, it is at risk of thawing, resulting in the loss of that inventory. That risk of loss of is borne by us, although we believe that we maintain adequate insurance to cover the risk. Inventory management is complicated by a consignment arrangement, as is revenue recognition and inventory and receivables accounting. Thus, for example, no revenue is recognized upon the placement of inventory into consignment, as we retain title and maintain the inventory on our balance sheet. For these products, revenue is recognized when we receive appropriate notification that the product has been used in a surgical procedure. This may not occur in a timely manner, meaning that our financial statements may not always reflect our actual inventory and receivables balances as of the end of a fiscal period. We monitor and verify the condition and status of all consigned inventory on at least a quarterly basis, at additional expense to us. In addition, FDA, AATB and other accrediting agency rules, regulations or standards require that we monitor our consigned inventory, and require tracking of human tissue and inventory as it moves through the supply chain. Moreover, as is the case with all of our inventory, should the FDA or any other regulatory authority determine that we are unable for any reason to continue to distribute consigned inventory, either on account of the viability of that inventory or because of the withdraw of necessary approvals or other qualifications allowing for the distribution and sale of that inventory, the value of that inventory may have to be written off and our balance sheet adjusted accordingly. The complexity of our inventory management, or the application of rules, regulations and standards to our product inventory, or the occurrence of any of these negative events, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently dependent upon third-parties for services and raw materials needed for the processing of our Biosurgery products, and for distribution.\nIn order to produce our Biosurgery products we require biological media, reagents and other highly specialized materials. This is in addition to the human tissue donations used to manufacture our biosurgery products. These items must be manufactured and supplied to us in sufficient quantities and in compliance with cGMP. To meet these requirements, we have entered into supply agreements with firms that manufacture these components to cGMP standards.\nWe expect to continue to rely on third parties to sell or redistribute our biosurgery products. Proper shipping and distribution requires compliance with specific storage and shipment procedures. Failure to comply with these procedures or the occurrence of inadvertent damage to the shipping container will necessitate return and replacement, potentially resulting in additional cost and causing us to fail to meet supply requirements. If any of these third parties fail or are unable to perform in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture and deliver could be compromised, and our business would be harmed.\nOur dependence on third parties may increase the risk that we will not have adequate quantities of our biosurgery products.\nOur Biosurgery product supply chain and processing infrastructure depends on the performance of a number of complex contracts between us on the one hand and our suppliers and redistributors on the other. If any of our suppliers, distributors or other business partners cannot or do not perform their contractual obligations, then our production efforts may suffer. If we cannot or do not perform our contractual obligations, then we may be subject to arbitration, mediation or litigation that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nReliance on third-parties entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured such components ourselves, including:\n\u2022 reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party; and\n\u2022 the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nOur suppliers, distributors and other third parties with which we contract are subject to many or all of the risks and uncertainties that we are subject to. Similar to us, they are subject to ongoing, periodic, unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to ensure strict compliance with cGMP regulations and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards. However, we do not control compliance with these regulations and standards by our suppliers, distributors and other third parties with which we contract. They might not be able to comply with these regulatory requirements. If they fail to comply with applicable regulations, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could impose sanctions on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, denial of any required marketing approval, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, product seizures or recalls, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these actions could significantly and adversely affect the supply of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our processing and storage facility is damaged or destroyed, our business and prospects would be negatively affected.\nIf our processing and storage facility or the equipment in the facility were to be significantly damaged or destroyed, we could suffer a loss of some or all of the stored product, raw and other materials, and work in process.\nWe lease approximately 61,203 square feet of space in Columbia, Maryland that houses essentially all of our corporate operations. Currently, we maintain insurance coverage totaling $22.8 million against damage to our property and equipment, an additional $5.0 million to cover business interruption and extra expenses, and $7.3 million to cover R&D restoration expenses. If we have underestimated our insurance needs, we will not have sufficient insurance to cover losses above and beyond the limits on our policies.\nEthical, legal and other concerns surrounding the use of human tissue may negatively affect public perception of us or our products, or may result in increased scrutiny of our products and product candidates from a regulatory approval perspective, thereby reducing demand for our products, restricting our ability to market our products, or adversely affecting the market price for our common stock.\nThe commercial success of our Biosurgery products depends in part on general public acceptance of the use of human tissue for the treatment of human diseases and other conditions. While not as controversial as the use of embryonic stem cells and fetal tissue, the use of placental tissue and adult tissue has been the subject of substantial debate regarding related ethical, legal and social issues. We do not use embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue, but the public may not be able to, or may fail to, differentiate our use of placental or adult tissue from the use by others of embryonic stem cells or fetal tissue. Ethical concerns have been raised by some about the use of donated human tissue in a for-profit setting. This could result in a negative perception of our company or our products.\nFuture adverse events in the field of cellular based therapy or changes in public policy could also result in greater governmental regulation of our products and potential regulatory uncertainty or delay relating to any required testing or approval.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources or capabilities than we have, or may succeed in developing better products or in developing products more quickly than we do.\nIn the marketplace, we compete with other companies and organizations that are marketing or developing products competitive with Grafix and our other Biosurgery products and products under development. In many cases, the competing product or candidate is based on traditional pharmaceutical, medical device or other therapies and technologies. Competitors competing with our Biosurgery products include, but are not limited to: Organogenesis, the manufacturer of Apligraf and Dermagraft and MiMedx, the manufacturer of EpiFix which competes with Grafix. BIO4 competes with bone tissue products such as Osteocel\u00ae and Trinity\u00ae, while Cartiform competes with cartilage allografts. In addition to those listed above, we have other existing and potential competitors developing a variety of treatments and therapies for the same conditions for which we market our products.\nWe also face competition in the cellular regenerative field from academic institutions and governmental agencies. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and human resources than we have, including more experience in research and development and more established marketing and distribution capabilities.\nWe anticipate that competition in our industry will increase. In addition, the health care industry is characterized by rapid technological change, resulting in new product introductions and other technological advancements. Our competitors may develop and market products that render products now or in the future under development by us, or any products manufactured or marketed by us, non-competitive or otherwise obsolete.\nThe use of our Biosurgery products in human subjects may expose us to product liability claims, and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims. None of our products have been widely used over an extended period of time, and therefore our safety data is limited. We derive the raw materials for our products from human donor sources, the production process is complex, and the handling requirements are specific, all of which increase the likelihood of quality failures and subsequent product liability claims. We may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at all. If we are unable to obtain insurance, or if claims against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted. Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and could result in, among other things:\n\u2022 significant awards against us;\n\u2022 substantial litigation costs;\n\u2022 recall of the product;\n\u2022 injury to our reputation;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial participants; or\n\u2022 adverse regulatory action.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to costs incurred in product development and management of the regulatory approval and reimbursement processes, we will incur additional operating expenses in connection with the expansion of our Biosurgery business.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in connection with our planned expansion of our biosurgery business, as we seek to:\n\u2022 continue to develop, expand and support our distribution network of third party distributors and independent sales professionals for the distribution of Grafix, BIO4 and other Biosurgery products;\n\u2022 continue to expand and support our internal sales force and marketing capabilities, through the hiring of sales and marketing professionals and building an internal sales and marketing organization;\n\u2022 hire additional manufacturing, quality control, and quality assurance, and management personnel as necessary to expand our processing operations;\n\u2022 expand our processing capacity for our Biosurgery products, which will require that we maintain a portion of our space as an FDA compliant and validated product manufacturing facility; and\n\u2022 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio for our Biosurgery products.\nOur redistribution fees from our Biosurgery products have been limited to date. Our ability to scale up our production capabilities for larger quantities of these products remains to be proven. Our costs in marketing and distributing these products will also increase as production increases.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Government Regulations\nShould the FDA determine that any of our products do not meet regulatory requirements that permit qualifying human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products to be processed, stored, labeled and distributed without pre-marketing approval, we may be required to stop processing and distributing such products, or to narrow the indications for which those products are marketed.\nThe FDA has developed a tiered, risk-based regulatory framework, which includes criteria for facility management, quality assurance, donor selection, and processing of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products. We believe that commercial sale of Grafix as a wound allograft for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, does not require pre-market approval by the FDA because we believe that this product meets the regulatory definition of human cells, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products, or so-called Part 361 HCT/Ps (meaning that they comply with section 361 of the Public Health Service At (PHSA) and 21 CFR 1271). We received an \"untitled letter\" dated September 26, 2013 from the FDA stating, among other things, that both Grafix and Ovation do not meet these regulatory requirements because they are dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for their primary function and are not intended for autologous use or allergenic use in a first or second degree relative; and that Ovation does not meet the minimal manipulation criterion. After discussions with, and providing additional information to, the FDA, we reached an agreement with the FDA confirming the regulatory status of Grafix and allowing the product to remain on the market as an HCT/P and without FDA pre-marketing approval, as a wound allograft for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. We further committed to the FDA that, before marketing Grafix for certain expanded indications, we would submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA and seek pre-marketing approval for any such additional indication. We also agreed to continue to transition our Ovation product line over to OvationOS (now branded as BIO4) by no later than the second half of 2014, which we did. In August 2014, we stopped distributing promotional materials for Ovation and ceased manufacturing the product. In October 2014, we stopped shipping Ovation from our Columbia, MD facilities. At December 31, 2014, we owned some units of Ovation\nlocated in the field for use in procedures by the end users. We believe that commercial distribution of BIO4, a viable bone matrix for bone growth, and Cartiform, a viable chondral allograft, does not require pre-market approval by the FDA because we believe that these products meet the regulatory definition of HCT/Ps.\nWe engage in ongoing discussion and communication with FDA representatives regarding the applicable regulatory requirements and pathways for our products and product candidates. The analysis and determination of compliance of a product with these regulatory requirements and pathways is complex and dependent upon numerous factors, and is readily subject to varying interpretations and conclusions. The FDA may not agree with our views on these matters. Should the FDA decide that Grafix, BIO4 or any of our other Biosurgery products do not meet the regulatory definition of HCT/Ps, we will not be able to produce and redistribute these products unless and until we submit a BLA and obtain pre-marketing approval from the FDA, which would require clinical trials and could take years to obtain, at significant expense. This or any other determination by the FDA that adversely affects our ability to produce or to market any of our products or product candidates would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to expand the marketing claims for Grafix and BIO4 is limited by Federal regulations, and will likely require the submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, and the receipt of pre-marketing approval from the FDA, for the particular indication.\nWe cannot process, market or distribute our Biosurgery products without compliance with the United States Food Drug and Cosmetics Act, and comparable laws in foreign countries. Part 361 HCT/Ps may be processed, stored and distributed in the United States without FDA approval, provided that the product complies with the requirements of Part 361 of the PHSA and 21 CFR 1271. Absent such compliance, a BLA is required as a condition to marketing and sale of the product. In order to obtain a BLA we would be required to conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective and obtain required regulatory approvals. This process is costly and the product may fail to perform as we expect. Moreover, a product may ultimately fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed successfully through preclinical or initial clinical testing. We would need to devote significant additional research and development, financial resources and personnel to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, if required.\nWe have initiated efforts to obtain a BLA for Grafix. For the current label indications, for Grafix and BIO4,we rely upon the exception to the BLA limits requirement afforded Part 361 HCT/Ps. However, compliance with these requirements our activities in respect of these products. For example, we will not be able to enhance tissue based products in a manner which would result in the product being more than \"minimally manipulated\" within the meaning of 21 CFR 1271. These and other limitations applicable to HCT/Ps limit the indications for which these products may be marketed. Moreover, the FDA continues to review and inspect marketed products, manufacturers and manufacturing facilities, and even if a BLA is not required initially, the FDA or its foreign equivalents may create additional regulatory burdens in the future or may reevaluate or modify current regulatory frameworks in a manner adverse to us. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility-including those of or associated with a competitor or competing product-may result in the imposition of additional restrictions on us or our products, including a withdrawal of the product from the market. This would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to conduct clinical trials properly and on schedule, or if any such clinical trials prove to be unsuccessful, we would be unable to secure sought after, or any required, regulatory approvals.\nWe are currently pursuing and in the future may pursue additional clinical trials for our Biosurgery products to enhance our ability to successfully market these products, or to obtain pre-marketing approval if required by the FDA for us to market certain products, or to market our products for expanded indications. Clinical trials are costly and time consuming. The completion of clinical trials may be delayed or terminated, or the costs may be increased, for many reasons, including, but not limited to, if:\n\u2022 the FDA does not grant permission to proceed and places the trial on clinical hold;\n\u2022 subjects do not enroll in our trials at the rate we expect;\n\u2022 subjects experience an unacceptable rate or severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022 third-party clinical investigators do not perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practice and regulatory requirements, or other third parties do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022 inspections of clinical trial sites by the FDA or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of research institutions participating in our clinical trials find regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action, suspend or terminate one or more sites, or prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications; or\n\u2022 one or more IRBs suspends or terminates the trial at an investigational site, precludes enrollment of additional subjects, or withdraws its approval of the trial.\nIf we are unable to conduct clinical trials properly and on schedule, any potential marketing benefit may be lost, the reputation of the product could be damaged, and any required marketing approval may be delayed or denied by the FDA.\nTissue based products are generally subjected to greater regulatory scrutiny in many other countries as compared to the United States. These requirements may be costly and result in delay or otherwise preclude the distribution of our Biosurgery products in some foreign countries, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues.\nTissue based products are regulated differently in different countries. We believe that commercial distribution of Grafix as a wound allograft for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, and the commercial distribution of BIO4, a viable bone matrix for bone growth, do not require pre-market approval by the FDA in the United States because we believe that these products meet the regulatory definition of human cells, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products, and qualify as Part 361 HCT/Ps. Many foreign jurisdictions have a different and more difficult regulatory pathway for human tissue based products, which may prohibit the distribution of these products until the applicable regulatory agencies grant marketing approval, or licensure. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and we may never seek such approvals, or if we do, we may never gain those approvals. Any sought after or required approvals in Europe will likely require that we conduct clinical trials, which are themselves are costly and time consuming, and subject to risk and uncertainty, and may prove to be unsuccessful. Any adverse events in our clinical trials for one of our products could negatively impact our other products.\nIf we seek regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere for our Biosurgery products, whether to enhance our ability to successfully market these products, or if we are required to do so by the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory agencies, we may not be successful.\nShould we decide to seek regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere for our Biosurgery products, or should we be required to obtain such approvals before we can market a product generally or for a specific indication, any of the following factors may cause marketing approval to be delayed, limited or denied:\n\u2022 our products will require significant pre-clinical and clinical development before applications for marketing approval can be filed with the FDA;\n\u2022 data obtained from preclinical and nonclinical animal testing and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways, and the FDA or its foreign counterpart may not agree with our interpretations;\n\u2022 it may take many years to complete the testing of our products, and failure can occur at any stage of the process;\n\u2022 negative or inconclusive results or adverse side effects during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate development efforts for product;\n\u2022 approval may be delayed if the FDA or its foreign counterpart requires us to expand the size and scope of the clinical trials; or\n\u2022 negative results from clinical trials or failure to obtain pre-marketing approval of a HCP/T product not otherwise requiring such approval may result in a negative public perception of the product and loss of market share and revenue.\nIf we seek marketing approval-whether or not then necessary to market a particular product-and that approval marketing approval is delayed, limited or denied, our ability to market products, and our ability to generate product sales, would be adversely affected.\nWe and our business are subject to rules and regulations regarding organ donation and transplantation.\nCompliance with the issued operating standards established by The American Association of Tissue Banks (\"AATB\") is a requirement in order to become a licensed tissue bank. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. We are licensed to have permits as a tissue bank in Maryland, California, New York and Florida.\nIn addition, procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act (\"NOTA\"), which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue, for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue that they provide to us for processing. We include in our pricing structure amounts paid to tissue banks to reimburse them for their expenses associated with the recovery and transportation of the tissue, in addition to certain costs associated with processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the tissue, marketing and medical education expenses, and costs associated with the development of tissue processing technologies. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we can recover in our pricing for our products, thereby reducing our future revenue and profitability. If we were to be found to have violated NOTA's prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we would potentially be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn Europe, regulations, if applicable, differ from one county to the next. Because of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in Europe, as well as for other countries, the approval process for human derived cell or tissue based medical products could be extensive, lengthy, expensive, and unpredictable. Our Biosurgery products are subject to the country's regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation, storage, and distribution of human tissues and cells and cellular or tissue-based products. These regulations include requirements for registration, listing, labeling, adverse-event reporting, and inspection and enforcement. Some countries have their own tissue banking regulations.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials that could expose us to environmental and other liability.\nWe have facilities in Maryland that are subject to various local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including chemicals, micro-organisms and various radioactive compounds used in connection with our research and development activities. In the United States, these laws include the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Test Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We cannot assure you that accidental contamination or injury to our employees and third parties from hazardous materials will not occur. We do not have insurance to cover claims arising from our use and disposal of these hazardous substances other than limited clean-up expense coverage for environmental contamination due to an otherwise insured peril, such as fire.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nGiven our patent position in regard to our Biosurgery products, if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how related to these products, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA significant amount of our technology, including our teaching regarding the processing of our Biosurgery products, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets or confidential know-how. In an effort to protect this proprietary information, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual's relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. For example, a portion of the processing methodology and know-how for Grafix is protected by trade secret or through confidentiality arrangements. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships.\nAlso, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or know-how.\nBecause FDA approval is generally not required for tissue based products which are not more than minimally manipulated, competitors might choose to enter this market and produce a substantially similar product, and we may not be able to prevent the marketing and distribution of any such similar products by others. Should others produce a substantially similar product, we will be subject to\nincreased competition and our potential revenues from redistribution of these Biosurgery products may be limited.\nMoreover, if our Biosurgery products infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or redistribution of the product that is the subject of the suit.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets or know-how would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our patent position does not adequately protect our products, others could compete against us more directly, which would harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe patent position of biotechnology companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has been the subject of much litigation. Neither the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office nor the courts has a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many biotechnology patents.\nThe claims of our existing U.S. patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may not confer on us significant commercial protection against competing products. Even if we hold patents or have patent rights through licenses or otherwise with respect to a particular product, third parties may challenge, narrow, invalidate, design around, or circumvent any patents now or hereafter owned, assigned or licensed to us. Patents with broader claims tend to be more vulnerable to challenge by other parties than patents with extremely narrow claims. Also, our pending patent applications may not issue, may issue with substantially narrower claims than currently pending claims, or we may not receive any additional patents. Further, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies. Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property.\nBecause of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. A significant amount of our technology, including our teaching regarding the production processes for our Biosurgery products, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. The lack of patent protection for our Biosurgery products reduces the barrier for entry by others and makes these products susceptible to increased competition, which could be harmful to our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, trade secrets and know-how, our competitive position would be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSignificant aspects of our Biosurgery product technology, especially the teaching regarding the manufacturing processes for these products, are unpatented and maintained by us as trade secrets or proprietary know-how. In an effort to protect these trade secrets and know-how, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to execute confidential disclosure agreements before the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of\nthe individual's relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nAdequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. The disclosure of our trade secrets or know-how would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, it will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, and the manufacture or distribution of our Biosurgery products, may infringe or be alleged to infringe patents owned by third parties and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights. There may be applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be enjoined from certain activities including a stop or delay in research, development, manufacturing or sales activities related to the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference and reexamination proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings before the patent offices for other countries (e.g. the European Patent Office) or similar adversarial proceedings, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace and, as a result, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others, disputes may arise as to the rights related to or resulting from the use of such intellectual property.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors, which could be expensive and time consuming.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how, or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights. Litigation, opposition or interference proceedings could result in substantial additional costs and diversion of management focus. If we are ultimately unable to protect our technology, trade secrets or know-how, we may be unable to operate profitably.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to protect our proprietary rights. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to enjoin the other party from using the technology at issue. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Interference proceedings brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. We may not be able, alone or with our collaborators and licensors, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, though we would seek protective orders where appropriate, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nThe biotechnology industry, including our fields of interest, is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. Accordingly, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond quickly to such change through the development and introduction of new products. Our ability to compete successfully against currently existing and future alternatives to our products, and against competitors who compete directly with us, will depend, in part, on our ability to: attract and retain skilled scientific and research personnel; develop technologically superior products; develop competitively priced products; obtain patent or required regulatory approvals for our products; and be early entrants to the market; manufacture, market and sell our products, independently or through collaborations. If a third party were to commercialize a competitive product, there is no assurance that we would have a basis for initiating patent infringement proceedings or that, if initiated, we would prevail in such proceedings.\nRisk Factors Regarding the Sale of our ceMSC Business\nWe may not receive all of the payments available to us under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and accordingly, we may have less cash available to us to fund our operations.\nThe terms of our Purchase Agreement with Mesoblast for the sale of our ceMSC business provide for payment to us of $50 million in initial consideration, and up to an additional $50 million upon the achievement by Mesoblast of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. Additionally, we will be entitled to earn single to low double digit cash royalties on future sales by Mesoblast of Prochymal and other products utilizing the acquired ceMSC technology.\nWe have received all of the $50 million in initial consideration, consisting of $35 million in cash and $15 million in Mesoblast ordinary shares. Payment of the initial consideration made in Mesoblast\nordinary shares ($15 million) was subject to a one-year holding period that ended in December 2014. We continue to hold these shares and Mesoblast has agreed to purchase the shares for at least $15 million in cash prior to the middle of 2015. In the event that Mesoblast does not purchase these shares from us as agreed, the value of these shares will remain subject to market and foreign currency exchange risk, and we may be forced to liquidate these shares through other means and on terms materially less favorable to us. Our ability to receive the second $50 million is subject to satisfaction of a series of milestones, all of which are largely dependent upon the clinical and regulatory success of Mesoblast and other factors not in our control. These include many if not all of the risks and uncertainties that our ceMSC business was subject to prior to its sale to Mesoblast, including product development, efficacy and regulatory risks. We have received no such payments thus far, nor do we have any expectation of receiving any such payments in the foreseeable future. Our ability to earn royalty payments from Mesoblast is subject to these same risks and will require performance by Mesoblast that results in its meeting some or all of the milestones referred to above, and is thereafter also dependent upon the commercial success of Mesoblast's ceMSC business. Royalties, if any, are payable to us in cash. Any portion of the second $50 million that becomes payable to us will be payable, at the discretion of Mesoblast, in Mesoblast ordinary shares, based on a then current valuation of such shares.\nAny portion of the second $50 million in consideration paid in Mesoblast ordinary shares will also be, is subject to a one year holding period, again with limited downside protection for a drop in the Mesoblast share price over the holding period. Therefore, any such payment, if made, will be are subject to investment risk, and because the Mesoblast ordinary shares are traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and the per share price is denominated in Australian Dollars, will also be subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nAccordingly, not only do we have no assurances that any of the second $50.0 million in consideration will ever be paid to or received by us, but also we may be unable to liquidate on favorable terms any amounts paid to us in Mesoblast ordinary shares. As a result, we may have less cash available to fund our remaining operations and to support the continued development and pursuit of our Biosurgery business, and our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Purchase Agreement exposes us to contingent liabilities and other risks that could adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nIn the Purchase Agreement, we have made customary representations and warranties and the parties have agreed to indemnify each other for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement. Also pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we have retained a royalty free license to all transferred intellectual property, insofar as necessary for us to continue in our other businesses, including our Biosurgery business, and we have agreed not to compete with Mesoblast in the ceMSC business for a period of eight years. The Purchase Agreement also subjects us to other risks typical in business transactions of this type, including payment and performance risks. Should disputes arise or should we incur liability for breach of any of these representations, warranties or obligations, or should any of these other risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur long term business prospects will depend on the success of our Biosurgery business.\nAs a result of the sale of our ceMSC business, including Prochymal, our Biosurgery business is our sole remaining business, and our overall business is less diverse. Our long term business prospects will, therefore, be dependent almost entirely on the success of our Biosurgery business. This business involves significant risks and challenges in regards to product development and optimization,\nmanufacturing, government regulation, intellectual property, third-party reimbursement and market acceptance, among other risks previously disclosed by us.\nPayment of a portion of the purchase price for our Therapeutics business through the delivery of Mesoblast ordinary shares as permitted under the Purchase Agreement subjects us to significant additional risks.\nMesoblast ordinary shares delivered to us as payment under our Purchase Agreement with Mesoblast for the sale of our ceMSC business are subject to a one year holding period. Although we are afforded downside price protection for a drop over the holding period in the market price of Mesoblast ordinary shares delivered as payment, this downside protection is limited. To the extent the market price of the shares decreases over the holding period, Mesoblast has agreed to pay us for the decrease. This payment is to be made at least one half in cash and, at the option of Mesoblast, up to one half in additional shares of Mesoblast stock. Any additional Mesoblast stock will also have to be held for one year, for which period there will be no further downside price protection, and therefore the equity price risk will persist in respect of any additional Mesoblast shares issued to us. The Mesoblast ordinary shares are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the share value is denominated there in Australian Dollars. Hence, there also exists an associated foreign currency exchange rate risk. There is no corresponding mitigation of the foreign currency exchange rate risk, and any devaluation of the Australian Dollar will directly impact the value of the Mesoblast shares to us.\nOf the $50 million in initial consideration, $15 million has been paid to us in Mesoblast ordinary shares. Although we were initially subject to investment risk and foreign currency exchange risk in respect of our ownership of these shares, Mesoblast has agreed to purchase the shares for no less than $15 million during the first half of 2015.\nNevertheless, any portion of the second $50 million in consideration that may become payable to us under the Purchase Agreement (if and only if certain milestones are met by Mesoblast), is also payable to us, at the discretion of Mesoblast, in Mesoblast ordinary shares, based on a then current valuation of such shares. In the event of any negative events with respect to or otherwise affecting Mesoblast or the value of its ordinary shares, the value of any such additional Mesoblast ordinary shares acquired by us would be negatively affected and we could lose, in whole or in part, the value to us of that portion of the consideration paid to us by Mesoblast. If we are unable to liquidate on favorable terms any amounts paid to us in Mesoblast ordinary shares, we will have less cash available to fund our remaining operations and to support the continued development and pursuit of our biosurgery business, and our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAlthough we have recently remediated a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls, then a material misstatement could result in our financial statements.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and, as a result of such weakness, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2013. The material weakness related to the maintenance of effective controls over the application and monitoring of our accounting for income taxes. With respect to our controls over the application and monitoring of our accounting for income taxes, we did not have controls designed and in place to ensure effective oversight of the work performed, and the accuracy of, financial information or professional conclusions provided by, third-party tax advisors. We have since remediated the material weakness through implementation of enhanced controls related to review and oversight of complex transactions and infrequent events. Additionally, we engaged a new third party tax advisor to oversee and prepare the Company's tax\nprovision and other related documents. As a result, our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 no longer reports this material weakness or any other material weakness over financial reporting, and the audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm no longer expresses an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. Nevertheless, we may experience other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, which could lead to or result in a material misstatement in our financial statements.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock is highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022 results of clinical trials or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries, both generally or specific to us and our products;\n\u2022 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022 announcements by us of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts' reports or recommendations;\n\u2022 sales of substantial amounts of our stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022 sales of our stock by insiders and 5% stockholders;\n\u2022 general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 intellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us;\n\u2022 expiration or termination of our relationships with our collaborators; and\n\u2022 the other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies' stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law and of our charter and bylaws contain provisions that could delay and discourage takeover attempts and any attempts to replace our current management by stockholders.\nCertain provisions of Maryland General Corporation Law (MGCL) and of our Maryland charter and Maryland bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party\nfrom acquiring control of us or changing our Board of Directors and management. These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 classification of the board of directors with staggered terms of three years, which prevents a majority of the incumbent directors from being replaced at a single annual stockholders' meeting;\n\u2022 authorization of the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock generally without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 requirements that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by the chairman of the board of directors, upon request of stockholders holding at least 20% of the capital stock issued and outstanding, or upon a resolution adopted by, or an affirmative vote of, a majority of the board of directors; and\n\u2022 requirements that our stockholders comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to our Board of Directors or to place stockholders' proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of stockholders.\nMaryland law also prohibits \"business combinations\" between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in certain circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. Maryland law defines an interested stockholder as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's stock, or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's then-outstanding voting stock. A person is not an interested stockholder if the board of directors of the corporation approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, such approval may be conditional.\nAfter the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock, and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the voting stock other than stock held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or stock held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the holders of the common stock receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their stock in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its stock.\nThe statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of directors before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Our Board of Directors has not exempted us from the business combination statute. Consequently, unless the Board of Directors adopts an exemption from this statute in the future, the statute will be applicable and may affect business combinations between us and other persons. The statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us or increase the difficulty of consummating any such acquisition.\nOur bylaws also contain a provision exempting us from the \"control share acquisition\" provisions of the MGCL (Sections 3-701 through 3-709). We can provide no assurance that such provision of our bylaws will not be amended or eliminated in the future. Should this happen, the control share acquisition provisions would become effective and may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.\nSubtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL (\"Subtitle 8\") permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and with at least three independent directors to elect to be subject to any or all of five provisions:\n\u2022 a classified board;\n\u2022 a two-thirds vote requirement to remove a director;\n\u2022 a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by the vote of the directors;\n\u2022 a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred rather than until the next annual meeting of stockholders as would otherwise be the case; and\n\u2022 a majority requirement for the calling of a special meeting of stockholders.\nAn eligible Maryland corporation like us can elect into this statute by provision in its charter or bylaws or by a resolution of its board of directors, without stockholder approval. Furthermore, we can elect to be subject to the above provisions regardless of any contrary provisions in the charter or bylaws. Pursuant to Subtitle 8, we have elected to provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred. Through provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we have a classified board, and the number of our directors may be fixed only by the vote of the directors.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent others from influencing significant corporate decisions, and provisions in our charter allowing for a stockholder vote by consent in lieu of a meeting may make it easier for stockholders holding a majority of our common stock to take action.\nOur executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their affiliates, in aggregate, beneficially own approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock as of March 1, 2015. Included among this 54%, Peter Friedli, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and certain entities with which he is affiliated, beneficially own approximately 43% of our outstanding common stock as of March 1, 2015. These persons, acting together, will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nMoreover, as permitted by the MGCL, our charter provides that the holders of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may take action or consent to any action by delivering a consent in writing or by electronic transmission of the stockholders entitled to cast not less than the minimum number of votes (which is generally either a majority of votes cast or a majority of votes entitled to be cast) that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a stockholders meeting if the corporation gives notice of the action not later than ten (10) days after the effective date of the action to each holder of the class of common stock and to each stockholder who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting.\nAccordingly, these persons acting together, and Mr. Friedli specifically, currently has, and will continue to have, a significant influence over the outcome of all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including any actions that may be taken by stockholder consent in lieu of a meeting.", "PERMNO": 91434, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OSIR"}
