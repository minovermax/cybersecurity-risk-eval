Economic difficulties generally lead to tightening of credit and liquidity. These conditions often lead to low consumer confidence or changes in consumer spending, which in turn may result in delayed and reduced purchases of durable goods such as automobiles and other vehicles. As a result, during difficult economic times our OE customers can significantly reduce their production schedules. For example, light vehicle production declined significantly during the global pandemic in 2020. Also, persistent challenges in the Chinese economy beginning in 2018 and continuing into 2022 may result in declining light vehicle and commercial vehicle production. Additionally, production of off-highway equipment with our content on them have been weak in certain product applications, such as agricultural and construction equipment in North America and Europe. Any deterioration or prolonged difficulty in economic conditions in any region in which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and liquidity.\nIn addition, economic difficulties often lead to disruptions in the financial markets, which may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit which could materially and negatively affect our company. Future disruptions in the capital and credit markets, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates, could adversely affect our customers\u2019 and our ability to access the liquidity that is necessary to fund operations on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nAlso, financial or other difficulties at any of our major customers could have a material adverse impact on us, including as a result of lost revenues, significant write downs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges or additional restructuring beyond our current global plans. Severe financial or other difficulties at any of our major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain on a timely basis on similar economic terms the quantity and quality of components we require to produce our products.\nMoreover, severe financial or operating difficulties at any light vehicle or commercial vehicle manufacturer or other supplier could have a significant disruptive effect on the entire industry, leading to supply chain disruptions and labor unrest, among other things. These disruptions could force original equipment manufacturers and, in turn, other suppliers, including us, to shut down production at plants. While the issues that our customers and suppliers face during economic difficulties may be primarily financial in nature, other difficulties, such as an inability to meet increased demand as conditions recover, could also result in supply chain and other disruptions.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies, and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, reductions in revenue, and delays in payments from customers and partners, have led to an economic downturn in many of our markets. As a result of COVID-19, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions made to protect the health and safety of employees, consumers and communities, we and our customers have experienced significant closures and instances of reduced operations and limited access at corporate offices and other facilities which may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business. Also, economic conditions in the wake of the pandemic have included inflationary pressure, which could result in higher operating expenses and project costs for us, as well as higher interest rates.\nIn mid-2020, there was some loosening of government-mandated COVID-19 restrictions in certain locales in response to improved COVID-19 infection levels. However, upon worsening COVID-19 infection levels in certain localities in late 2020 and in early 2021, local governmental authorities in these localities have re-imposed either some or all of earlier restrictions or imposed other restrictions, all in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Also, in early 2021, vaccines for combating COVID-19 were approved by health agencies in certain countries/regions in which we operate (including the U.S., U.K., European Union, Canada, and Mexico) and began to be administered. The availability of COVID-19 vaccines and their take-up by individuals is difficult to predict and vaccination levels are likely to vary across jurisdictions. The sustainability of certain economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear as inflationary pressures have increased in the U.S. and globally and efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by new variants. In general, the pace and shape of the COVID-19 recovery as well as the impact and extent of COVID-19 variants or potential resurgences is not presently known.\nWhile certain measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 continued to be scaled back or done away with throughout 2021, we may face new or longer-term requirements and other operational restrictions due to, among other factors, future variants of COVID-19, vaccination rates and effectiveness, and evolving governmental restrictions. Although vaccines have proven to be effective in mitigating the risks of continued spread of COVID-19, there is no guarantee that the vaccines will continue to be effective against future variants. In particular, given recent resurgences in the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and effectiveness of global efforts to roll out vaccines and the impacts of COVID-19 variants around the world, we may have to re-institute earlier measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nThe uncertainties created by the COVID-19 global pandemic, including the severity, duration and possible resurgence of the outbreak, vaccination rates and impacts, and additional actions, including vaccination mandates, that may be or are being taken by governmental authorities make it difficult to forecast the effects of the virus on the Company\u2019s future results, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame. Additionally, it is possible that we may experience businesses being shut down, additional work restrictions and supply chain disruptions as well as labor shortages or increased labor costs as a result of COVID-19, further disrupting operations and impacting revenues negatively. We may also face unforeseen liabilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of claims alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connection with our facilities or operations or we may be subject to fines or penalties to the extent we fail to comply with applicable requirements. To the extent the COVID-19 global pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in our \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section, such as those relating to our level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness and to have access to sufficient liquidity through the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased revenue from loss of customer market share, and working capital requirements.\nIncreases in the costs and disruption in the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe principal raw material that we use is steel. We obtain steel from a number of sources pursuant to various contractual and other arrangements. Due to recent supply chain constraints within the automotive industry, we may encounter difficulty in obtaining steel and other commodities at current contractual prices and as a result may incur higher costs to procure these items. In addition, the automotive industry continues to face a shortage of semiconductors, which has led to production disruptions globally and created operating challenges for the automotive supplier base. In September 2021, IHS Markit lowered its 2022 global light vehicle production forecasts due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. In addition, we are experiencing other supply chain challenges, and the effects of inflation on commodities and our other costs to manufacture and distribute our products. Increases in the costs and disruption in the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFactors that reduce demand for our products or reduce prices could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for and pricing of our products are subject to economic conditions and other factors present in the various domestic and international markets where our products are sold. Demand for our OE products is subject to the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are equipped with our parts. The level of new light vehicle, commercial truck and off-highway vehicle purchases is cyclical, affected by such factors as general economic conditions, interest rates and availability of credit, consumer confidence, patterns of consumer spending, industrial construction levels, fuel costs, government incentives, and vehicle replacement cycles. Consumer preferences and government regulations also impact the demand for new light vehicle purchases equipped with our products. For example, if consumers increasingly prefer electric vehicles, demand for the vehicles equipped with our clean air and powertrain products could decrease.\nDemand for our aftermarket, or replacement, products varies based upon such factors as general economic conditions; the level of new vehicle purchases, which initially displaces demand for aftermarket products; the severity of winter weather, which increases the demand for certain aftermarket products; the number of vehicles in operation; and other factors, including the average useful life of parts and number of miles driven.\nThe highly cyclical nature of the automotive and commercial vehicle industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Decreases in demand for automobiles and commercial vehicles and vehicle parts generally, or in the demand for our products in particular, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we believe that increasingly stringent environmental standards for emissions have presented and will continue to present an important opportunity for us to grow our clean air product line. We cannot assure you, however, that environmental standards for emissions will continue to become more stringent or that the adoption of any new standards will not be delayed beyond our expectations.\nWe may be unable to realize sales represented by our awarded business, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe realization of future sales from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our OE customers will actually produce, the timing of that production and the mix of options that our OE customers and consumers may choose. For example, light vehicle production declined significantly during the global pandemic in 2020. Also, persistent challenges in the Chinese economy in 2018 and going into 2022 may result in declining light and commercial vehicle production in the region. Additionally, we have experienced significant volatility in customer demand throughout 2021 and into 2022, creating risk that the forecasted volumes of sales will not be realized and, in many cases, increasing the costs and challenges inherent in managing our supply chain. In addition to the risks inherent in the cyclicality of vehicle production, our customers generally have the right to replace us with another supplier at any time for a variety of reasons and have demanded price decreases over the life of awarded business. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will in fact realize any or all of the future sales represented by our awarded business. Any failure to realize these sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded OE business well in advance of the customer\u2019s production start date. In certain instances, the terms of our OE customer arrangements permit us to recover these pre-production costs if the customer cancels the business through no fault of our company. Although we have been successful in recovering these costs under appropriate circumstances in the past, we can give no assurance that our results of operations will not be materially impacted in the future if we are unable to recover these types of pre-production costs in the event of an OE customer\u2019s cancellation of awarded business.\nOur level of debt makes us more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns; and provisions in our debt agreements could constrain our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOur level of debt makes us more vulnerable to changes in our results of operations because a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to servicing our debt and is not available for other purposes and our level of debt could impair our ability to raise additional capital if necessary. Further increases in interest rates will increase the amount of cash required for debt service. Under the terms of our senior secured credit facility, the indentures governing our notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness, we are limited in the amount of and type of additional indebtedness we can incur in the future. The more we become leveraged, the more we, and in turn our security holders, become exposed to many of the risks described herein.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service, capital investment and working capital requirements, we may need to seek additional financing or sell assets. If we require such financing and are unable to obtain it, we could be forced to sell assets under unfavorable circumstances and we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations.\nIn addition, our senior credit facility and our other debt agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry, including limitations on our ability to:\n\u2022declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or purchase other debt;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022make loans, guarantees, acquisitions and investments;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022engage in mergers, acquisitions or asset sales; and\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur senior credit facility and other agreements governing financings we enter into from time to time require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our senior credit facility and our other financing instruments require us to comply with various operational and other covenants. If there were an event of default under any of our financing instruments that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted financing could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that financing to be due and payable immediately (which, in turn, could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other financing arrangements). If such event occurs, the lenders under our senior credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could lose access to our factoring and supply chain financing programs. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding financing instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated, upon an event of default, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those financing instruments. This would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations, and on our ability to affect our share repurchase and dividend programs. For example, in 2020 we amended our senior credit agreement to relax the financial ratios we are required to maintain to facilitate operational flexibility in light of our outlook for the second half of 2020. Even though we were able to obtain amendments in 2020, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain amendments on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, if required in the future.\nOur working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers\u2019 worldwide vehicle production and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash flows from operations, we would look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our borrowing arrangements to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.\nWe may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our initiatives to improve operating performance and generate cost savings and improvements.\nWe regularly implement strategic and other initiatives designed to improve our operating performance. Our inability to implement these initiatives in accordance with our plans or our failure to achieve the goals of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on these initiatives to offset pricing pressures from our suppliers and our customers, as described above, as well as to manage the impacts of production cuts. Our implementation of announced initiatives is from time to time subject to legal challenge in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions (where applicable employment laws differ from those in the U.S.). Furthermore, the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our notes may restrict the types of initiatives we undertake. In the past we have been successful in obtaining the consent of our senior lenders where appropriate in connection with our initiatives. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to pursue, successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any initiative or that we will be able to sustain improvements made to date.\nExchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to increased risk because we generate a significant portion of our net sales and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For example, where we have a greater portion of costs than revenues generated in a foreign currency, we are subject to risk if the foreign currency in which our costs are paid appreciates against the currency in which we generate revenue because the appreciation effectively increases our cost in that country.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of some of our operating entities are reported in foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported revenues and operating profit while depreciation of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and operating profit.\nWe do not generally seek to mitigate the impacts of currency through the use of derivative financial instruments. To the extent we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in that currency could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time we experience significant increases and fluctuations in the pricing of raw materials and the cost of logistics connected to producing and receiving such materials, the cost of utilities required to produce our products and increases in certain lead times; and future changes in the prices of raw materials, logistics, or utility services, or future increases in lead times, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nSignificant increases in the cost of certain raw materials used in our products, including, among other materials, steel, oil and rubber, or the cost of utility services required to produce these products to the extent they are not timely reflected in the price we charge our customers or are otherwise mitigated could materially and adversely impact our results. During 2021, compared to 2020, market prices increased for key inputs such as carbon steel in North America, copper and aluminum, along with increases in logistics costs connected to producing and receiving such materials.\nWe attempt to mitigate these increases by evaluating alternative materials and processes, reviewing material substitution opportunities, increasing component sourcing and parts assembly in best cost countries, and strategically pursuing regional and global purchasing strategies for specific commodities. We also negotiate to recover these higher costs from our customers, and in some cases, such as with respect to steel surcharges, we have the contractual right to recover some or all of these higher costs from certain of our customers. However, if we are successful in recovering these higher costs, we may not receive that recovery in the same period that the costs were incurred and the benefit of the recovery may not be evenly distributed throughout the year.\nWe also continue to pursue productivity initiatives and other opportunities to reduce costs through restructuring activities. During periods of economic recovery, the cost of raw materials, logistics and utility services generally rise. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that we will not face further increased prices in the future or, if we do, whether our actions will be effective in containing them.\nBy entering into new product lines and employing new technologies, our ability to produce certain of these products may be constrained due to longer lead times for our facilities, as well as those of our suppliers. We attempt to mitigate the negative effects of these longer lead times by improving the accuracy of our long-term planning; however, we cannot provide any certainty that we will be successful in avoiding disruptions to our delivery schedules.\nOur aftermarket sales may be negatively impacted by increasing competition from lower cost, private-label products.\nDistribution channels in the aftermarket have continued to consolidate and, as a result, our sales to large retail customers represent a significant portion of our aftermarket business. Private-label aftermarket products, which are typically manufactured at a lower cost, often containing little or no premium technology, and are branded with a store or other private-label brand, are increasingly available to these large retail customers. Our aftermarket business is facing increasing competition from these lower cost, private-label products and there is growing pressure to expand our entry-level product lines so that retailers may offer a greater range of price points to their consumer customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our aftermarket sales to these large retail customers or that increased competition from these lower cost, private-label aftermarket products will not have an adverse impact on our aftermarket business.\nIf the reputation of one or more of our leading brands is harmed, aftermarket sales may be negatively impacted.\nOur aftermarket sales are dependent on the reputation and success of our brands, including Monroe\u00ae, Champion\u00ae, \u00d6hlins\u00ae, MOOG\u00ae, Walker\u00ae, Fel-Pro\u00ae, Wagner\u00ae, Ferodo\u00ae, Rancho\u00ae, Thrush\u00ae, National\u00ae, Sealed Power\u00ae and others. Product liability claims or recalls could result in negative publicity that could harm the reputation of our brands. If one or more of our leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nImprovements in automotive parts are adversely affecting aftermarket demand for some of our products.\nThe average useful life of automotive parts has steadily increased in recent years due to innovations in products and technologies. The longer product lives allow vehicle owners to replace parts of their vehicles less often. As a result, a portion of sales in the aftermarket has been displaced. In addition, advancements in technology may lead to enhancements in aftermarket product performance that render our product obsolete. This has adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our aftermarket sales. Also, any additional increases in the average useful lives of automotive parts or other enhancements in aftermarket performance would further adversely affect the demand for our aftermarket products.\nNatural disasters, local and global public health emergencies, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may affect our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend and could impact our business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf any of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tornados, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons), public health crises (such as pandemics and epidemics), political crises (such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict), or other events outside of our control, our business and our results of operations and financial condition could suffer. Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending or the economy in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, which have unique risks.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures. Our joint ventures are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our partners, and, as such, we do not unilaterally control the joint ventures. There is a risk that our partners\u2019 objectives for the joint ventures may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements over management of the joint ventures. At some of our joint ventures, our joint venture partner is also affiliated with the largest customer of the joint venture, which may create a conflict between the interests of our partner and the joint venture. Also, our ability to sell our interest in a joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations.\nAdditional risks associated with joint ventures include our partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners, a change in the ownership of any of our partners and our limited ability to control compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks related to operating a multi-national company.\nWe have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many regions across six continents. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, a significant portion of our net sales were derived from operations outside North America. Current events including the possibility of renegotiated trade deals and international tax law treaties, create a level of uncertainty, and potentially increased complexity, for multi-national companies. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, international operations are subject to various risks which could have a material adverse effect on those operations or our business as a whole, including:\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations, including those in countries with hyperinflationary economies;\n\u2022exposure to local economic conditions and labor issues;\n\u2022exposure to local political conditions, including the risk of seizure of assets by a foreign government;\n\u2022exposure to local social conditions, including corruption and any acts of war, terrorism or similar events;\n\u2022exposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;\n\u2022inflation in certain countries;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation of cash, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022retaliatory tariffs and restrictions limiting free movement of goods and an unfavorable trade environment, including as a result of political conditions and changes in the laws in the U.S. and elsewhere and as described in more details below; and\n\u2022requirements for manufacturers to use locally produced goods.\nEntering new markets poses new competitive threats and commercial risks.\nAs we have expanded into markets beyond light vehicles, we expect to diversify our product sales by leveraging technologies being developed for the light vehicle segment. Such diversification requires investments and resources which may not be available as needed. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in leveraging our capabilities into new markets and thus, in meeting the needs of these new customers and competing favorably in these new markets. Further, a significant portion of our growth potential is dependent on our ability to increase sales to commercial truck and off-highway vehicle customers. While we believe that we can achieve our growth targets with the production contracts that have been or will be awarded to us, our future prospects will be negatively affected if those customers underlying these contracts experience reduced demand for their products, or financial difficulties.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, which may become impaired in the future and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of long-lived assets, goodwill, and other identifiable intangibles assets, including customer relationships, trademarks and brand names, and developed technologies due to the Federal-Mogul LLC acquisition. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, are required to be evaluated for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. If business conditions or other factors cause profitability and cash flows to decline, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events indicate it is warranted. Impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products sold by our business, and a variety of other factors. The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in the event that long lived assets, goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets become impaired.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryovers and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss and other tax carryforwards.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. A corporation generally experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d if the percentage of its shares of stock owned by its \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our tax attributes is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nOur expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors.\nOur overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our total profit or loss before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are determined separately for each tax paying entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each jurisdiction. Losses in certain jurisdictions may provide no current financial statement tax benefit. As a result, changes in the mix of profits and losses between jurisdictions, among other factors, could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate.\nThe Company\u2019s hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs.\nIn order to mitigate short-term variation in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations, the Company hedged a portion of near-term exposure to certain raw materials used in production processes, primarily copper, nickel, tin, zinc, high-grade aluminum and aluminum alloy. The results of this hedging practice could be positive, neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures.\nOur hedging activities are not designed to mitigate long-term commodity price fluctuations and, therefore, will not protect from long-term commodity price increases. Our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw materials costs, which would accelerate the recognition in our operating results of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions.\nIf we cannot attract, retain, and motivate employees, we may be unable to compete effectively, and lose the ability to improve and expand our businesses, and increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers, as well as labor shortages, could adversely affect our business.\nOur success and ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and expand our business in many locations around the world. We face intense competition for highly qualified, specialized technical, managerial and other personnel. Recruiting, training, retention, and benefit costs place significant demands on our resources. The inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of key management employees or a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us.\nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortages to date, we have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. The increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees could result in higher compensation costs and difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. A sustained labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor cost inflation, caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, which could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business and have other adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders, including potential proxy contests.\nWe value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our stockholders regarding strategy and performance. The Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There can be no assurance, however, that the actions taken by the Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful, and we may be subject to formal or informal actions or requests from stockholders or others. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention and resources of management and employees, and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flow and the market price of our common stock.\nUncertainties related to, or the results of, any actions by activist stockholders could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given as to the outcome or timing of any matters relating to actions by activist stockholders or the ultimate impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s pension obligations and other postretirement benefits could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating margins and cash flows.\nThe automotive industry, like other industries, continues to be affected by the rising cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits. In addition, the Company sponsors certain defined benefit plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments. If the performance of the assets in the pension plans does not meet the Company\u2019s expectations, or other actuarial assumptions are updated, the Company\u2019s required contributions may be higher than it expects.\nIndustry Risks\nWe are dependent on certain large customers for future revenue. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our revenues from any of these customers or the loss of market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe depend on major vehicle manufacturers for a substantial portion of our revenues. For example, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, General Motors and Ford accounted for 11% and 10% of our net sales. Following the Federal-Mogul LLC acquisition, we are increasingly dependent on certain major aftermarket customers for our revenues. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our revenues from any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations by reducing cash flows and our ability to spread costs over a larger revenue base. Circumstances that could result in a loss of revenues from our large-volume customers include, without limitation, the transition away from the production of gasoline powered vehicles (such as the announcements made by General Motors and Ford in 2021) and the transition to electrified powertrains, whether voluntary or mandated. We may experience decreased revenues from these customers for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: (i) in the case of our OE customers, loss of awarded platforms, reduced demand for our customers\u2019 products, and work stoppages or other disruptions impacting OE production, and (ii) in the case of our aftermarket customers, reduced or delayed consumer requirements and competition from other brands or lower-cost alternatives. Further, our aftermarket customers are generally able to change suppliers more quickly than OE customers, which heightens these risks with respect to our aftermarket business.\nFor all of our customers, we face additional risks including (i) national and local mandates to phase-out or limit the use or sale of gasoline or diesel powered vehicles; and (ii) our customers failure to pay us for a variety of other reasons, including their respective financial conditions.\nIn addition, our customers compete intensively against each other. The loss of market share by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business unless we are able to achieve increased sales to other major customers.\nThe hourly workforce in the industry in which we participate is highly unionized and our business could be adversely affected by labor disruptions in the U.S. or internationally.\nA portion of our hourly workforce in North America and the majority of our hourly workforce in other regions are unionized. Although we consider our current relations with our employees to be satisfactory, if major work disruptions were to occur, our business could be adversely affected by, for instance, a loss of revenues, increased costs or reduced profitability. We have not experienced a material labor disruption in our recent history, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material labor disruption at one of our facilities in the future in the course of renegotiation of our labor arrangements or otherwise.\nIn addition to the risk of a work stoppage at one of our facilities, labor disruptions at other domestic or international companies may have an adverse effect on us. In the U.S., substantially all of the hourly employees of General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis in North America and many of their other suppliers are represented by The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\u201cUAW\u201d) under collective bargaining agreements. Internationally, certain vehicle manufacturers, their suppliers and their respective employees are also subject to labor agreements. In September 2019, General Motors hourly workers represented by the UAW went on strike, which affected the volumes at certain of our North American plants in the third quarter of 2019. Although the strike was resolved on October 25, 2019, the strike affected volumes in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well. A work stoppage or strike at one of our production facilities, at those of a customer, or impacting a supplier of ours or any of our customers, either domestically or internationally, could have an adverse impact on us by disrupting demand for our products or our ability to manufacture our products.\nWe may have difficulty competing favorably in the highly competitive light vehicle and commercial vehicle supplier industry.\nThe light vehicle and commercial vehicle supplier automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Although the overall number of competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas, including from new competitors entering the markets which we serve. The principal competitive factors include price, quality, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation, global presence and timely delivery. As a result, many suppliers have established or are establishing themselves in emerging, low-cost markets to reduce their costs of production and be more conveniently located for customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete favorably in this competitive market or that increased competition will not have a material adverse impact on our business by reducing our ability to increase or maintain sales or profit margins.\nIn addition, our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to ours, adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do, particularly in respect of potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions. As a result, our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products. These trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products. Failure to innovate and to develop or acquire products that capitalize on new technologies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFurthermore, due to the cost focus of our major OE customers, we have been, and expect to continue to be, requested to reduce prices as part of our initial business quotations and over the life of OE vehicle platforms we have been awarded. We cannot be certain that we will be able to generate cost savings and operational improvements in the future that are sufficient to offset price reductions requested by existing OE customers and necessary to win additional business. OE customers also direct us to engage specific suppliers for component purchases not allowing us to leverage our own supply base and realize cost reductions on this directed spend.\nThe decreasing number of customers and suppliers in our industry could make it more difficult for us to compete favorably.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected because the customer base for our parts and services is decreasing in both the OE market and aftermarket. As a result, we are competing for business from fewer customers. Furthermore, consolidation among suppliers have resulted in fewer, larger suppliers who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. If we cannot achieve cost savings and operational improvements sufficient to allow us to compete favorably in the future with these larger companies, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not respond appropriately, the evolution towards connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility and electrification could adversely affect our business.\nThe light vehicle industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially viable, fully autonomous vehicle. Continued focus on climate change and environmental sustainability is increasing the expectations for the auto industry to develop more fuel-efficient solutions from consumers and governments worldwide. For example, General Motors joined other vehicle manufacturers in 2021, including Ford, Nissan and Volvo, in committing to becoming carbon neutral after announcing its plans to reach carbon neutrality by 2040 and to stop selling gasoline powered light vehicles by 2035. To achieve these goals, General Motors is investing substantially in electrification. The increased adoption of electrified powertrains could result in lower demand for some of our products. There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for car and ride sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. The evolution of the industry towards connectivity, autonomy, shared mobility and electrification has also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional light vehicle industry. Failure to innovate and to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to OE and consumer preferences could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nLegal, Regulatory and Policy Risks\nWe are subject to, and could be further subject to, government investigations or actions by other third parties.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that govern our business both in the U.S. and internationally, including antitrust laws, violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions. Responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nWe cannot assure you that the reserve we have established to resolve these matters will not change materially from time to time or that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may incur costs related to product warranties, environmental and regulatory matters, legal proceedings and other claims, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we receive product warranty claims from our customers, pursuant to which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Vehicle manufacturers require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and to be responsible for the operation of these component products in new vehicles sold to consumers. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We cannot assure you that costs associated with providing product warranties will not be material, or that those costs will not exceed any amounts reserved in our consolidated financial statements. For a description of our accounting policies regarding warranty reserves, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d.\nOur global operations subject us to extensive governmental regulations worldwide. Foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations may change from time to time and our compliance with new or amended laws and regulations in the future may materially increase our costs and could adversely affect our results of operations and competitive position. For example, we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. Soil and groundwater remediation activities are being conducted at certain of our current and former real properties. We record liabilities for these activities when environmental assessments indicate that the remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. On this basis, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for the remediation activities at our current and former real properties for which we could be held responsible. Although we believe our estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information, the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to change as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required. In future periods, we could incur cash costs or charges to earnings if we are required to undertake remediation efforts as the result of ongoing analysis of the environmental status of our properties. In addition, violations of the laws and regulations we are subject to could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, as well as prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe also from time to time are involved in a variety of legal proceedings, claims or investigations. These matters typically are incidental to the conduct of our business. Some of these matters involve allegations of damages against us relating to environmental liabilities, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, taxes, employment matters or commercial or contractual disputes or allegations relating to legal compliance by us or our employees. For example, we are subject to a number of lawsuits initiated by a significant number of claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos. Many of these cases involve significant numbers of individual claimants. Many of these cases also involve numerous\ndefendants. As major asbestos manufacturers or other companies that used asbestos in their manufacturing processes continue to go out of business, we may experience an increased number of these claims.\nWe cannot assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental and Legal Contingencies\u201d.\nChanges in tax law or trade agreements and new or changed tariffs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in political, regulatory and economic conditions and/or changes in laws and policies governing tax laws, foreign trade (including trade agreements and tariffs), manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we and/or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and business.\nFor example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law new legislation that significantly revised the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, a one-time transition tax on offshore earnings at reduced tax rates regardless of whether the earnings are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign dividends (subject to certain important exceptions), new taxes on certain foreign earnings, a new minimum tax related to payments to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments as opposed to deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits.\nIn addition, the U.S., Mexico and Canada have renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). The revised agreement, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), contains new and revised provisions that alter the prior rules governing when imports and exports of autos and auto parts are eligible for duty-free treatment. Generally, these new rules require a higher percentage of the overall content of the auto or autopart to originate in one of the USMCA\u2019s countries (the U.S., Mexico or Canada). The USMCA was effective July 1, 2020. Our manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are dependent on duty-free trade within the USMCA region. We have significant movement of goods within NAFTA region, and the imposition of customs duties on imports could negatively impact our financial performance.\nMoreover, in March 2018, the U.S. government imposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on certain steel imports and a 10% ad valorem tariff on certain aluminum imports. These tariffs (known as \u201cSection 232 tariffs\u201d) apply to certain steel and aluminum imports from almost all countries. In addition, over the course of 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government imposed additional tariffs on products from China valued at $550 billion, with some limited exceptions (known as \u201cSection 301 tariffs\u201d). As a result of the tariffs, China and other countries have implemented retaliatory actions with respect to U.S. imports into their countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur By-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders and designate the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forum for actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nThe By-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) as the exclusive jurisdiction for (a) any derivative proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any proceeding asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the Company to the Company or its stockholders, (c) any proceeding pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or (d) any proceeding asserting a claim against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, the By-laws provide that the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for any complaint raising a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our By-laws described above. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our By-laws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nDevelopments relating to our intellectual property could materially impact our business.\nWe and others in our industry hold a number of patents and other intellectual property rights, including licenses, which are critical to our respective businesses and competitive positions. Notwithstanding our intellectual property portfolio, our competitors may develop similar or superior proprietary technologies. Further, as we expand into regions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others replicating our proprietary technologies increases, which could result in a deterioration of our competitive position. On occasion, we may assert claims against third parties who are taking actions that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights. These claims, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to prosecute, defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of our management and employees. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any such claim were to result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to take actions which may include: expending significant resources to develop or license non-infringing products; paying substantial damages to third parties, including to customers to compensate them for their discontinued use or replacing infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or cessation of the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or our competitive position.\nWe may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in technology and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products.\nChanges in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues.\nWe cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development or production, and failure of products to operate properly. If we are unable to react to changes in the marketplace, including the potential introduction of technologies such as autonomous vehicles, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nInformation Technology Risks\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions or security breaches, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operations rely on a number of information technologies to manage, store, and support business activities. Some of these technologies are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. We have put in place a number of systems, processes, and practices designed to protect against the failure of our systems, as well as the misappropriation, exposure or corruption of the information stored thereon. Unintentional service disruptions or intentional actions such as intellectual property theft, cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, unauthorized access or malicious software, may lead to such misappropriation, exposure or corruption if our, or our service providers\u2019, protective measures prove to be inadequate. In addition, the costs to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, ransomware, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, resulting potentially in the theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information that we store electronically. Further, these events may cause operational impediments or otherwise adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and/or results of operations. We could also encounter violations of applicable law, contracts or reputational damage from the disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers or suppliers. In addition, the disclosure of non-public information could lead to the loss of our intellectual property and/or diminished competitive advantages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. In addition, evolving and expanding compliance and operational requirements under the privacy laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time or potential fines for non-compliance.\nRisk Factors related to the Proposed Merger\nThe proposed Merger is subject to approval of our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions, including government consents and approvals, some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed within the expected timeframe, if at all.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including obtaining the approval of our stockholders, the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act, and the receipt of other required regulatory approvals, consents or clearances with respect to the Merger under applicable competition and/or foreign direct investment laws. We can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, even if all required consents and approvals can be obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any adverse consequence of the pending Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nEach party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to customary materiality qualifications) and compliance in all material respects with the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger, including, with respect to us, covenants to conduct our business in the ordinary course and to not engage in certain kinds of material transactions prior to closing. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, in connection with a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors to enter into an agreement for a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). As a result, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be completed, even if our stockholders approve the Merger, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.\nWe may not complete the proposed Merger within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and/or operations.\nThe proposed Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, as a result of various factors and conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange and registered under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and we will be required to continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Moreover, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected, and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the shares would return to the prices at which the shares currently trade;\n\u2022we may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees, customers, partners, suppliers and others with whom we do business;\n\u2022we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, printing and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022we may be required to pay a cash termination fee to Parent, as required under the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;\n\u2022while the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain kinds of material transactions, which could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may as a result materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could result in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and\n\u2022we may commit significant time and resources to defending against litigation related to the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, the risks described above may materialize, and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial results and stock price, particularly to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nWe will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers and other third-party business partners.\nOur efforts to complete the Merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the Merger is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger. As mentioned above, a substantial amount of our management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention is being directed toward the completion of the Merger and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with customers and potential customers. For example, customers, suppliers and other third parties may defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nIn certain instances, the Merger Agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Parent, which could affect the decisions of a third party considering making an alternative acquisition proposal.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee under specified conditions, including in the event Parent terminates the Merger Agreement before receipt of our stockholders\u2019 approval due to a change in recommendation by our Board of Directors, in the event we terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior Proposal, or in the event we enter into an alternative transaction within twelve months of termination of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances and the alternative transaction is consummated. This payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us and could discourage a third party from making a competing acquisition proposal, including a proposal that would be more favorable to our stockholders than the Merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including regulatory costs, fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger.\nLitigation challenging the Merger Agreement may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected timeframe or at all.\nLawsuits may be filed against us, our Board of Directors or other parties to the Merger Agreement, challenging our acquisition by Parent making other claims in connection therewith. Such lawsuits may be brought by our purported stockholders and may seek, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the Merger. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that the consummation of the Merger is not restrained, made illegal, enjoined or prohibited by any order or legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition of a court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental entity. As such, if the plaintiffs in such potential lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective, or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.", "PERMNO": 84375, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "TEN"}
