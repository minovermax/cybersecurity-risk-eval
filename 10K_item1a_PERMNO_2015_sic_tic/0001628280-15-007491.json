{"cik": "1320947", "company": "Diamond Foods Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-10-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to many risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRaw materials that are necessary in the production and packaging of our products are subject to fluctuations in availability, quality and price that could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe availability, size, quality and cost of raw materials used in the production and packaging of our products, including nuts, potatoes, corn and corn products, cooking and vegetable oils, corrugate, resins and other commodities, are subject to price volatility and supply fluctuations caused by changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (whether caused by climate change or otherwise), natural disasters, crop disease, pests, government agricultural and energy programs, foreign currency exchange rates and consumer demand. In particular, the availability and cost of walnuts and other nuts are subject to supply contract renewals, crop size, quality, yield fluctuations, and changes in governmental regulation as well as other factors. Additionally, we rely on raw materials that come from regions that suffer from severe water scarcity or yearly fluctuations in water availability, such as California where severe drought conditions are at historical levels, and fluctuations in the availability of water may reduce the availability of raw materials not only in a particular season but also over time.\nWe source walnuts primarily from California growers with whom we have entered into walnut purchase agreements. To the extent contracted growers deliver less supply than we expected or we are unable to renew enough walnut purchase agreements or enter into such agreements with new growers in any particular year, we may not have sufficient walnut supply under contract to satisfy our business requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our sales and our results of operations. To obtain sufficient walnut supply, which represents a significant portion of our cost of goods sold, we may be required to purchase walnuts from third parties at substantially higher prices or forgo sales to some market segments, which would reduce our profitability. If we forgo sales to such market segments, we may lose customers and may not be able to replace them later. Given our fixed costs from our manufacturing facilities, if we have a lower supply of walnuts or other raw materials, our unit costs will increase and our gross margin will decline. To the extent contracted growers deliver greater supply than we expect or significantly greater supply than in prior years, we may need to find new outlets or channels to sell such walnuts, which may adversely impact our margins. If and to the extent we are unsuccessful in selling such additional supply, our cash flows and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe make estimates of the price we will pay for walnuts to growers under contract starting in the first quarter of our fiscal year and, pursuant to our walnut purchase agreements, we finalize the price to be paid to growers by the end of the fiscal year. The price customers pay for walnuts fluctuates throughout the year depending on market forces. To the extent that we enter into contracts with our customers based on walnut cost estimates that ultimately prove to be below the final price we determine to pay to growers, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Additionally, to the extent that the price we pay growers ultimately proves to be higher than the market value of walnuts, we may be unable to compete effectively, have to sell our walnuts below cost or at lower margins than we desire, and need to impair the inventory value of our walnuts, so our business and results of operations could be harmed. Each year some of our walnut supply agreements are up for renewal, and competition among walnut handlers makes renewal with us uncertain. Disruption in our walnut supply and inability to secure walnuts cost effectively may adversely impact our business and our financial results.\nOur potato chip products are dependent on suppliers providing us with an adequate supply of quality potatoes on a timely basis. The failure of our suppliers to meet our specifications, quality standards or delivery schedules could have an adverse effect on our potato chip operations. In particular, a sudden scarcity, substantial price increase, quality issue or unavailability of ingredients could adversely affect our operating results. There can be no assurance that alternative ingredients would be available when needed on commercially attractive terms, if at all. In addition, high commodity prices could lead to unexpected costs and price increases of our products that might dampen growth of consumer demand for our products. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, this could substantially harm our business and results of operations\nIf we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our sales and profitability would be negatively affected.\nOur markets are highly competitive and competition is generally based on product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty. As a result, on an ongoing basis in the markets in which we operate, we face pricing pressure as well as new products, marketing efforts and brand campaigns by competitors , each of which create challenges in establishing and maintaining profit margins. Our products compete against food and snack products sold by many regional and national companies, some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than we have. The greater scale and resources that may be available to our competitors could provide them with the ability to lower prices or increase their promotional or marketing spending to compete more effectively. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms. We may need to reduce our prices or increase promotional incentives in response to competition or to grow, maintain or stabilize our market share or sales. If we decide to reduce or eliminate promotional incentives to improve our profitability, we may not be able to compete effectively and we may lose distribution and market\nshare, which could also lead to a decline in revenue. Additionally, losing sales or failing to forecast sales accurately could result in increased inventories, which would adversely impact our liquidity.\nCompetition and customer pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity or other cost increases or may force us to decrease prices, in the event of commodity or other cost decreases or otherwise. We may also need to increase spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation to stabilize, maintain or increase our market share or sales. Our marketing activities and contracts may commit us to expenses that may not provide the return on investment we expect, adversely affect our ability to establish other marketing programs, limit our ability to cut expenses or result in contractual or other disputes, any of which may adversely affect our business. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could be unable to increase the breadth of the distribution of our products or lose customers or distribution of products, which could have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability. In addition, if we are required to maintain high levels of promotional incentives or trade terms with respect to particular product lines, our margins and profitability would be adversely effected.\nIf the parties we depend upon for raw material supplies do not perform adequately, our ability to manufacture our products may be impaired, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the raw materials we use to manufacture our products, and our ability to manufacture our products depends on receiving adequate supplies on a timely basis. If we do not maintain good relationships with important suppliers or are unable to identify a replacement supplier or develop our own sourcing capabilities (at a reasonable cost or at all), our ability to manufacture our products may be harmed, which would result in interruptions in our business and harm our business and results of operations. In addition, even if we are able to find replacement suppliers when needed, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on favorable terms and conditions, which could increase our costs of production. The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations, including foreign currency risks.\nWe conduct a substantial amount of business with vendors and customers located outside the United States. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound and Canadian dollar. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars and we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S dollars for external reporting purposes. Many factors relating to our international sales and operations, many of which factors are outside of our control, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013, sales outside the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and Netherlands, accounted for approximately 25%, 25% and 24% of our net sales, respectively.\nIn addition to the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, there are risks specifically related to our international sales and operations that could adversely impact our business and results of operations. These include:\n\u2022\nforeign exchange rates, foreign currency exchange and transfer restrictions, which may unpredictably and adversely impact our consolidated operating results, our asset and liability balances and our cash flow in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency;\n\u2022\nnegative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments, including the threat of war, terrorist attacks, epidemic or civil unrest;\n\u2022\npandemics, such as the flu, which may adversely affect our workforce as well as our local suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nearthquakes, tsunamis, floods or other major disasters that may limit the supply of nuts or other products that we purchase abroad;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers, including tariffs, quotas, and import or export licensing requirements imposed by governments;\n\u2022\nincreased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor standards;\n\u2022\ndiffering levels of protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with complying with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to entities with overseas operations;\n\u2022\nthe threat that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022\nvarying regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative practices in the jurisdictions where we operate;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with operating under a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations; and\n\u2022\npotentially burdensome taxation.\nAny of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to conduct product recalls, potentially triggering concerns with the safety and quality of our products, which could cause consumers to avoid our products and reduce our sales and net income.\nThe sale of food products for human consumption involves risk of injury to consumers. We face risks associated with product recalls and liability claims if our products become adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, or cause injury, illness, or death. Our products may be subject to product tampering and to contamination and spoilage risks, such as mold, bacteria, insects and other pests, shell fragments, cross-contamination and off-flavor contamination. If any of our products were to be tampered with, or otherwise tainted and we were unable to detect it prior to shipment, our products could be subject to a recall. Recalls might also be required due to usage of raw materials provided by third-party ingredient suppliers. Such suppliers are required to supply material free of contamination, but may, on occasion, identify issues after selling material to Diamond manufacturing locations. Our ability to sell products could be reduced if governmental agencies conclude that our products have been tampered with, or that certain pesticides, herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents. A significant product recall could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time and reduce our sales. Adverse publicity could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products, damage to our reputation and reduce our sales for an extended period. Product recalls and product liability claims could increase our expenses and have an adverse effect on demand for our products and, consequently, reduce our sales, net income and liquidity.\nMaterial weaknesses can exist in our system of internal control over financial reporting, which could have a material impact on our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process. We expect that we will need to improve existing operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and implement new ones, to manage our future business effectively. Any implementation delays, or disruption in the transition to new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to forecast sales, manage our supply chain, and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. If we are unable to record and report financial information on a timely and accurate basis, we may have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting adequate to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. From time to time in the past, we have experienced control weaknesses that were material weaknesses, including a material weakness relating to our evaluation and review of complex and non-routine transactions and a material weakness related to our controls over journal entries.\nAny future material weakness in our system of internal control over financial reporting may make it difficult for us to manage our business, harm our results of operations, impair our ability to report results accurately and on time, cause investors to lose faith in the reliability of our statements, and materially adversely impact the price of our securities.\nWe do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As a result, we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. A material weakness means a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting exists such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could make it difficult for us to manage our business, result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Any such failure could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting, cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause investors to lose faith in the reliability of our statements or cause the market price of our common stock and/or our notes to decline.\nPending and future litigation may lead us to incur significant costs and could adversely affect our business.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to the marketing and labeling of products, intellectual property, contracts, product recalls, product liability, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. For example, in 2014, we were sued by various parties alleging that certain ingredients contained in our Kettle Brand chips and TIAS Tortilla Chips are not natural, Even when not merited, the defense of lawsuits and claims may divert our management\u2019s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and claims.\nAdditionally, as set forth in \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d on September 23, 2013, a Notice of Appeal from the order granting final approval of our settlement of In re Diamond Foods, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation was filed by a single stockholder. No date for this hearing on this appeal has been scheduled. Under Delaware law, our bylaws and certain indemnification agreements, we may have an obligation to indemnify former officers and directors in relation to this matter. Insurance funds from our director and officer liability policies were used in connection with the settlements of the shareholder derivative litigation and securities class action litigation and as a result, we will be required to fund indemnity obligations from claims relating to this matter. If appeals proceed in the shareholder derivative action, and particularly if the stockholder plaintiff succeeds in such appeal, our indemnity obligations could result in significant legal expenses or damages and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer.\nIn connection with claims or litigation, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nGovernment regulations could increase our costs of production and our business could be adversely affected.\nAs a food company, we are subject to extensive government regulation, including regulation of the manufacturing, transportation, processing, product quality, packaging, storage, import, export, distribution and labeling of our products. There may be changes in the legal and regulatory environment, and governmental entities or agencies in jurisdictions where we operate may impose new manufacturing, transportation, processing, packaging, storage, import, export, distribution, labeling or other restrictions, any of which could increase our costs and affect our profitability. For example, in June 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) declared that the use of partially hydrogenated oils in food is no longer \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (often referred to as GRAS), effectively banned the use of partially hydrogenated oils in food, and established a transition period for companies to comply with the new regulations. Some of our products currently contain partially hydrogenated oils, and we are reformulating those products. Additionally, in September 2015, the FDA released major new food safety regulations governing the production and handling of food, and we may incur costs to comply with these new regulations. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these new regulations. To the extent that consumer concerns about partially hydrogenated oils increase or reformulation efforts are not successful, our business and results of operations could also be harmed. In addition, various regulatory authorities and others have paid increasing attention to the effect on humans due to the consumption of acrylamide-a naturally-occurring chemical compound that is formed in the process of cooking many foods, including potato chips, and a potential carcinogen-and have imposed additional regulatory requirements. In the State of California, we are required to warn about the presence of acrylamide and other potential carcinogens in our products. If consumer concerns about acrylamide increase or this or other substances are regulated further or not allowed in food products, demand for affected products could decline or we may be unable to sell some of our products and our revenues and business could be harmed. Efforts to reformulate products may be expensive or unsuccessful or may fail to meet consumer expectations, in which event our revenues or business would be harmed. Our manufacturing operations are subject to various national, regional or state and local laws and regulations that require us to obtain licenses relating to customs, health and safety, building and land use and environmental protection. We are also subject to environmental regulations governing the discharge into the air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials as well as regulations relating to noise and odor. New or amended statutes and regulations, increased production at our existing facilities and our expansion into new operations and jurisdictions may require us to obtain new licenses and permits, could require us to change our methods of operations, and could require us to implement remediation plans, any of which could be costly. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as possible criminal sanctions, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nA disruption at any of our production facilities would significantly decrease production, which could increase our cost of sales and reduce our net sales and income from operations.\nWe process and package our products in several domestic and international facilities and have co-manufacturing agreements and co-pack arrangements with third parties. A temporary or extended interruption in operations at any of our facilities or at our co-packer facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, delays or damage (including destruction) from fire, flood, severe weather or earthquake, infrastructure failures such as power or water shortages, raw material shortage, termination of a co-pack arrangement, dispute with a co-packer, or any other reason, whether or not covered by insurance, could interrupt our manufacturing operations, disrupt communications with our customers and suppliers and cause us to lose sales and write off inventory. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our facilities or our co-packer facilities would have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture and package our products on our own or have our products manufactured and packaged and may cause us to seek additional third-party arrangements, thereby increasing production costs. These third parties may not be as efficient as we are and may not have the capabilities to process and package some of our products, which could adversely affect sales or operating income. Further, current and potential customers might not purchase our products if they perceive our lack of alternate manufacturing facilities to be a risk to their continuing source of products.\nNatural disasters can disrupt our operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA natural disaster such as an earthquake, tornado, fire, drought, flood, or severe storm or other catastrophic event affecting our operating activities or major facilities, could cause an interruption or delay in our business and loss of inventory and/or data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. We are particularly susceptible to earthquakes as our executive offices and nut operations are located in California where earthquakes periodically occur. Additionally, our popcorn co-packer is located in Indiana, where tornados periodically occur. If operations are damaged by an earthquake, tornado or other disaster, we may be subject to supply interruptions, destruction of our facilities and products or other business disruptions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nChanges in the food industry, including changing dietary trends and consumer preferences and adverse publicity about Diamond and the health effects of consuming some products could reduce demand for our products.\nConsumer tastes can change rapidly as a result of many factors, including shifting consumer preferences, dietary trends and purchasing patterns. To address consumer preferences, we invest significant resources in research and development of new products. Dietary trends, such as the consumption of food low in carbohydrate content, have in the past, and may in the future, harm our sales. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to consumer trends, or if new products we develop do not achieve acceptance by retailers or consumers, demand for our products could decline or we may discontinue products and incur related write-downs, any of which could in turn cause our revenue and profitability to be lower.\nIn addition, some of our products contain sodium, preservatives and other ingredients, the health effects of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of these ingredients can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. In the United States and other countries, there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, associated with consumption of these ingredients, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products. The continuing global focus on health and wellness, including weight management, could adversely affect our sales or lead to stricter regulation, as well as increase our risk of litigation by governmental and private parties. For example, in June 2015, the FDA adopted new regulations effectively banning (subject to a transition period and an exemption application process) the use of partially hydrogenated oils in food, which certain of our products currently contain.\nAdditionally, we believe consumers are looking increasingly for all natural products. From time to time we have been subject to lawsuits challenging our product labeling practices, including with respect to natural claims, and may be sued for such practices in the future. These lawsuits can be expensive to defend. Moreover, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or adverse publicity about our products (including the resources needed to produce them) could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence or customer relations, and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations or even if the adverse publicity regarding our products is unfounded.\nIncreased costs associated with product processing and transportation, such as water, electricity, natural gas, fuel and labor costs, could increase our expenses and reduce our profitability.\nWe require a substantial amount of energy and water to make our products. Transportation costs, including fuel and labor, also represent a significant portion of the cost of our products, because we use third party truck and rail companies to collect our raw materials and deliver our products to our distributors and customers. Labor is also an important component of our production costs. These costs fluctuate significantly over time due to factors that may be beyond our control, including\nincreased fuel prices, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, employee strikes or work slowdowns, regulation (including increases in minimum wage rates in the U.S., California and U.K.) and increased export and import restrictions. We may not be able to pass on increased costs of production or transportation to our customers. In addition, from time to time, transportation service providers have a backlog of shipping requests, which could impact our ability to ship products in a timely fashion. Increases in the cost of water, electricity, natural gas, fuel or labor and failure to ship products on time, could increase our costs of production and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe loss of any major customer or material changes in their purchases could decrease sales and adversely impact our net income.\nWe depend on a few significant customers for a large proportion of our net sales. This concentration has become more pronounced with the trend toward consolidation in the retail grocery store industry. Sales to our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (which includes sales to both Sam\u2019s Club and Wal-Mart), represented approximately 17%, 16% and 16% of our total net sales in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with these customers, or any other significant customer. Further, there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation, which can create significant cost and margin pressure on our business and also put existing business relationships at risk. The loss of any major customers, or any other significant customer, or a material decrease in their purchases from us (whether as a result of customer inventory practices, a decrease in such customer\u2019s business, a response to a price increase or otherwise), could result in decreased sales and adversely impact our net income.\nThe consolidation of retail customers could adversely affect us.\nRetail customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, continue to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business. Consolidation also produces larger, more sophisticated retail customers that can resist price increases and demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs or specifically tailored products. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. Further retail consolidation and increasing retail power could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to compete effectively with other manufacturers or with retailer brands, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur branded products face competition from private label products (retailer brands) that may be sold at lower price points. The impact of price gaps between our products and private label products may result in share erosion and harm our business. A number of our competitors have broader product lines, substantially greater financial and other resources and/or lower fixed costs than we have. Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products that are more attractive to customers or consumers than ours or may sell branded products at lower price points. These competitors may also prove to be more successful in marketing and selling their products than we are; and may be better able to increase prices to reflect cost pressures. We may not compete successfully with these other companies or maintain or grow the distribution of our products. We cannot predict the pricing, commodity costs, or promotional activities of our competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us. Many of our competitors engage in aggressive pricing and promotional activities. There are competitive pressures and other factors which could cause our products to lose market share, decline in sales, or result in significant price or margin erosion, which would have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill, other intangible assets or tangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.\nA significant portion of our assets are goodwill and other intangible assets, the majority of which are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current fair value, the asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value resulting in a non-cash charge to earnings. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common stock, increased competition or loss of market share, product innovation or obsolescence, or product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life. To the extent our market capitalization (increased by a reasonable control premium) results in a fair value of our common stock that is below our net book value, or if other indicators of potential impairment are present, then we will be required to take further steps to determine if an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets has occurred and to calculate an impairment loss. If there are future changes in our stock price, or significant changes in the business climate or operating results of our reporting units, we may incur impairment charges related to our intangible assets and goodwill which would negatively impact our consolidated operating results and further reduce our stock price. At July 31, 2015, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $779.0 million, compared to total assets of approximately $1,212.7 million and total shareholders\u2019 equity of approximately $308.6 million. At July 31, 2014, the carrying value of\ngoodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $803.1 million, compared to total assets of approximately $1,192.8 million and total shareholders\u2019 equity of approximately $283.8 million.\nOur proprietary brands and packaging designs are essential to the value of our business, and the inability to protect our intellectual property, and costs associated with that protection, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business and results of operations\nOur success depends significantly on our know-how and other intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and similar rights to protect our intellectual property. Our success also depends in large part on our continued ability to use existing trademarks and service marks in order to maintain and increase brand awareness and further develop our brands.\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate. Third parties may misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property or develop more efficient and advanced technologies. Our patents expire over time and third parties may use such previously patented technology to compete against us; our third-party manufacturers and partners may also disclose our trade secrets. From time to time, we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property, which could result in substantial costs as well as diversion of management attention. The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on our key personnel and if we lose the services of any of these individuals, or fail to attract and retain additional key personnel, we may not be able to implement our business strategy or operate our business effectively.\nOur future success largely depends on the contributions of our senior management team. We believe that these individuals\u2019 expertise and knowledge about our industry, their respective fields and their relationships with other individuals in our industry are critical factors to our continued growth and success. We do not carry key person insurance. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team and the failure to hire and retain qualified management and other key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business and prospects. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified sales, marketing and other personnel.\nEconomic downturns may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic conditions may negatively affect our business and financial results. Poor economic conditions could negatively impact consumer demand for our products, the mix of our products\u2019 sales, our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis, the ability of suppliers to provide the materials required in our operations, and our ability to obtain financing or to otherwise access the capital markets. The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe acquisition or divestiture of product lines or businesses could pose risks to our business and the market price of our common stock.\nWe may review acquisition prospects that we believe could complement our existing business. There is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating or consummating any future acquisitions. Any such future acquisitions could result in accounting charges, potentially dilutive issuances of stock and increased debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material effect on our business and the market price of our common stock. Acquisitions entail many financial, managerial and operational risks, including difficulties integrating the acquired operations, effective and immediate implementation of internal control over financial reporting, diversion of management attention during the negotiation and integration phases, uncertainty entering markets in which we have limited prior experience, and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations. We may be unable to integrate product lines or businesses that we acquire, which could have a material effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock. We may evaluate the various components of our portfolio of businesses and may, as a result, explore divesting such products or businesses. Divestitures have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions (including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals), the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses, unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our integrated information technology systems and other operating systems and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. In addition, adverse economic or market conditions may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful divestiture efforts. Transaction costs may be high, and expected cost savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested businesses, may be difficult to achieve, and we may experience varying success in reducing costs or transferring liabilities previously associated with the divested businesses. In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may result in litigation that can be expensive and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our core business.\nOur business and operations could be negatively impacted if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nThe success of our business depends substantially upon our ability to maintain satisfactory relations with our employees. Our production workforce in one of our facilities is covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expires in March 2018. Strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew this agreement on satisfactory terms or if there are efforts to unionize our workforce in other locations. If a work stoppage or slow down were to occur, it could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations. The terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements, or new agreements (if we are required to recognize a union in a new location), also could increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to our business.\nUnauthorized access to confidential information and data on our information technology systems, security and data breaches, and inappropriate use of or negative exposure through social media could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs part of our operations, we rely on our computer systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to manage inventory, process transactions, and process, transmit and store electronic information, communicate with our suppliers and other third parties, and on continued and unimpeded access to secure network connections to use our computer systems. We have physical, technical and procedural safeguards in place that are designed to protect information and protect against security and data breaches as well as fraudulent transactions and other activities. Despite these safeguards and our other security processes and protections, we cannot be assured that all of our systems and processes, including those managed by third parties, are free from vulnerability to security breaches (through cyber attacks, which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, physical breach or other means) or inadvertent data disclosure by third parties or by us. A significant data security breach, including misappropriation of customer, consumer, distributor or employee confidential information, or other technology breakdown could cause us to incur significant costs, which may include potential cost of investigations, legal, forensic and consulting fees and expenses, costs and diversion of management attention required for investigation, remediation and litigation, substantial repair or replacement costs. Furthermore, if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive and business harm. We could also experience data losses either by us, or the third parties we rely on to manage certain computer systems, that would impair our ability to manage inventories or process transactions and the negative impact on our reputation and loss of confidence of our customers, distributors, suppliers and others, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage. Negative posts or comments about the Company or its brands on any social networking web site could seriously damage our reputation or the reputation of our brands. In addition, the disclosure of non-public information through external media vehicles could lead to information loss and other issues. Identifying new points of entry as social media, and our use of social media, continues to expand presents new challenges. Any business interruptions, information loss or damage to our or our brands\u2019 reputation could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are in the process of upgrading our information technology infrastructure, including implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, and problems with the transition, design or implementation of this upgrade could interfere with our business and operations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are in the process of upgrading our information technology infrastructure, including plans to implement a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and other complementary information technology systems. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the upgrade, including but not limited to the transition, design and implementation of a new ERP system, which may be disruptive to our underlying business. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the transition, design and implementation of the upgrade and new ERP system, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on the implementation of our overall information technology infrastructure. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new upgraded systems and processes including loss of data, ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations, generally conduct financial reporting and file SEC reports in a timely manner and otherwise run our business. We may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems, increased costs and lost revenues. In addition, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our information technology infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Even if we do not encounter these adverse effects, the transition, design and implementation of the upgrade and new ERP system may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the upgrade and new ERP system as planned, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service requirements that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our debt obligations, place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe have incurred and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our high debt service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, and might limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on, our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate requirements. We may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. This high degree of leverage could have other important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy obligations with respect to the 7.000% Notes due 2019 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and our other indebtedness, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, which could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes or the agreements governing our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because our debt arrangements will be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from pursuing.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including our obligations under the Notes, will depend upon, among other things, our future operating performance and our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary. Each of these factors is, to a large extent, dependent on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If, in the future, we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations, we will need to refinance our debt, obtain additional financing, issue additional equity or sell assets. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow or that we will be able to obtain funding sufficient to satisfy our debt service requirements.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt. This could further increase the risks associated with our significant indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur additional substantial indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, the terms of our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan facility and the indenture governing the Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more likely that we will experience some or all of the risks associated with substantial indebtedness.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreements governing our debt arrangements contain various covenants that may limit our ability or the ability of our domestic subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions that may be in our long-term best interests. These covenants limit our ability, among other things to:\n\u2022\nborrow money or guarantee debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with other companies.\nThese covenants limit our operational flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. A breach of any of these covenants or other provisions in our debt agreements could result in an event of default that,\nif not cured or waived, could result in such debt becoming immediately due and payable. This, in turn, could cause our other debt to become due and payable as a result of cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions contained in the agreements governing such other debt. In the event that some or all of our debt is accelerated and becomes immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, such debt.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and may result in investors selling shares of our common stock at a loss.\nThe trading price of our common stock is volatile and subject to fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our revenues, earnings, prospects or recommendations of securities analysts who follow our stock or our industry;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry by any securities analysts who follow our stock or our industry;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press, investment community or social media;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions, including economic factors unrelated to our performance\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our core business.\nWe issued a substantial number of shares pursuant to the exercise of an outstanding warrant issued to an entity managed by Oaktree, and the trading of those shares in the open market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOn February 19, 2014 an entity managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cOaktree\u201d) exercised a warrant to purchase 4.42 million shares of our common stock, representing approximately 14% of our common stock. The volatility in the trading price of our common stock may increase if and when Oaktree decides to sell shares.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our strategy.\nThe timing and amount of our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may vary significantly as a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nthe need to make large capital expenditures to support and expand production capacity;\n\u2022\nthe existence of opportunities for expansion; and\n\u2022\naccess to and availability of sufficient management, technical, marketing and financial personnel.\nIf our capital resources are not sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain other debt financing. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Additional debt would result in increased expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations. With the exception of the ABL Facility, we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and lenders are not obligated to fund the \u201caccordion\u201d feature in our Term Loan Facility. We may not be able to obtain additional financing, if required, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock may be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.\nFurther, some provisions of our charter documents, including provisions establishing a classified board of directors, eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters\nat a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or our management, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock. Further, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will prohibit an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if such combination is favored by a majority of stockholders, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. All of the foregoing could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or management.", "PERMNO": 90807, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "DMND"}
