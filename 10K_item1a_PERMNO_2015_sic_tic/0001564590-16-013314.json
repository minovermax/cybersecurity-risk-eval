We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nNumerous general economic and industry factors which we do not control have significant impacts on the automotive industry, our primary market, and resulting difficulties in the automotive industry or for our key customers and suppliers would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOur automotive segment represents a substantial majority of our product revenues. Demand for our automotive products is directly related to automotive vehicle production, which is impacted by numerous general economic and industry factors which we do not control. In particular, the automotive industry has been susceptible historically in the U.S. and globally to economic recessions, labor disputes, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, government initiatives and the availability and cost of credit. Disruptions in the global economy and volatility in the financial markets may cause, among other things, lower levels of liquidity, increased borrowing rates, increased rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, and lower consumer net worth, all of which may reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also limited in our ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn given certain fixed costs associated with our operations, difficulties if we overstrained our resources, and our long-term business approach that necessitates we remain in position to respond when market conditions improve.\nThe U.S. market growth and recovery from the 2009 market crash has begun to slow, Europe is beginning to slowly come out of the latest recession, and there has been softening demand in China for high-end cars. Unfavorable economic or industry conditions could result in the financial distress of our customers and suppliers. If our customers experience a decline in vehicle sales, or in sales of models for which we supply products, we may experience reductions in orders from these customers, experience difficulties in obtaining new business, incur write-offs of accounts receivable, incur impairment charges or require restructuring actions. In addition, if any of our significant customers experiences a material work stoppage, the customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products. This could require us to shut down or significantly reduce production at facilities relating to such products, which could adversely affect our business and harm our profitability.\nAutomotive sales and production are highly cyclical and depend on, among other things, general economic conditions and consumer spending and preferences, none of which are in our control. In particular, automotive manufacturers and suppliers across Europe have been experiencing difficulties over the past few years from a weakened economy, tightening credit markets and instability of the Euro. A prolonged downturn in the European automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could result in impairment charges, restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Continued uncertainty relating to the economic conditions in Europe may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. In Asia, the rapid growth experienced in developing countries, such as China, at the beginning of this century has shown signs of slowing in recent years. A significant slow-down in the developing Asian economy growth rate could materially affect the demand for cars manufactured and sold by our customers in the affected countries, resulting in a material negative impact on our business.\nAdverse economic and financial conditions make it very difficult to forecast operating results, make business decisions and identify and address material business risks. The foregoing conditions may also impact the valuation of our Federal Net Operating Loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) which are subject to impairment testing, potentially resulting in impairment charges which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations. See our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for a more complete description of our NOLs.\nIf our expansion efforts are not successfully implemented, they may adversely impact our business and results of operations\nAs a result of a significant increase in demand for our products over the past few years and to support our customers\u2019 global platform initiatives, we are in the process of opening facilities in Vietnam and in Macedonia and, therefore, significantly increasing our capacity to manufacture our products. A new facility in central Mexico is expected to be operating by the end of the third quarter of 2016. These new facilities, as well as our current production facilities elsewhere in the world, could have significant unused capacity if our revenues do not continue to increase as they have in recent years. Significant unused capacity would result in overhead costs that would need to be absorbed by a smaller than expected revenue base, which could materially and adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, the construction of new manufacturing facilities entails a number of risks, including our ability to successfully manage the demands placed on our management resources and engineering and quality teams, our ability to begin production at levels and within the cost and timeframe estimated, and our ability to attract and maintain a sufficient number of skilled workers at the requisite locations to meet the needs of the new facilities. The construction of new manufacturing facilities in foreign countries is subject to additional risks inherent in doing business abroad, which are described in further detail below. Our assessment of the projected benefits associated with the construction of new manufacturing facilities is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions, which in turn are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties. If we experience delays or increased costs, our estimates and assumptions are incorrect, or other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial conditions and\nresults of operations could be adversely impacted. Our results of operations could also be adversely impacted by start-up costs until production levels at the new facilities reach planned levels.\nWe may not be able to commercialize, market and sell additional products to other industries\nAlthough non-automotive applications represented a small portion of our total revenues in 2015, we are currently investing significant capital and utilizing key employees to improve existing products and to develop products and research technologies to be used in a wide range of industries. For example, we are working to increase sales of our products in the bed, office chair, cup holder, thermal storage bins and other markets and to develop new products including battery thermal management devices, heated and cooled office chairs, surgeon\u2019s helmets and other medical products. As we expand into new markets, we will face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these market segments, from existing manufacturers with established customer bases and greater brand recognition. To be successful, we need to cultivate new relationships with customers and partners in these market segments. Furthermore, although we have made significant improvements in TED technology and we believe that a number of new products have become practical at our current stage of TED advancement, additional improvements are necessary to make certain TED-based products commercially attractive in comparison with other technologies for the major markets which we are targeting. These advancements are dependent on many variables, including but not limited to new advanced materials becoming available and efficient and cost effective manufacturing processes for advanced TEDs and the related materials being developed. There can be no assurance that these advances will occur in a timely or feasible way, that the funds that we have budgeted for these purposes will be adequate, or that we will be able to establish our proprietary right to these technologies. Further, there is no certainty that any advancement in TEDs will be commercially viable or that we will be successful in generating significant revenues from non-automotive sales for any of our existing or future products.\nOur ability to market our products is subject to a lengthy sales and acceptance cycle, which requires significant investment prior to significant sales revenues\nThe sales cycle for our automotive products, our largest industry segment, is lengthy because an automobile manufacturer must develop a high degree of assurance that the products it buys will meet customer needs, interface as easily as possible with the other parts of a vehicle and with the automobile manufacturer\u2019s production and assembly process, and have minimal warranty, safety and service problems. As a result, from the time that a manufacturer develops a strong interest in our products for a specified vehicle, it normally will take several years before our products are available to consumers in that vehicle.\nIn the automotive components industry, products typically proceed through five stages of research and development. Initial research on the product concept comes first, to assess its technical feasibility and economic costs and benefits. This stage often includes development of an internal prototype for the component supplier\u2019s own evaluation. If the product appears feasible, the component supplier manufactures a functioning prototype to demonstrate and test the product\u2019s features. These prototypes are then marketed and sold to automotive companies for testing and evaluation. If an automobile manufacturer shows interest in the product, it typically works with the component supplier to refine the product, then purchases second and subsequent generation engineering prototypes for further evaluation. Finally, the automobile manufacturer either decides to purchase the component for a production vehicle or terminates the program.\nThe time required to progress through these five stages to commercialization varies widely. Generally, the more a component must be integrated with other vehicle systems, the longer the process takes. Further, products that are installed by the factory usually require extra time for evaluation because other vehicle systems are affected, and a decision to introduce the product into the vehicle is not easily reversed. Because our automotive products affect other vehicle systems and are factory-installed items, the process usually takes several years from conception to commercialization.\nWhile we currently have active development programs with various seat manufacturers and OEMs for our automotive seat temperature control products, no assurance can be given that our products will be implemented in any particular vehicles. During this development process, we derive minimal funding from prototype sales but generally obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. If our products are not selected after a lengthy development process, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOther products that we develop or significantly update are also likely to have a lengthy sales cycle. Because such technology is new and evolving, and because customers will likely require any new product or significantly changed product that we develop to pass certain feasibility, safety and economic viability tests before committing to purchase, it is expected that any new or significantly changed products we develop will take some years before they are sold to customers, if at all.\nOur ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers and consumers, as well as the success of our customers\nWe have been, and will continue to be, required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of our existing products justify the costs associated with them. Similar efforts will be required with potential customers for additional products we develop using technologies we develop or license. Manufacturers will only include our products if there appears to be demand for our products from the consumers. For our automotive products, we rely on OEMs and applicable dealer networks to market our products to consumers, and we do not have any control over the marketing budget or messaging nor the training of employees and agents regarding our products. Further, OEMs and dealer networks may market products offered by our competitors, including products manufactured by such OEMs. If customers or consumers conclude that temperature control seats or our other products are unnecessary or too expensive or that our competitors offer more favorable terms or better products, OEMs and other manufacturers may reduce or decline to include our products in their vehicles.\nIn addition, the vehicle market is highly competitive among OEMs, which drives continual cost-cutting initiatives by our customers. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margin, rate of profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe must also satisfy the timing, performance and quality standards of our customers and consumers during mass production. Further, we are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers\u2019 continuation of existing vehicles and introduction of new vehicles which include our products. If such vehicles are not successful in the marketplace, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nSignificant increases in the market prices and restrictions on the availability of certain raw materials may adversely affect our business\nMany of our products include TEDs which contain certain raw materials that generally cannot be substituted. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. We generally have no contractual price protections with our suppliers and customers regarding raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability if we cannot recover these increases from our customers. As an example, Tellurium is a raw material used in TEDs. If the market price for this raw material significantly increases, as it has in the past, our gross profit may be adversely impacted as our suppliers pass those price increases on to us. Other key raw materials include copper, silver and petroleum based engineered plastics. In addition, the availability of raw materials fluctuates from time to time due to factors outside our control. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by shortages in key raw materials.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes\nWe internally manufacture a large and growing portion of our products at our eight production facilities. See Item 2. below for information regarding our properties. Other products we sell are manufactured by third parties. A catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of our facilities due to accident, fire, explosion, labor issues, civil unrest, weather conditions, other natural disaster or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that our primary manufacturing locations are in Mexico, China, and the Ukraine, all countries that have historically experienced a heightened degree of political, civil and labor uncertainty. New manufacturing locations in Vietnam, Macedonia and central Mexico were opened in 2015 or are expected to open in 2016, and the Company\u2019s lack of operating history in these regions may increase such risks as well.\nPolitical conflict and related demonstrations and violence in the Ukraine in recent years, for example, highlight the risks to our foreign manufacturing facilities. Although our manufacturing facility in the Ukraine is located approximately 700 miles by road from Kiev, and approximately the same distance from the activities along the border of the Ukraine and Russia where fighting has occurred, we cannot be certain that similar demonstrations, unrest and international tensions will not affect our facility in the future. Furthermore, most of our products manufactured in the Ukraine are shipped across the border from the Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed for any reason, we would essentially experience a loss of the use of our Ukrainian facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnexpected failures of our equipment and machinery also may result in production delays, revenue loss and significant repair costs, injuries to our employees, and customer claims. Any interruption in production capability may require us to delay fulfilling orders, utilize less efficient internal facilities on a temporary basis and make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows.\nThe disruption or loss of relationships with vendors and suppliers for the components for our products could materially adversely\naffect our business\nOur ability to manufacture and market our products successfully is dependent on relationships with both third party vendors and suppliers. We rely on various vendors and suppliers for the components of our products and procure these components through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Certain components are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The loss of any significant supplier, in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement, or an inability to obtain essential components on reasonable terms or at all, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business also could be materially and adversely affected by delays in deliveries from suppliers because we carry minimal inventory of product components. Automobile manufacturers, in particular, demand on-time delivery of quality products, and some have required the payment of substantial financial penalties for failure to deliver components to their plants on a timely basis. Such penalties, as well as costs to avoid them, such as overtime costs and overnight air freighting of parts that normally are shipped by other less expensive means of transportation due to our global production operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the inability to meet demand for our products on a timely basis would materially adversely affect our reputation and future commercial prospects.\nFurther, we engage outside contractors to perform product assembly and other production functions for certain of our products. Our reliance upon third party contractors for certain production functions reduces our control over the manufacture of our products and makes us dependent in part upon such third parties to deliver our products in a timely manner, with satisfactory quality controls and on a competitive basis. If we are unable to meet commitments to our customers due to third party services in production, our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur global operations subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results\nWe have significant personnel, property, equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of the United States, including Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, Mexico, Ukraine and Vietnam. We have also engaged third parties to produce products for us in China and Japan. We and these third parties maintain production facilities in lower-cost countries for cost containment reasons. Our exposure to the risks described below is substantial and increasing. We also derive a significant portion of revenues from Europe and Asia and conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies.\nIn addition to the general risks relating to our operations, our international operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:\n\u00b7\nexposure to local economic conditions and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\ndifferent and complex local laws and regulations and enforcement thereof, including those relating to governance, taxes, litigation, anti-corruption, employment, employee benefits, environmental, competition, permitting, investment, repatriation, and export/import restrictions or requirements;\n\u00b7\nU.S. laws and regulations affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, which could be changed without notice;\n\u00b7\npolitical, economic and civil instability (including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war);\n\u00b7\nexpropriation, nationalization or other protectionist activities;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; in particular, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Hungarian Forint, the Mexican Peso, the Ukrainian Hryvnia and the Canadian Dollar;\n\u00b7\ndiffering tax rates, as well as withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nincreases in working capital requirements and greater potential for production and delivery delays due to extended logistics and geo-political developments;\n\u00b7\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in due to anti-corruption laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7\nglobal sovereign fiscal matters and creditworthiness, including potential defaults and the related impacts on economic activity, including the possible effects on credit markets, currency values, monetary unions, international treaties and fiscal policies.\nSee \u201cOur business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes\u201d above for a description of the specific risks associated with our facility in the Ukraine.\nLower oil prices may adversely impact our Gentherm Global Power Technologies (GPT) business\nA large portion of our GPT products is sold to companies in the oil and gas industry. In particular, a number of GPT products pertain to new oil and gas pipelines and wells. The number of new pipelines and wells may be adversely affected by lower oil and gas commodity prices. The price of oil, in particular, has recently experienced significant price declines. If the price of oil is relatively low, the number of new oil explorations and installations could be reduced considerably, which could adversely affect our GPT business.\nAny failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results\nOur operations outside of the United States require us to comply with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law. We have internal control policies and procedures, and we have implemented training and compliance programs for our employees and agents, with respect to these regulations. However, our policies, procedures and programs may not always protect us from negligent, reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. We could incur significant expenses in investigating any potential violation and could incur severe criminal or civil sanctions and/or fines as a result of violations or settlements regarding such laws. In addition, any allegations, settlements or violations could materially and adversely impact our reputation and our relationships with current and future customers, suppliers, employees and agents. Also, some of our competitors may not be subject to, or similarly comply with, the same anti-corruption laws, which could provide them a competitive advantage.\nWe are subject to significant currency risk related to our global operations\nA significant portion of our global transactions is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. While we sometimes employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, developing an effective and economical foreign currency risk strategy is complex and expensive and no strategy can completely insulate us from those exposures. Hedging arrangements also may expose us to additional risks, including that a counterparty may fail to honor its obligations, and additional costs, including transaction fees and breakage costs. Changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies could significantly affect our reported results of operations and financial condition. For example, a significant portion of our business activities is conducted in Euros, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro had a negative effect on our reported revenues in 2015.\nIn addition, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain European countries that have adopted the Euro currency (the \"Euro Zone\") and their ability to meet future financial obligations, as well as concerns regarding the overall stability of the Euro to function as a single currency among the diverse economic, social and political circumstances within the Euro Zone. If one of the Euro Zone countries were to default on its debt or withdraw from the Euro currency, the impact on global markets, and on our business, results of operations and financial condition, could be significant, and that impact would intensify substantially if the Euro currency were dissolved entirely. Such a development could also cause financial and capital markets across the globe to constrict, reducing liquidity and increasing borrowing costs, and could have a significant negative impact on consumer confidence and spending.\nThe automotive industry is subject to intense competition and our current automotive products may be rendered obsolete by future technological developments in the industry\nThe automotive component industry, from which we derive a substantial majority of our revenues, is subject to intense competition. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, timely delivery, technological innovation and service. In addition, customers often demand periodic price reductions during a vehicle\u2019s life that require us to continually assess, redefine and improve our operations, products and manufacturing capabilities to maintain and improve profitability.\nMany of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Competitors are promoting new products that may compete with our products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors, that the marketplace will consider our current or proposed products to be superior or even comparable to those of our competitors, or that we can succeed in establishing new or maintaining existing relationships with automobile manufacturers.\nDue to the rapid pace of technological change, as with any technology-based product, our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop and license improved technologies on a rapid and cost-efficient basis. Our business will therefore\nrequire extensive capital expenditures and investment in product development, manufacturing and management information systems. Further, our products may be rendered obsolete by future technologies of competitors or consumer preferences. Our operations, financial results and competitive position would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to anticipate such future developments and develop, or obtain access, to critical new technologies at a reasonable cost. An inability to compete successfully may also hinder our ability to complete acquisitions or financings on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property developed or licensed could harm our business and competitive position\nWe believe that patents and proprietary rights have been and will continue to be very important in enabling us to compete. If our patents are circumvented, rendered invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, the patent coverage afforded to our products would be impaired, which could significantly impede our ability to market our products, negatively affect our competitive position and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that any new or pending patents will be issued, that our or our licensors\u2019 proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable, or that our patents will provide us with meaningful competitive advantages. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or will not design around any patents that have been or may be issued to our licensors or us. Also, failure to seek or obtain patents in certain foreign countries may materially adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in those international markets. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, such as China, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Foreign governments may adopt regulations-and foreign governments or courts may render decisions-requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights, or foreign governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies.\nBecause of rapid technological developments in the automotive industry and the competitive nature of the market, the patent position of any component manufacturer is subject to uncertainties and may involve complex legal and factual issues. Consequently, although we either own or have licenses to certain patents, and are currently processing a significant number of additional patent applications, it is possible that no patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims allowed in any existing or future patents issued or licensed to us will be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or that any rights granted under such patents will not provide us adequate protection. There is an additional risk that we may be required to participate in interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions or may be required to commence litigation to protect our rights, which could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of management and technical and engineering personnel. We are currently involved in legal proceedings to enforce our patent rights against competitors. There can be no certainty that those proceedings will be decided in our favor, as to the timing of any resolution, or the significant costs we may incur to litigate such matters.\nTo the extent that consultants, key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information that may not be resolved in our favor. Additionally, with respect to licensed technology, there can be no assurance that the licensor of the technology will have the resources, financial or otherwise, or desire to defend against any challenges to the rights of such licensor to its patents.\nOur products may conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to competitors or others\nOther persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of our products for allegedly conflicting with patents held by them. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us, divert the attention of management and engineering and technical personnel, and harm our reputation. If any such actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to cease selling or using infringing products, obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products, or redesign the infringing products. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such action, that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we could redesign such products on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost, if at all. Failure to obtain needed patents, licenses or proprietary information held by others may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties suggesting that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others. While we believe that none of the claims of infringement received to date are valid, we must spend time and resources reviewing, defending and resolving such claims.\nWe rely on trade secret protection through confidentiality agreements and the agreements could be breached or information may be otherwise stolen\nWe rely on trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, customers and other parties. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.\nThe theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products, as well as the value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing. In addition, third parties might make claims against us related to losses of confidential or proprietary information, end-user data or system reliability. These incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nOur most significant customers typically reserve the right unilaterally to cancel contracts or reduce prices, and the exercise of such right could reduce or eliminate any financial benefit to us anticipated from such contract\nDue to their purchasing size, automotive customers typically reserve the right unilaterally to cancel contracts completely or to require price reductions during the term of the contract. Although these customers generally agree as a commercial practice to reimburse companies for actual out-of-pocket costs incurred with respect to the particular contract up to the point of cancellation, these reimbursements typically do not cover costs associated with acquiring general purpose assets, such as facilities and capital equipment, or for increases in employee count and related costs, and may be subject to negotiation and substantial delays in receipt by us. Any unilateral cancellation of, or price reduction with respect to, any contract could reduce or eliminate any financial benefits anticipated from such contract. If we are not able to offset pricing reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, such price reduction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe third parties that have agreed to reimburse portions of our research and development expenses generally also reserve the right to unilaterally terminate those contracts. There can be no assurance that we will continue to receive the third party reimbursements for any of our research and development efforts.\nA significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers, or an investigation regarding vehicle safety generally, could adversely affect our financial performance\nIn the event that our products fail to perform as expected, whether allegedly due to our fault or that of one of our suppliers, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or we may be required or requested by our customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. We also are a party to agreements with certain of our customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims , but such coverage may be limited. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOver the past couple of years, there has been a significant increase in the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. Inquiries are being conducted not only by traditional regulators but also by state Attorneys General, and the U.S. Department of Justice has commenced investigations and U.S. Congressional hearings have also been conducted in which vehicle manufacturers and in some cases suppliers are being called to testify as to particular safety risks. This increased scrutiny could adversely affect the business of our customers and suppliers and subject us to fines, penalties, sanctions and/or investigations.\nOur success will depend in large part on retaining key personnel and effective succession planning\nOur success will depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of key personnel. The loss of the services of Daniel Coker, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Frithjof Oldorff, President of the Automotive Business Unit, or other officers could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to retain qualified engineering and other technical and marketing personnel. There is significant competition for technologically qualified personnel in our business and we may not be successful in recruiting or retaining sufficient qualified personnel.\nWe are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment inside and outside the United States, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Environmental liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. No assurance can be given that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner or operator of our properties or former properties has created an environmental condition not known\nto us. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Violations of these requirements could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination, third party property damage or personal injury claims due to the migration of contaminants off-site, or modification or revocation of our operating permits, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not realize significant benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures because of integration difficulties and other challenges\nWe are actively pursuing acquisition activities to expand the breadth of products derived from core thermal technologies as well as the markets in which they are applied. The acquisition integration process is complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of completing and integrating an acquisition include, among others:\n\u00b7\nincurring additional debt and/or issuing additional securities, increasing leverage risks or dilution;\n\u00b7\nunsatisfactory returns on our investments and our inability to realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in implementing our business plan for the combined business, including achieving anticipated synergies in amount and on time;\n\u00b7\nsignificant capital expenditures may be required to integrate our operations and pursue synergies;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, financial and other internal controls, communications and other systems;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management attention and capital from ongoing business concerns to integration matters;\n\u00b7\nchallenges assimilating management and other personnel, including because of differences in culture, language and background for international acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nthe size of operations acquired relative to our existing business;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nfailure to obtain regulatory or other approvals;\n\u00b7\nfailure to retain key employees, customers and suppliers of the combined business;\n\u00b7\nassumption of known and unknown liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify; and\n\u00b7\nnon-cash impairment charges or other accounting charges relating to the acquired assets.\nTo the extent we complete an acquisition in a new industry, the above risks will be heightened due to our lack of familiarity with such business.\nIn the future, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or joint venture opportunities or complete any particular acquisition, combination, joint venture or other transaction on acceptable terms. Our identification of suitable acquisition candidates and joint venture opportunities and the integration of acquired business operations involve risks inherent in assessing the values, strengths, weaknesses, risks and profitability of these opportunities, as well as significant competition for such acquisition opportunities. Our focus on acquisition opportunities may require significant financial, management and related resources that would otherwise be used for the ongoing development of our existing operations and internal expansion.\nWe may not generate enough liquid assets to fund our ongoing operations and investments and service our debt\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our cash on hand along with cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure needs and to service our debt for the foreseeable future. However, if cash flows from operations decline, we may need to obtain alternative sources of capital and reduce or delay capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, all of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, it is likely that we will need to complete one or more equity or debt financings if we consummate any significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available at all or on reasonable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our future operations and business strategy.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations, and such substantial debt service obligations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flows from operations in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to effect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur debt obligations could have important consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example:\n\u00b7\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows for other purposes, including for working capital, dividends, capital expenditures, business development efforts and to finance mergers and acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to borrow additional debt for operations, working capital or to finance future mergers and acquisitions may be limited;\n\u00b7\nour ability to refinance or repay other debt obligations when they become due may be limited;\n\u00b7\nwe are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of our borrowings, including under our credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest; and\n\u00b7\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nOur debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: incur additional debt, make certain payments or distributions, engage in mergers or consolidations, make certain dispositions and transfers of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee indebtedness. While not unusual for financings of the type that we have, the restrictions in our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions.\nUpon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to all lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under our credit facilities, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments\nWe receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to fund new investments.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain management, manufacturing, and invoicing and collection of payments. Additionally we collect and store sensitive data, including\nintellectual property, proprietary business information, the proprietary business information of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing, maintenance, confidentiality, integrity and availability of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures, such as disaster recovery and business continuity plans, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Additionally, we cannot provide any assurances as to the adequacy of the security steps taken by our third-party providers. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events, many of which are outside our control, could compromise our networks and the information stored there, which may include confidential or proprietary information of third parties, could be accessed, publicly disclosed, compromised, corrupted, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss or corruption of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, cause a loss of confidence in our reputation, goodwill, products and services, and reduce the competitive advantage we expect to derive from our investment in advanced technologies.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe have anti-takeover defenses that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline\nVarious provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the \u201cMBCA\u201d), could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a third party from accumulating a large block of our capital stock, engaging in a tender offer and making offers to acquire us, and of inhibiting a change in control, all of which could adversely affect our shareholders\u2019 ability to receive a premium for their shares in connection with any such transaction. For example, our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors (our \u201cBoard\u201d) to issue up to 4,991,000 shares of Preferred Stock and to determine the price, rights (including conversion rights), preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our Common Stock, the rights of holders of our Common Stock or the market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nConsistent with this authority, in January 2009 our Board adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (as amended the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) in which one purchase right was distributed as a dividend on each share of Company Common Stock held of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2009 (the \u201cRights\u201d). If exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of a newly created Series B Preferred Stock of the Company for $20.00 (the \u201cPurchase Price\u201d). The Rights will become exercisable if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s Common Stock or has commenced a tender or exchange offer which, if consummated, would result in any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. If any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, each right will entitle its holder, other than the acquiring person, to purchase a number of shares of the Company\u2019s or, in the case of a merger or change in control in favor of the acquirer, the acquirer\u2019s Common Stock having a value of twice the Purchase Price.\nThe Rights are deemed attached to the certificates representing outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Rights Plan is designed to assure that all of our shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to guard against partial tender offers, open market accumulations and other abusive or coercive tactics without paying shareholders a control premium. The Rights Plan may have anti-takeover effects by discouraging potential proxy contests and other takeover methods, particularly those that have not been negotiated with the Board, and the Rights Plan may also inhibit the acquisition of a controlling position in our Common Stock. Therefore, transactions may not occur that shareholders would otherwise support and/or from which they would receive a substantial premium for their shares over the current market price. The Rights Plan may also make it more difficult to remove members of the current Board or management.\nIn addition, the anti-takeover provisions of Michigan law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. For example, the Company is subject to Chapter 7A of the MBCA, which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of five years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless certain conditions are satisfied.\nWe are currently prohibited from making dividend payments on our Common Stock. Furthermore, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock in the future\nOur bank credit facilities generally prohibit payment of dividends on our Common Stock so long as such facilities are outstanding. We have never paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future.\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly\nThe price of our Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including:\n\u00b7\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results due to such factors as acceptance of our product by automotive manufacturers and consumers, timing of our product introductions, availability and pricing of components from third parties, competition, timing of orders, foreign currency exchange rates, new product development, material acquisitions or dispositions, technological changes, resources spent on litigation activities and economic conditions generally;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings guidance by us or earnings estimates by securities analysts with respect to us;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us, the automotive industry generally or automotive supplier industry, and recommendations by securities or financial analysts with respect to us or other automotive suppliers;\n\u00b7\nadverse market reaction to the amount of our outstanding debt at any time, the amount of our maturing debt in the near and medium term and our ability to refinance such debt and the terms thereof or our plans to incur additional debt in the future;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our customers to pay us and meet their other obligations to us under current contract terms and our ability to hold and expand our customer base;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nadverse market reaction to any securities we may register or issue or additional debt we incur in the future;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u00b7\nactions by institutional shareholders;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7\ncontinuing high levels of volatility in the capital and credit markets; and\n\u00b7\nthe realization of any of the other risk factors included in, or incorporated by reference to, this Report on Form 10-K.\nMany of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, regardless of our financial performance and condition and prospects. It is impossible to provide any assurance that the market price of our Common Stock will not fall in the future, and it may be difficult for holders to resell shares of our Common Stock at prices they find attractive, or at all. We expect that the market price of our Common Stock will continue to fluctuate. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur shareholders may experience dilution if we issue additional equity securities\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our Common Stock or preferred stock, including securities convertible or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Common Stock or preferred stock. In most circumstances, common shareholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional equity securities. Future issuances of Common Stock will reduce the percentage of our Common Stock owned by shareholders who do not participate in such issuances. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of additional offerings of our Common Stock and the value of our assets, our shareholders may experience dilution in the book value and fair value of their shares. The market price of our Common Stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of additional shares of our Common Stock in the public market or in connection with future acquisitions, or the perception that such sales could occur. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities at a time and price favorable to us.", "PERMNO": 79248, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "THRM"}
