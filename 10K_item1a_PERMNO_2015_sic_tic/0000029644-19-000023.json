{"cik": "29644", "company": "DONALDSON CO INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-09-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion, along with discussions elsewhere in this report, outlines the risks and uncertainties that we believe are the most material to our business at this time. We undertake no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise unless required by law. The Company\u2019s audit committee reviews the Company\u2019s strategies, processes, and controls with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including risks related to technology systems and cybersecurity, and assists the Board in its oversight of risk management.\nEconomic Environment - the demand for our products is impacted by economic, industrial and political conditions worldwide.\nWe operate a global business and our results and financial condition may be impacted by changes in industrial, economic or political conditions in the geographies and markets we serve.\nProducts - maintaining a competitive advantage requires consistent investment with uncertain returns.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and have numerous competitors that may already be well-established in those markets. We expect our competitors to continue improving the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products that could be competitive in both price and performance. We believe that we have certain technological advantages over our competitors, but maintaining these advantages requires us to consistently invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in maintaining these advantages and we could encounter the commoditization of our key products. We make investments in new technologies that address increased performance and regulatory requirements around the globe. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in completing development or achieving sales of these products or that the margins on such products will be acceptable. A competitor\u2019s successful product innovation could reach the market before ours or gain broader market acceptance.\nEvolving Customer Needs - disruptive technologies may threaten our growth in certain industries.\nOur growth in certain industries guides the decisions we make in operating the Company, but this growth could be threatened by disruptive technologies. We may be adversely impacted by changes in technology that could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products. These risks include wider adoption of technologies providing alternatives to diesel engines such as electrification of equipment. Such disruptive innovation could create new markets and displace existing companies and products, resulting in significantly negative consequences for the Company. If we do not properly address future customer needs, we may be slower to adapt to such disruption.\nCompetition - we participate in highly competitive markets with pricing pressure.\nThe businesses and product lines in which we participate are very competitive and we risk losing business based on a wide range of factors, including price, technology, performance, reliability and availability, geographic coverage and customer service. Our customers continue to seek technological innovation, productivity gains and competitive prices from us and their other suppliers. We may not be able to compete effectively.\nIntellectual Property - demand for our products may be affected by new entrants that copy our products and/or infringe on our intellectual property.\nThe ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions.\nWhere possible, we seek to preserve our intellectual property rights through patents. These patents have a limited life and, in some cases, have expired or will expire in the near future. Competitors and others may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe their intellectual property. We may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined our products infringe on their intellectual property. We may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license on terms that are not favorable to us.\nProtecting or defending against such claims could significantly increase our costs, divert management\u2019s time and attention away from other business matters.\nGlobal Operations - we have a broad footprint and global operations may present challenges.\nWe have operations throughout the world. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks of doing business globally that could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\npolitical and military events, including the rise of nationalism and support for protectionist policies,\n\u2022\ntariffs, trade barriers and other trade restrictions,\n\u2022\nlegal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations, anti-corruption laws, and foreign exchange controls,\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,\n\u2022\ncredit risk of local customers and distributors,\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property, and\n\u2022\nlocal economic, political and social conditions.\nDue to the global reach of our operations, our business is subject to a complex system of commercial and trade laws, regulations and policies, including those related to data privacy, trade compliance, anti-corruption and anti-bribery. Our global subsidiaries, joint venture partners and affiliates are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nThe continued geographic expansion of our business increases our exposure to, and cost of complying with, these laws and regulations. If our compliance programs do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, agents, distributors, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-corruption laws, we may incur defense costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and business disruptions.\nCustomer Concentration and Retention - a number of our customers operate in similar cyclical industries. Economic conditions in these industries could impact our sales.\nNo customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. However, a number of our customers are concentrated in similar cyclical industries (e.g. construction, agriculture, mining, power generation and disk drives), resulting in additional risk based on industrial conditions in those sectors. A decline in the economic conditions of these industries could result in reduced demand for our products and difficulty in collecting amounts due from our customers. Our success is also dependent on retaining key customers, which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products.\nSupply Chain - unavailable raw materials or significant demand fluctuations or material cost inflation.\nWe obtain raw materials, including steel, filter media, petroleum-based products and other components, from third-party suppliers and tend to carry limited raw material inventories. We concentrate our sourcing of some materials from one supplier or a few suppliers. We rely on our suppliers to ensure they meet required quality standards. Our success is dependent on our ability to effectively manage our supplier relationships. Additionally, global supplier production capacity is limited and could be disrupted. We may experience significant disruption of the supply of raw materials, parts, components or final assemblies. An unanticipated delay in delivery by our suppliers could result in the inability to deliver our products on-time and meet the expectations of our customers. We could experience an increase in the costs of doing business, including increasing raw material commodity prices and transportation costs.\nOperations - inability to meet demand could result in the loss of customers.\nOur ability to fulfill customer orders is dependent on our manufacturing and distribution operations. Although we forecast demand, additional plant capacity takes months or even years to bring online, and thus changes in demand could result in longer lead times. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to meet higher product demand, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have underutilized assets. Efficient operations also require streamlining processes to maintain or reduce lead times, which we may not be capable of achieving. Unacceptable levels of service for key customers may result if we are not able to fulfill orders on a timely basis or if product quality or warranty or safety issues result from compromised production. We may not be able to adjust our production schedules to reflect changes in customer demand on a timely basis. Due to the complexity of our manufacturing operations, we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand.\nTechnology Investments and Security Risks - vulnerability with our information technology systems and security.\nWe have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business, some of which are managed by third parties. These systems are used to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems, maintaining and upgrading our existing systems, managing access to these systems and preventing information security breaches. Vulnerabilities could lead to significant additional expenses and/or disruption in business operations.\nAdditionally, information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. We have found and addressed these threats from time to time; however, to date none of them have been material. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Should such an attack succeed, it could lead to the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and could result in litigation, regulatory action, potential liability and increased costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection matters.\nAlthough the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\nCurrency - an unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe have operations in many countries, with a substantial portion of our annual revenue earned in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We face transactional and translational risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Transactional risk arises from changes in the value of cash flows denominated in different currencies. This can be caused by supply chains that cross borders resulting in revenues and costs being in different currencies. Translational risk arises from the re-measurement of our financial statements. In addition, decreased value of local currency may make it difficult for some of our customers, distributors and end users to purchase our products. Each of our subsidiaries reports its results of operations and financial position in its relevant functional currency, which is then translated into U.S. dollars. This translated financial information is included in our consolidated financial statements. Significant fluctuations of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries during discrete periods may have a negative impact on our results and financial position.\nLegal and Regulatory - costs associated with lawsuits, investigations or complying with laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to many laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. We may be adversely impacted by new or changing laws and regulations that affect both our operations and our ability to develop and sell products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements. We are involved in various product liability, product warranty, intellectual property, environmental claims and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. We are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including those governing the environment (e.g. emissions to air; discharges to water; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials) and data protection and privacy. It is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations and lawsuits, and we could incur judgments, fines, or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against any losses.\nIncome Tax - changes in our effective tax rate in various jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the prevailing tax laws and the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities.\nPersonnel - our success may be affected if we are not able to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to identify, recruit, engage, train and retain highly skilled qualified and diverse personnel worldwide and successfully execute management transitions at leadership levels of the Company. There is competition for talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies. Additionally, in some locations we have experienced significant wage inflation due to a shortage of labor amid low levels of unemployment in these markets. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel and it may be difficult for us to compete effectively.\nLiquidity - changes in the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access financing to support strategic initiatives.\nDisruption of the global financial and credit markets may have an effect on our long-term liquidity and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions. Some of our existing borrowings contain covenants to maintain certain financial ratios that, under certain circumstances, could restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments and other restricted payments, create liens and sell assets.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom (UK), the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it no longer will compel or persuade financial institutions and panel banks to make LIBOR submissions after 2021. This decision is expected to result in the end of the use of LIBOR as a reference rate for commercial loans and other indebtedness. We have both LIBOR-denominated and Euro Interbank Offer Rate (EURIBOR)-denominated indebtedness or derivative instruments. The transition to alternatives to LIBOR could be modestly disruptive to the credit markets, and while we do not believe that the impact would be material to us, we do not yet have insight into what the impacts might be.\nAcquisitions - the execution of our acquisition strategy may not provide the desired return on investment.\nWe have made and continue to pursue acquisitions. These acquisitions could negatively impact our profitability due to operating and integration inefficiencies, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets. There are also a number of other risks involved in acquisitions, including the potential loss of key customers, difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations, the loss of key employees and the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from other business matters, that may prevent us from realizing the anticipated return on our investment.\nImpairment - if our operating units do not meet performance expectations, intangible assets could be subject to impairment.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions. We review annually whether goodwill and other intangible assets have been impaired, or more frequently if there have been unexpected events or changes in circumstances. If future operating performance at one or more of our operating units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of our acquired businesses were to decline, we could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment charge would have an adverse non-cash impact on our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nProductivity Improvements - if we do not successfully manage productivity improvements, we may not realize the expected benefits.\nOur financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements as a key component of our business strategy to, among other things, contain operating expenses, increase operating efficiencies and align manufacturing capacity to demand. We may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully execute these plans while continuing to invest in business growth. Difficulties could be encountered or such cost savings may not otherwise be realized.\nBusiness Disruption - unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including a terrorist attack, war or civil unrest, a weather event, an earthquake, pandemic or other catastrophe in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such event could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our headquarters, manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to customers and disruption of information systems. This could result in a prolonged disruption to our operations. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all costs that may arise from such events. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer needs or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory.\nInternal Controls - if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent material fraud, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting, including controls within the information technology environment, is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies from occurring, which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to decline or have other potential adverse consequences.\nBREXIT - the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to end its membership in the European Union could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the UK elected to withdraw from the European Union (EU) in a national referendum (BREXIT). Additionally, the results of the United Kingdom\u2019s BREXIT has caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be higher tariffs or greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and the EU and increased regulatory complexities. The effects of BREXIT will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or on a permanent basis. These measures could potentially disrupt our supply chain, access to human capital and some of our target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate, and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, BREXIT could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to emissions and similar certifications granted to us by the EU, as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.", "PERMNO": 61313, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "DCI"}
