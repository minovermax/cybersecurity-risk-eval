{"cik": "837173", "company": "Walter Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to general risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we may deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Current Continuing Operations\nUnfavorable global economic, financial and business conditions may adversely affect our businesses.\nThe global financial markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption over the last several years. These markets have experienced, among other things, volatility in security prices, commodities and currencies, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades and declining valuations of certain investments. Weaknesses in global economic conditions have had an adverse effect and could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our coal, coke and natural gas products and on our sales, pricing and profitability. We are not able to predict whether the global economic conditions will continue, worsen or the impact that these events may have on our operations and the industry in general.\nOur businesses may suffer as a result of a substantial or extended decline in pricing, demand and other factors beyond our control, which could negatively affect our operating results and cash flows.\nOur businesses are cyclical and have experienced significant difficulties in the past. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the international and domestic markets that we serve, which fluctuate in response to various factors beyond our control. The prices at which we sell our coal, coke and natural gas are largely dependent on prevailing market prices for those products. We have experienced significant price fluctuations in our coal, coke and natural gas businesses, and we expect that such fluctuations will continue. Demand for, and therefore the price of, coal, coke and natural gas are driven by a variety of factors, including, but not limited, to the following:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply and demand for coal;\n\u2022\nthe quantity and quality of coal available from competitors;\n\u2022\nadverse weather, climatic and other natural conditions, including natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign economic conditions, including economic slowdowns;\n\u2022\nglobal and regional political events;\n\u2022\nlegislative, regulatory and judicial developments, environmental regulatory changes and changes in energy policy and energy conservation measures that could adversely affect the coal industry, such as legislation limiting carbon emissions or providing for increased funding and incentives for the use of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\ncapacity, reliability, availability and cost of transportation and port facilities, and the proximity of available coal to such transportation and port facilities; and\n\u2022\nmarket price fluctuations for emission allowances.\nIn addition, reductions in the demand for metallurgical coal caused by reduced steel production by our customers, increases in the use of substitutes for steel (such as aluminum, composites or plastics) and the use of steel-making technologies that use less or no metallurgical coal can significantly affect our financial results and impede growth. Demand for thermal coal is primarily driven by the price of thermal coal as it compares to that of natural gas and the consumption patterns of the domestic electric power generation industry, which in turn is influenced by demand for electricity and technological developments. We estimate that a 10% decrease in the price of metallurgical coal for the full year 2014 would have resulted in an increase in our pre-tax loss by $111.5 million.\nThe failure of our customers to honor or renew contracts could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of the sales of our coal, coke and natural gas are to long-term customers. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and solicit new customers. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality and price of our products, our ability to market these products effectively, our ability to deliver on a timely basis and the level of competition that we face. If current customers do not honor current contract commitments, or if they terminate agreements or exercise force majeure provisions allowing for the temporary suspension of performance, our revenues will be adversely affected. If we are\nunsuccessful in renewing contracts with our long-term customers and they discontinue purchasing coal, coke or natural gas from us or renew contracts on terms less favorable than in the past, or if we are unable to sell our coal, coke or natural gas to new customers on terms favorable to us, our revenues could suffer significantly.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal, coke and natural gas sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. If we determine that a customer is not creditworthy, we may not be required to deliver coal, coke or natural gas sold under the customer's sales contract. If this occurs, we may decide to sell the customer's coal, coke or natural gas on the spot market, which may be at prices lower than the contracted price, or we may be unable to sell the coal, coke or natural gas at all. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of any of our customers could materially and adversely affect our financial position. In addition, competition with other coal, coke or natural gas suppliers could cause us to extend credit to customers on terms that could increase the risk of payment default.\nCoal mining is subject to inherent risks and is dependent upon many factors and conditions beyond our control, which may cause our profitability and our financial position to decline.\nCoal mining is subject to inherent risks and is dependent upon a number of conditions beyond our control that can affect our costs and production schedules at particular mines. These risks and conditions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nvariations in geological conditions, such as the thickness of the coal seam and amount of rock embedded in the coal deposit and variations in rock and other natural materials overlying the coal deposit;\n\u2022\nmining, process and equipment or mechanical failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy rains or snow, flooding and other natural events affecting the operations, transportation or customers;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as subsidence and excess water ingress;\n\u2022\ndelays and difficulties in acquiring, maintaining or renewing necessary permits or mining rights;\n\u2022\navailability of adequate skilled employees and other labor relations matters;\n\u2022\nunexpected mine accidents, including rock-falls and explosions caused by the ignition of coal dust, natural gas or other explosive sources at our mine sites or fires caused by the spontaneous combustion of coal or similar mining accidents; and\n\u2022\ncompetition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas, such as coalbed methane extraction or oil and gas development.\nThese risks and conditions could result in damage to or the destruction of our mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in mining, monetary losses and legal liability. For example, an explosion and fire occurred in our Alabama underground No. 5 Mine in September 2001. This accident resulted in the deaths of thirteen employees and caused extensive damage to the mine. Our insurance coverage may not be available or sufficient to fully cover claims that may arise from these risks and conditions.\nWe have also experienced adverse geological conditions in our mines, such as variations in coal seam thickness, variations in the competency and make-up of the roof strata, fault-related discontinuities in the coal seam and the potential for ingress of excessive amounts of methane gas or water. We are not able to quickly increase production at one mine to offset an interruption in production at another mine. Such adverse conditions may increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability, and may cause us to decide to close a mine. Any of these risks or conditions could have a negative impact on our profitability, the cash available from our operations or our financial position.\nDefects in title of any real property or leasehold interests in our properties or associated coal and gas reserves could limit our ability to mine or develop these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nOur right to mine some of our coal reserves and extract natural gas may be materially adversely affected by defects in title or boundaries. We may not adequately verify title to our leased properties or associated coal or gas reserves until we have committed to developing those properties or coal or gas reserves. We may not commit to developing property or coal or gas reserves until we have obtained necessary permits and completed exploration. Any challenge to our title could delay the development of the property and could ultimately result in the loss of some or all of our interest in the property or coal or gas reserves and could increase our costs. In addition, if we mine or conduct our natural gas operations on property that we do not\nown or lease, we could incur liability for such mining and gas operations. Some leases have minimum production requirements or require us to commence mining or gas operations in a specified term to retain the lease. Failure to meet those requirements could result in losses of prepaid royalties and, in some rare cases, could result in a loss of the lease itself.\nCurrently we have significant mining operations located predominately in central Alabama and northeast British Columbia, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having our production concentrated in two geographic areas.\nOur mining operations are primarily geographically concentrated in central Alabama and Northeast British Columbia. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions in production caused by significant governmental regulation, transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, extreme weather conditions, natural disasters or interruption of transportation or other events that impact these areas. Our Northeast British Columbia operations were idled in 2014. We will continue to operate the preparation plant at the Willow Creek mine to complete processing of coal inventory that has already been mined.\nA significant reduction of, or loss of, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our profitability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we derived approximately 29% of our total sales revenues from sales to our five largest customers. We expect to renew, extend or enter into new supply agreements with these and other customers; however, we may be unsuccessful in obtaining such agreements with these customers and these customers may discontinue purchasing coal from us. If any of our major customers were to significantly reduce the quantities of coal they purchase from us and we are unable to replace these customers with new customers, or if we are otherwise unable to sell coal to those customers or on terms favorable to us, our profitability could suffer significantly.\nIf transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our customers, our ability to sell coal could suffer.\nTransportation costs can represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal to be delivered to the customer and, as a result, overall price increases in our transportation costs could make our coal less competitive with the same or alternative products from competitors with lower transportation costs. We typically depend upon overland conveyor, trucks, rail or barges to transport our products. Disruption of any of these transportation services due to weather related problems, which are variable and unpredictable; strikes or lock-outs; accidents; transportation delays or other events could impair our ability to supply our products to our customers, thereby resulting in lost sales and reduced profitability.\nAll of our U.S. metallurgical mines are served by only one rail carrier, which increases our vulnerability to these risks, although our access to barge transportation partially mitigates that risk. In addition, the majority of the metallurgical coal produced by our Alabama underground mining operations is sold to coal customers who typically arrange and pay for transportation through the state-run docks at the Port of Mobile, Alabama to the point of use. As a result, disruption at the docks, port congestion and delayed coal shipments may result in demurrage fees to us. If this disruption were to persist over an extended period of time, demurrage costs could significantly impact our profits. In addition, there are limited cost effective alternatives to the port. Similar to the U.S. operations, substantially all of the coal produced by our Canadian operations is exported to port facilities by one railway for which there are limited alternatives. Additionally, all of our Canadian export sales are loaded through one port facility, for which there are limited cost-effective alternatives. The cost of securing additional facilities and services of this nature could significantly increase transportation and other costs. An interruption of rail or port services could significantly limit our ability to operate and, to the extent that alternate sources of port and rail services are available, could increase transportation and port costs significantly. Further, the inconsistent nature of the shipping industry could affect our revenues as a result of delays of ocean vessels and could significantly affect our costs and relative competitiveness compared to the supply of coal and other products from our competitors.\nSignificant competition and foreign currency fluctuations could harm our sales, profitability and cash flows.\nThe consolidation of the coal industry over the last several years has contributed to increased competition among coal producers. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. This competition may affect domestic and foreign coal supply and associated prices and impact our ability to retain or attract coal customers. In addition, our metallurgical coal business faces competition from foreign producers that sell their coal in the export market. The general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in currency exchange rates are factors outside of our control that may affect international coal prices. If our competitors' currencies decline against our local currency or against our customers' currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices to our customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, which our sales contracts are based on, those customers may seek decreased prices for the coal that we sell to them. In addition, these factors may negatively impact our collection of trade receivables from our customers. These factors could reduce our profitability or result in lower coal sales.\nExpenses from our Canadian operations are typically incurred and paid in Canadian dollars and our United Kingdom operations revenues and expenses are incurred and paid in British pounds. We have elected not to adopt a formal foreign\ncurrency hedging strategy and as a result any significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our financial position and operating results.\nOur businesses are subject to risk of cost increases and fluctuations and delay in the delivery of raw materials, mining equipment and purchased components.\nOur businesses require significant amounts of raw materials, mining equipment and labor. As a result, shortages or increased costs of raw materials, mining equipment and labor could adversely affect our business or results of operations. Our coal mining operations rely on the availability of steel, petroleum products and other raw materials for use in various mining operations. The availability and market prices of these materials are influenced by various factors that are beyond our control. Over the last year petroleum prices have fluctuated significantly and pricing for steel scrap has fluctuated markedly. Any inability to secure a reliable supply of these materials or shortages in raw materials used in the operation and manufacturing of mining equipment or replacement parts could negatively impact our operating results.\nWork stoppages, labor shortages and other labor relations matters may harm our business.\nThe majority of employees of our underground mining operations in Alabama are represented by the United Mine Workers of America (\"UMWA\"). Normally, our negotiations with the UMWA follow the national contract negotiated with the UMWA by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association. Our collective bargaining agreement currently in place expires on December 31, 2016. At our coking operation in Birmingham, Alabama, our employees are represented by the United Steelworkers of America, and the current contract expires on December 6, 2015. We experienced a strike at our coke facilities at the end of 2001 that lasted eight months.\nWhile our Canadian operations are currently idled, during normal operations, a majority of our employees at our Wolverine and Willow Creek mining operations in Canada are also unionized. The Wolverine employees are represented by the United Steelworkers of America, Local 1-424, and our current collective bargaining agreement with the employees for that location expires on July 31, 2015. The employees at our Willow Creek mining operations are represented by Christian Labour Association of Canada (\"CLAC\"), and although our current collective bargaining agreement with CLAC for that location expired on November 30, 2014, we are currently in negotiations.\nFuture work stoppages, labor union issues or labor disruptions at our operations, and those of key customers or service providers could impede our ability to produce and deliver our products, to receive critical equipment and supplies or to collect payment. This may increase our costs or impede our ability to operate one or more of our operations.\nWe require a skilled workforce to run our business. If we cannot hire qualified people to meet replacement or expansion needs, we may not be able to achieve planned results.\nEfficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers with mining experience and proficiency as well as qualified managers and supervisors. The demand for skilled employees sometimes causes a significant constriction of the labor supply resulting in higher labor costs. When coal producers compete for skilled miners, recruiting challenges can occur and employee turnover rates can increase, which negatively affect operating efficiency and costs. If a shortage of skilled workers exists and we are unable to train and retain the necessary number of miners, it could adversely affect our productivity, costs and ability to expand production.\nWe have reclamation and mine closure obligations. If the assumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nThe SMCRA and counterpart state laws and regulations in the United States; the Mines Act and the Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia, Canada; and the Environmental Protection Act 1990, Environment Act 1995, Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 and Town and Country Planning Act 1990 in the U.K. have established operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. We accrue for reclamation costs associated with final mine closure. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our experience for similar activities. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated timing and amounts of future retirement costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates and the assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates. Furthermore, these obligations are unfunded. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2014, we had accrued $112.3 million for all our asset retirement obligations.\nInaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues or higher than expected costs.\nOur future performance depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our estimates of our proven and probable coal reserves. Reserve estimates are based on a number of sources of information, including engineering, geological, mining and property control maps, our operational experience of historical production from similar areas with similar conditions and assumptions governing future pricing and operational costs. We update our estimates of the quantity and quality of proven and probable coal reserves at least annually to reflect the production of coal from the reserves, updated geological models and mining recovery data, the tonnage contained in new lease areas acquired and estimated costs of production and sales prices. There are numerous factors and assumptions inherent in estimating coal quantities, qualities and costs to mine, including many factors beyond our control such as the following:\n\u2022\nquality of the coal;\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine;\n\u2022\nthe percentage of coal ultimately recoverable;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits, taxes, including severage and excise taxes and royalties, and other payments to governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning the timing of the development of the reserves; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning the equipment and operational productivity, future coal prices, operating costs, including for critical supplies such as fuel, tires and explosives, capital expenditures and development and reclamation costs.\nAs a result, estimates of the quantities and qualities of economically recoverable coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, estimated cost of production, and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary materially due to changes in the above factors and assumptions. Actual production recovered from identified reserve areas and properties, and revenues and expenditures associated with our mining operations may vary materially from estimates. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues and/or higher than expected costs.\nOur inability to develop coal reserves in an economically feasible manner or our inability to acquire additional coal reserves may adversely affect our business.\nOur long-term profitability depends in part on our ability to cost effectively mine and process coal reserves that possess the quality characteristics desired by our customers. As we mine, our coal reserves decline. As a result, our future success depends upon our ability to develop or acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable. We may not be able to obtain adequate economically recoverable replacement reserves when we require them. If available, replacement reserves may not be available at favorable prices or we may not be capable of mining those reserves at costs that are comparable with our existing coal reserves.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to accurately assess the geological characteristics of reserves that we now own or subsequently acquire, which may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. Exhaustion of reserves at particular mines also may have an adverse effect on our operating results that is disproportionate to the percentage of overall production represented by those mines. Our ability to acquire other reserves in the future could be limited by, our financial position, restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements, competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates available on commercially reasonable terms, among other factors. If we are unable to replace or increase our coal reserves on acceptable terms, our production and revenues will decline as our reserves are depleted and our future profits will be detrimentally impacted.\nCanadian licenses, permits and other authorizations may be subject to challenges based on Aboriginal or Treaty rights.\nCanadian judicial decisions have recognized the continued existence of Aboriginal and Treaty rights in Canada, including title to lands continuously used or occupied by Aboriginal groups. Our Northeast British Columbia operations are located within Treaty 8 territory, to which nine First Nations in British Columbia are signatories. Current operations are in or near the traditional territories of the West Moberly, Saulteau and Halfway River First Nations, and the McLeod Lake Indian Band. The Province of British Columbia has signed an Economic Benefits Agreement and related land and resource use agreements with several of the First Nations, including the West Moberly First Nation, over the last few years. The Treaty 8, as well as the\nEconomic Benefits Agreement and related agreements, establish First Nations rights and define roles for their involvement in land and resource use. As a means of protecting Treaty and Aboriginal rights, as well as undetermined aboriginal rights, Canadian courts continue to confirm a duty to consult with Aboriginal groups when the Crown has knowledge of existing rights or the potential existence of an Aboriginal right, such as title or hunting rights, and contemplates conduct that might adversely impact such First Nations rights. As issues relating to Aboriginal and Treaty rights and consultation continue to be heard, developed and resolved in Canadian courts, we will continue to cooperate, communicate and exchange information and views with Aboriginal groups and government, and participate with the Crown in its consultation processes with Aboriginal groups in order to foster good relationships and minimize risks to our mineral rights and operational plans. Due to their complexity, it is not expected that the issues regarding Aboriginal and Treaty rights or consultation will be finally resolved in the short term and, accordingly, the impact of these issues on mineral resources and on our mining operations is unknown at this time. We believe in building mutually beneficial and lasting relationships with local First Nations whose Treaty rights or potential Aboriginal rights overlap with our areas of operations. We are in the process of further formalizing our relationships with local First Nations through agreements that generally seek to increase First Nations' participation in our planning and operational activities. Should a dispute arise between the First Nations and the Crown, it could significantly restrict our ability to operate and transport coal within the region. Also, such action could have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as on our customers.\nFailure to meet our project development and expansion targets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to manage an expansion of our operations effectively or that our current personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations. Any failure of management to effectively manage our growth and development could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur targets are subject to the completion of planned operational goals on time and within budget, and are dependent on the effective support from our personnel, systems, procedures and controls. Any failure of these may result in delays in the achievement of operational targets with a consequent material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial performance.\nOur operations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to risks and uncertainties that may have a negative impact on our profitability.\nWe operate and sell to customers in a number of foreign countries where there are added risks and uncertainties due to the different economic, cultural and political environments. We face risks in securing additional property licenses, as the process for obtaining these is likely to be different from that in the U.S. Such risks could result in failed attempts to obtain licenses that would have consumed management time and financial resources. We also face risks from trade barriers, exchange controls and material changes in taxation which could negatively impact our ability to sell into foreign markets, as well as our profitability.\nExtensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations impose significant costs on our operations and future regulations could increase those costs, limit our ability to produce or adversely affect the demand for our products.\nOur businesses are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations with respect to matters such as:\n\u2022\npermitting and licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nemployee health and safety, including:\n\u2022\noccupational safety and health;\n\u2022\nmine health and safety;\n\u2022\nworkers' compensation;\n\u2022\nblack lung;\n\u2022\nreclamation and restoration of property;\n\u2022\nenvironmental laws and regulations, including:\n\u2022\ngreenhouse gases and climate change;\n\u2022\nair quality standards;\n\u2022\nwater quality standards;\n\u2022\nmanagement of materials generated by mining and coking operations;\n\u2022\nthe storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u2022\nremediation of contaminated soil and groundwater; and\n\u2022\nprotection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered species, and emergency planning and community right to know.\nCompliance with these regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or interrupt continuation of exploration or production at one or more of our operations. These laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for these laws have not yet been promulgated and in certain instances are undergoing revision. These laws and regulations, particularly new legislative or administrative proposals (or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations), could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or our customers' ability to use our products. In addition, the coal industry in the U.S. is affected by significant legislation mandating certain benefits for current and retired coal miners.\nWe strive to conduct our mining, natural gas and coke operations in compliance with all applicable federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations. However, due in part to the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, along with changing interpretations of these requirements, violations occur from time to time in our industry and at our operations. In recent years, expenditures at our U.S. operations for regulatory or environmental obligations have been mainly for safety or process changes. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of these rule-making and standard-setting efforts, it is possible that the magnitude of these changes will require an unprecedented compliance effort on our part, could divert management's attention, and may require significant expenditures. To the extent that these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be detrimentally impacted. We believe that our major North American competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus do not believe that our relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations. However, the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, which is a major cost consideration for our operations, may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to foreign producers and operators who may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations. In addition, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, applicable state or provincial legislation and its production methods.\nFederal, state, local or provincial regulatory agencies have the authority to order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' demands.\nFederal, state, local or provincial regulatory agencies have the authority under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this occurred, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our mines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices, which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts; however, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if available, to fulfill these obligations or incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments, and the extension of time for delivery or terminate customers' contracts. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIncreased focus by regulatory authorities on the effects of coal mining on the environment and recent regulatory developments related to coal mining operations could make it more difficult or increase our costs to receive new permits or to comply with our existing permits to mine coal or otherwise adversely affect us.\nRegulatory agencies are increasingly focused on the effects of coal mining on the environment, particularly relating to water quality, which has resulted in more rigorous permitting requirements and enforcement efforts.\nSection 404 of the CWA requires mining companies to obtain USACE permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities. As is the case with other coal mining companies, our construction and mining activities require Section 404 permits. The issuance of permits to construct valley fills and refuse impoundments under Section 404 of the CWA has been the subject of many court cases and\nincreased regulatory oversight, resulting in additional permitting requirements that are expected to delay or even prevent the opening of new mines. Stringent water quality standards for materials such as selenium have recently been issued. We have begun to incorporate these new requirements into our current permit applications; however, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to meet these or any other new standards with respect to our permit applications.\nIn April 2010, the EPA issued comprehensive guidance to provide clarification as to the water quality standards that should apply when reviewing CWA permit applications for Appalachian surface coal mining operations. This guidance establishes threshold conductivity levels to be used as a basis for evaluating compliance with narrative water quality standards. To obtain necessary permits, we and other mining companies are required to meet these requirements. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the EPA overstepped its statutory authority under the CWA and SMCRA, and infringed on the authority reserved to state regulators under those statutes when it issued the guidance. The EPA appealed the decision and the D.C. Circuit Court reversed the ruling and upheld the EPA's guidance document relating to such permits, against challenges from the mining industry and two states.\nAdditionally, in January 2011, the EPA rescinded a federal CWA permit held by another coal mining company for a surface mine in Appalachia citing associated environmental damage and degradation. While our operations are not directly impacted, this could be an indication that other surface mining water permits could be subject to more substantial review in the future. A federal judge reversed the decision by the EPA to revoke the permit and the EPA appealed the decision. On April 23, 2013, the D.C. Circuit ruled that the EPA has the power under the CWA to retroactively veto a section 404 dredge and fill permit \"whenever\" it makes a determination about certain adverse effects, even years after the USACE has granted the permit to an applicant. The owner of the coal mine, coal industry groups and others, including several states petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review and reverse the ruling; on March 24, 2014, the Court denied the petitions for review. In September 2014, the D.C. District Court ruled again in the EPA\u2019s favor and the coal mining company has appealed the decision.\nOn March 25, 2014, the EPA and the USACE jointly proposed a rule defining the scope of waters protected under the CWA. The proposal would revise regulations that have been in place for more than 25 years. Revisions are proposed in light of 2001 and 2006 Supreme Court rulings that interpreted the regulatory scope of the CWA more narrowly than previously, but created uncertainty about the precise effect of the Court\u2019s decisions. The public comment period for the proposed rule closed November 14, 2014. The EPA projects that a final rule will be promulgated in April 2015.\nIt is unknown what future changes will be implemented to the permitting review and issuance process or to other aspects of mining operations, but the increased regulatory focus, future laws and judicial decisions and any other future changes could materially and adversely affect all coal mining companies.\nRegulatory agencies in Canada are also increasingly focused on the effects of coal mining on the environment, particularly as it relates to water quality and to wildlife habitat. The British Columbia Ministry of Environment updated its selenium guidelines in 2014, which could affect water quality issues and effluent discharge standards. Expansion of existing coal mines and development of new coal mines in northeast British Columbia have also been the focus of consideration with respect to the effects on caribou habitat, particularly in areas where caribou have been identified as a threatened species under the federal Species at Risk Act. It is unknown what future changes will be implemented to the permitting review and issuance process or to other aspects of surface mining operations in British Columbia, but the increased regulatory focus, future laws and judicial decisions and any other future changes could materially and adversely affect all coal mining companies operating in British Columbia, including us.\nIn particular, in each jurisdiction in which we operate, we will incur additional permitting and operating costs, could be unable to obtain new permits or maintain existing permits and could incur fines, penalties and other costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. If surface coal mining methods are limited or prohibited, it could significantly increase our operational costs and make it more difficult to economically recover a significant portion of our reserves. In the event that we cannot increase the price we charge for coal to cover the higher production costs without reducing customer demand for our coal, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased public focus on the environmental, health and aesthetic impacts of surface coal mining could harm our reputation and reduce demand for coal.\nClimate change concerns could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe combustion of fossil fuels, such as the coal, coke and natural gas that we produce results in the creation of carbon dioxide that is currently emitted into the atmosphere by end-users. Further, some of our operations emit GHGs directly, such as methane release resulting from coal mining and carbon dioxide during our coke production. Carbon dioxide is considered a GHGs and is a major source of concern with respect to global warming, also known as climate change. Climate change continues to attract public and scientific attention and increasing government attention is being paid to reducing GHG emissions.\nThere are many legal and regulatory approaches currently in effect or being considered to address GHGs, including possible future U.S. treaty commitments, new federal or state legislation that may impose a carbon emissions tax or establish a \"cap and trade\" program, and regulation by the U.S. EPA.\nThe U.S. EPA, under President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan, has been working on an approach to cut carbon pollution from power plants. In 2013, the EPA proposed standards to limit carbon pollution from new power plants. In 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan to limit carbon pollution from existing power plants as well as proposed standards to limit carbon pollution from modified and reconstructed power plants. The EPA plans to issue final rules on these standards in 2015. A major coal company, joined by Attorneys General from nine states filed a complaint asking the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the EPA from proceeding with the proposal. Twelve state Attorneys General filed another suit in the D.C. Circuit, arguing that the EPA\u2019s proposed rules are the result of an allegedly illegal settlement with environmental groups in 2010.\nIn November 2014, the U.S. and China announced a bilateral agreement to reduce GHG emissions. The U.S. agreed to reduce GHGs by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. China pledged to stabilize its GHG emissions by 2030, to be accomplished in part by increasing its percentage of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind to 20% of the nation's total energy production.\nCanadian legal and regulatory approaches include both federal and provincial regulations requiring the reporting of GHG emissions. Both the federal and provincial level governments are considering the implementation of GHG regulatory structures such as a \"cap and trade\" program and emissions trading. These programs could force reductions in total GHG emissions on an industry or facility basis. In British Columbia, the government imposes a carbon emissions tax with scheduled increases.\nThese existing laws and regulations or other current and future efforts to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions, could adversely impact the demand for, price of and value of our products and reserves. Passage of additional state, provincial, federal or foreign laws or regulations regarding GHG emissions or other actions to limit GHG emissions could result in users switching from coal to other alternative clean fuel substitutes. The anticipation of such additional requirements could also lead to reduced demand for some of our products. Alternative clean fuels, including non-fossil fuels, could become more attractive than coal in order to reduce GHG emissions, which could result in a reduction in the demand for coal, and therefore our revenues. As our operations also emit GHGs directly, current or future laws or regulations limiting GHG emissions could increase our own costs. Although the potential impacts on us of additional climate change regulation are difficult to reliably quantify, they could be material.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate hazardous wastes from time to time. We could become subject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and cleanup of soil, surface water, groundwater and other media. Such claims may arise, for example, out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or may acquire. Our liability for such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire amount of damages assessed.\nWe maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at our mining complexes. Such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. Slurry impoundments have been known to fail, releasing large volumes of coal slurry into the surrounding environment. Structural failure of an impoundment can result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as create liability for related personal injuries, property damages and injuries to wildlife. Some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and the assessment of damages arising out of such failure. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for related fines and penalties.\nDrainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a condition referred to as \"acid mine drainage\" (\"AMD\"). Treatment of AMD can be costly. Although we do not currently face material costs associated with AMD, it is possible that we could incur significant costs in the future.\nThese and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect us.\nSee also \"Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters\" in \"Item 1 - Business\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Business Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had indebtedness of approximately $978.2 million outstanding under a $2.7 billion credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\"), $970.0 million of 9.50% senior secured notes due 2019, $388.0 million of 9.875% senior notes due 2020, $450.0 million of 8.50% senior notes due 2021 and $350.0 million 11.0%/12.0% senior secured PIK toggle notes due 2020 (together referred to as the \"Notes\"). Under the repayment schedule relating to the Credit Agreement, we will not be required to make mandatory principal payments until 2018. In addition, the excess cash flow provision, as defined in the Credit Agreement, will be applied if certain conditions are met, requiring us to reduce the principal balance of the indebtedness. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings, or other financing may be unavailable in a sufficient amount, to enable us to fund our future financial obligations or our other liquidity needs.\nOur substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to borrow money in the future and may reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities and may have other detrimental consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, which will reduce funds available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth for areas such as working capital and capital expenditure needs, or our ability to meet debt service requirements or other cash requirements;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest costs if the underlying interest rates rise on our existing credit facility or other variable rate debt;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit or other financing, particularly during periods in which credit markets are weak;\n\u2022\ncausing a decline in our credit ratings;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to acquire new coal reserves and/or plant and equipment needed to conduct operations; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we compete and general economic and market conditions.\nIf we further increase our indebtedness, the related risks that we now face, including those described above, could intensify.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt. For additional information on the covenants under our Credit Agreement, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations-Analysis of Material Covenants.\"\nOur ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to service our debt and financial obligations, to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. We are subject to general economic, climatic, industry, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In particular, economic conditions have caused the price of coal to fall and our revenue to decline and in the future could cause the price of coal to remain at current levels or fall, which may have an adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, ability to remain in compliance with our covenants in our Credit Agreement, and our ability to service our indebtedness. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Our ability to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things:\n\u25aa\nour financial condition at the time;\n\u25aa\nrestrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness; and\n\u25aa\nother factors, including conditions in the financial and capital markets or coal industry.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise capital from debt or equity financings to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. Additionally, we may not be able to consummate such dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nIn addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the Notes or other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due to our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect to our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flows, and additional borrowings or refinancing are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt or are not in compliance with our covenants and are not able to amend those covenants, we will be in default and holders of the Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Credit Agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may need to seek an amendment to our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our Notes to prevent us from potentially being in breach of our covenants.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nRestrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to respond to changing conditions.\nThe Credit Agreement, the indentures governing the Notes, and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain a number of significant covenants in addition to covenants restricting the incurrence of additional debt. These covenants limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\npay certain dividends or distributions on our capital stock or to repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens on our assets to secure debt;\n\u2022\nmerge or to enter into other business combination transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\ntransfer and sell assets.\nOur Credit Agreement requires us, among other things, to maintain certain financial ratios. These restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain future financings, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement and the indentures governing the Notes impose on us.\nA breach of any covenant in the Credit Agreement, the indentures governing the Notes, or the agreements governing our other indebtedness would result in a default under that agreement after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under the agreement and in a default with respect to, and acceleration of, the debt outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nA \"change in control\" under the Credit Agreement, which may occur as a result of events beyond our control, would result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nA \"change in control\" as defined in our Credit Agreement is considered an event of default and is deemed to occur when any person or group beneficially owns 35% or more of our common stock or where our Board of Directors ceases to consist of a majority of continuing directors. Upon a change in control, the lenders could elect to declare due and payable immediately all amounts due, including principal and accrued interest. We may be unable to prevent a change in control from occurring at a time when we are unable to repay or refinance such indebtedness and the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, a change of control under our Credit Agreement could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.\nChanges in our credit ratings could adversely affect our costs and expenses.\nAny downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms, including increased borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants. This could affect our internal cost of capital estimates and therefore impact operational and investment decisions.\nFailure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations and, therefore, our ability to mine or lease coal.\nFederal, state and provincial laws require us to obtain surety bonds or post other financial security to secure performance or payment of certain long-term obligations, such as mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers' compensation costs, coal leases and other obligations. We may have difficulty procuring or maintaining our surety bonds. Our bond issuers may demand higher fees or additional collateral, including letters of credit or other terms less favorable to us upon those renewals. Because we are required by state and federal law to have these bonds in place before mining can commence or continue, our failure to maintain surety bonds, letters of credit or other guarantees or security arrangements would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal. That failure could result from a variety of factors, including lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms, the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety and restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our financing arrangements.\nOur expenditures for pensions and benefits, including postretirement benefits, are significant and could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nWe provide a range of benefits to our employees and retirees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2014, we estimated that our pension plans' aggregate projected benefit obligation had a present value of approximately $316.5 million, and the fair value of plan assets was approximately $244.6 million. As of December 31, 2014, we estimated that our postretirement health care and life insurance plans' aggregate projected benefit obligation had a present value of approximately $598.4 million and such benefits are not required to be funded. With respect to the funding obligations for our pension plans, we must make minimum cash contributions on a quarterly basis. Weakening of the economic environment and uncertainty in the equity markets may cause investment income and the values of investment assets held in our pension trust to decline and to lose value. As a result, in such circumstances we may be required to increase the amount of cash contributions we make into the pension trust in the future in order to meet the funding level requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Pension Act). We do not have a required minimum funding requirement in fiscal year 2015. We have estimated these obligations based on assumptions described under the heading \"Critical Accounting Estimates-Employee Benefits\" in Part II, \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,\" and in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Assumed health care cost trend rates, discount rates, expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and health care plans. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits.\nBeginning in 2018, the 2010 healthcare legislation as currently written will impose a 40% excise tax on employers to the extent that the value of their healthcare plan coverage exceeds certain dollar thresholds. We anticipate that certain government agencies will provide additional regulations or interpretations concerning the application of this excise tax. Until these regulations or interpretations are published, it is impractical to reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of the excise tax on our future healthcare costs or postretirement benefit obligations. We have incorporated changes to our actuarial assumptions to determine our postretirement benefit obligations utilizing preliminary estimates and basic assumptions around the pending interpretations of these regulations.\nIn addition, certain of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension and healthcare plan trusts established for represented employees. Contributions to these funds could increase as a result of future collective bargaining with the UMWA , a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency of other coal companies who currently contribute to these funds, failure of the plans to meet the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") minimum funding requirements, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, actions taken by, or other funding deficiencies.\nWe face risks and uncertainties by participating in the 1974 UMWA Pension Plan (\"the 1974 Pension Plan\"). All assets contributed to the plan are pooled and available to provide benefits for all participants and beneficiaries. As a result, contributions made by our subsidiaries benefit the employees of other employers. If the 1974 Pension Plan fails to meet ERISA's minimum funding requirements or fails to develop and adopt a rehabilitation plan, a nondeductible excise tax of five percent of the accumulated funding deficiency may be imposed on an employer's contribution to this multi-employer pension plan. As a result of the 1974 Pension Plan entering \"critical\" status, the Pensions Act requires a surcharge of 5% of the contributions otherwise required under the current collective bargaining agreement be contributed which will increase the contribution rate. Subject to certain exceptions, the surcharge will increase to 10% per hour on July 1, 2015. Additionally as a result of the 1974 Pension Plan's \"critical\" status, Federal law requires pension plans to adopt a rehabilitation plan aimed at restoring the financial health of the plan. The law permits pension plans to reduce, or even eliminate, benefits called \"adjustable benefits\" as part of a rehabilitation plan.\nUnder current law governing multi-employer defined benefit plans, if we withdrew from the 1974 Pension Plan or if the plan trustees were to terminate the plan, the currently underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan which would approximate the proportionate share of the multiemployer plan's unfunded vested benefit liabilities at the time of the withdrawal.\nWe have no current intention to withdraw from any multiemployer pension plan, but if we were to do so, under the ERISA , as amended, we would be liable for a proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefit liabilities upon our withdrawal. Through June 30, 2014, our estimated withdrawal liability for the multiemployer pension plans amounted to $661.2 million.\nWe are responsible for portions of our workers' compensation and certain medical and disability benefits, and greater than expected claims could reduce our profitability.\nWe are responsible for portions of our workers' compensation benefits for work-related injuries. Workers' compensation liabilities, including those related to claims incurred but not reported, are recorded principally using annual valuations based on discounted future expected payments using historical data of the specific subsidiary or combined insurance industry data when historical data is limited. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are responsible for medical and disability benefits for black lung disease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended, and are self-insured for portions of this liability against black lung related claims. We perform periodic evaluations of our black lung liability, using assumptions regarding rates of successful claims, discount factors, benefit increases and mortality rates, among others. See additional information under the heading \"Critical Accounting Estimates-Employee Benefits\" in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results could be reduced.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a particular period, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future. In addition, such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings, see Part I, \"Note 10-Income Taxes\" and \"Note 16-Commitments and Contingencies\" to the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur executive officers and other key personnel are important to our success and the loss of one or more of these individuals could harm our business.\nOur executive officers and other key personnel have significant experience in the businesses in which we operate and the loss of certain of these individuals could harm our business. Although we have been successful in attracting qualified individuals for key management and corporate positions in the past, as our business develops and in the current challenging environment, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future. The loss of key management personnel could harm our ability to successfully manage our business functions, prevent us from executing our business strategy and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nOur share price has and is likely to fluctuate in the future because of the volatility of the stock market in general and a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral global economic conditions that impact infrastructure activity, including interest rate and currency movements and the effect this could have on commodity prices for our products;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in actual or anticipated results of our operations;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactions or announcements by our competitors or customers;\n\u2022\nactions by our principal stockholders;\n\u2022\ntrading volumes of our common stock;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nU.S. and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nloss or gain of a major customer;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of our common stock.\nMarket fluctuations have and could continue to result in extreme volatility in the share price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our stock. Price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of shares of our common stock is low. In addition, if our operating results and net income fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors, we may experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock.\nIf we cannot meet the New York Stock Exchange continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In the future, if we are not be able to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, which require, among other things, that the average closing price of our common stock not fall below $1.00 over 30 consecutive trading days, we would fall below compliance standards and could risk having our common stock delisted if the Company is not able to regain compliance.\nA delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock; and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by our current financial condition, our holding company structure, the covenants in our debt instruments and applicable provisions of Delaware law.\nOn January 27, 2015, our Board of Directors suspended the quarterly dividend to stockholders and may, in its discretion discontinue the payment of dividends for the foreseeable future. If we were to decide in the future to pay dividends, our ability to do so will be dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings and cash flows and distribute them to us so that we may fund our obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us will be subject to our and their respective operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, the applicable laws of the State of Delaware (which may limit the amount of funds available for distribution), compliance with covenants and required financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness and other agreements with third parties. Furthermore, our Credit Agreement contains a restriction on our ability to pay cash dividends in any fiscal quarter when our secured leverage ratio exceeds 4.50:1.00. If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we are unable to generate sufficient distributions from our business, we may not be able to make the payment of dividends on our shares in the foreseeable future.\nTerrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the U.S. or its allies, as well as military or trade disruptions affecting our customers or the economy as a whole may materially adversely affect our operations or those of our customers. As a result, there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to our customers, decreased sales of our coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from our customers. Strategic targets such as energy-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the U.S. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. Any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to significant liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs or other risks if we sustain cyber-attacks or other security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers or other third-parties.\nWe have implemented security protocols and systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our operations and protecting our and our counterparties' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access. Despite such efforts, we may be subject to security breaches, which could result in unauthorized access to our facilities or the information that we are trying to protect. Unauthorized physical access to one of our facilities or electronic access to our information systems could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, litigation by affected parties, damage to sources of competitive advantage, disruptions to our operations, loss of customers, financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information and costs to remediate such security vulnerabilities, any of which could have a substantial impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 82540, "SIC": 1220, "TIC": "WLTGQ"}
