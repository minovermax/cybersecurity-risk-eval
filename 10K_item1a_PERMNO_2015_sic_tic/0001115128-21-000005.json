{"cik": "1115128", "company": "Quotient Technology Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial conditions, and the trading price of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only risk facing us. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred net losses since inception and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses of $65.4 million, $37.1 million and $28.3 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $450.3 million as of December 31, 2020. We anticipate that our costs and expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in:\n\u2022retailer partnerships;\n\u2022sales and marketing;\n\u2022research and development, including new product development;\n\u2022our technology infrastructure, business processes, and automation;\n\u2022general administration, including legal and accounting expenses related to our growth and continued expenses;\n\u2022expanding into new markets and verticals; and\n\u2022strategic opportunities and commercial relationships.\nFor example, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses in developing and retaining retailer partnerships and developing self-service capabilities and automation. We may not succeed in increasing our revenues sufficiently to offset these expenses.\nIf we are unable to execute our growth strategy and gain efficiencies in our operating costs, our business could be adversely impacted. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attain or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks and difficulties as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe may not achieve revenue growth.\nWe may not be able to achieve revenue growth, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability. Historically the growth rate of our business, and as a result, our revenue growth, has varied from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we expect that variability to continue. Our revenues may fluctuate due to changes in marketing budgets of CPGs and retailers and the timing of their marketing spend. Marketing spend by CPGs is considered the most flexible and easiest to cut and CPGs can change their spend without notice, which can result in our inability to anticipate such fluctuations. For example, budget pressures or unspent budgets at the end of a CPG\u2019s fiscal year may lead to respectively, unexpected reduced or increased spending on our platforms.\nDecisions by CPGs or retailers to delay or reduce their digital marketing on our platforms or choose a solution from one of our competitors, or changes in our fee arrangements with CPGs, retailers and other commercial partners, could also slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenues. For instance, beginning in mid-March of 2020, decisions by CPGs and retailers to mostly pause or delay, and in some cases cancel, marketing campaigns due to the uncertainty, supply-chain disruption, and consumer purchasing behavior changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our revenue and revenue growth for the second quarter of 2020. While CPGs and retailers resumed digital marketing in the second half of 2020 generally, certain CPGs still are experiencing supply chain disruption and as circumstances change, we may continue to see reduced digital marketing levels and postponed or cancelled campaigns, particularly if COVID-19 outbreaks worsen.\nOur business is complex and evolving. We may offer new capabilities, pricing, service models, process and delivery methods to CPGs and retailers. These new capabilities may change the way we generate and/or recognize revenue, which could impact our operating results. We announced in the first quarter of 2020 that effective second quarter of 2020, we would modify the way we process and deliver certain media products to enhance customer experience. As a result of these changes, we have recognized certain revenue on a net basis as compared to the prior recognition on a gross basis and this has caused a decrease in our revenue growth and impacted our revenues. In addition, if we shift a greater number of our arrangements with CPGs to new pricing models and we are not able to deliver on the results, our revenue growth and revenue could be negatively affected.\nWe believe that our continued revenue growth will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022increase our share of CPG spend on promotions and media (collectively, \u201cmarketing spend\u201d) through our platforms, increase the number of brands that are using our platforms within each CPG, and expand our CPG base;\n\u2022adapt to changes in marketing goals, strategies and budgets of CPGs and retailers and the timing of their marketing spend;\n\u2022maintain and grow our retailer network and expand into new verticals;\n\u2022capitalize on the shift from offline to digital marketing and growth in e-commerce;\n\u2022maintain and expand our data rights with our retailer network;\n\u2022successfully execute and expand our digital media solutions into areas such as retail performance media, social influencer marketing, sponsored product search, DOOH, and programmatic media;\n\u2022successfully execute and expand our promotions solutions into areas such as in-lane, targeted promotions, national rebates, and loyalty rewards programs;\n\u2022demonstrate the value of our platforms through trusted measurement metrics;\n\u2022maintain and grow the size of our targetable audience;\n\u2022respond to changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy and data protection, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\n\u2022deploy, execute, and continue to develop our analytics capabilities;\n\u2022expand the use by consumers of our media and promotions offerings;\n\u2022successfully integrate our newly acquired companies into our business;\n\u2022innovate our consumer solutions and experiences to retain and grow our consumer base;\n\u2022expand the number, variety, quality, and relevance of promotions available on our platforms and through our network;\n\u2022increase the awareness of our brands, and earn and build our reputation;\n\u2022hire, integrate, train and retain talented personnel;\n\u2022effectively manage scaling and international expansion of our operations; and\n\u2022successfully compete with existing and new competitors.\nHowever, we cannot assure you that we will successfully accomplish any of these actions. Failure to do so could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer.\nOur revenue and business will be negatively affected if we fail to retain and expand our relationships with retailers and obtain retailer commitment and support for our platforms.\nThe success and scale of our platforms depend on our strategic relationships with retailers and the level of retailer commitment and support for our platforms. If we do not renew, maintain and expand these relationships, or add new retailers to our platforms, our business will be negatively affected\nFor instance, our revenue and growth may be adversely impacted if retailers do not support our platforms. The success of our platforms requires integration with a retailer\u2019s POS, loyalty programs and consumer channels. Certain platform capabilities may require integration with other retailer systems as well. This integration requires time and effort from the retailer; and may require us to work with a retailer\u2019s third-party service providers, some of whom may be our competitors. In addition, the success of our platforms requires consumer and CPG adoption which requires significant marketing and other support from retailers, If retailers do not provide sufficient or timely resources and support, platform launches could be delayed and consumer and/or CPG adoption could be slow or minimal, which would negatively impact our revenue, costs of revenue, and recoverability of certain assets. For example, delays in the launch of in-lane promotions and sponsored search and display adversely impacted our revenue growth for the second half of 2019. Our revenue was negatively affected in the first half of 2020 when retailers mostly paused or delayed, and in some cases cancelled, marketing campaigns on our platforms in response to supply-chain challenges and out-of-stock product at shelf, consumer purchasing behavior changes, and other issues resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe success of our platforms also depends in part on our use of consumer sales data provided by retailers, our access to retailer\u2019s consumer channels, and the national scale and reach of our retailer network. If we fail to secure, or are found to be in violation of the terms of, such data, access and scale, we could lose access to retailer data and our platforms would be less valuable to CPGs and other business partners. If we do not renew our retailer agreements at the same level, lose a retailer, or fail to add new retailers on our platforms, our business, revenue and growth would be negatively affected.\nIn addition, we depend on retailers to comply with laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and the use of consumer data. If we and our retail partners cannot timely respond to legal, regulatory and industry changes, or if retailers decide to limit or prohibit use of their data to comply with such changes, our revenue and growth would be impaired. For instance, if the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \" CCPA\"), is amended to prohibit the \u201csale\u201d (as defined in the CCPA) of loyalty program data, or if retailers materially restrict our use of sales and loyalty card data in light of the CCPA or similar laws or regulations, our business will be negatively affected. See the risk factor below titled \u201cOur business is subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations and industry standards, and unfavorable interpretations of, or changes in, or failure by us to comply with these laws, regulations and industry standards could substantially harm our business and results of operations\u201d for additional information.\nOur sales cycle with retailers tends to be long and we may make investments and incur significant expenses before an agreement or renewal is reached, if at all, and before we are able to generate any revenue from such agreement or renewal. There are no guarantees that we will be able to recoup such investments and expenses, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss or decrease in spending of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is exposed to risks related to customer concentration, particularly among CPGs and retailers. The loss or decrease in spending of any of our significant customers or deterioration in our relationships with any of them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the distribution, revenue sharing or other fees that we pay increase or we are unable to meet contractual minimums under guaranteed distribution fee arrangements, our gross profit and business will be negatively affected.\nWe generally pay a distribution fee to retailers and publishers when we deliver media and promotions on their digital properties or through their loyalty programs. We also pay fees to retailers for use of their data to power our platforms. Such fees have increased as a percentage of our revenue in recent periods. As we renew agreements or enter into new ones, we may face pressure to pay higher distribution fees. If such fees continue to increase, our cost of revenue could increase and our operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, calculations of such fees are complex and if retailers disagree with our calculations in an audit, it could have an adverse impact on our business.\nSome of our agreements with retailers include certain prepaid or guaranteed distribution fees, which, in some cases, may apply to multiple annual periods. If the adoption and usage of our platforms do not meet projections or minimums, these prepaid or guaranteed distribution fees may not be recoverable and any shortfall may be payable by us at the end of the applicable period. We consider various factors in our assessment of whether these prepaid or guaranteed distribution fees may not be recoverable, including our historical experience with the transaction volumes through the retailer and comparative retailers, ongoing communications with the retailer to increase its marketing efforts to promote the digital platform, as well as the projected revenue, and associated revenue share payments. For example, in 2020, implementation with a retailer of one of the Company\u2019s solutions resulted in slower than expected adoption due to a variety of factors, including the spread of COVID-19 and a dispute related to the retailer's failure to perform certain obligations under the agreement. In light of these factors, we were not able to meet the contractual minimum under such arrangement at the end of the applicable period, which was originally scheduled to end in October 2020. In order to resolve a disagreement regarding the parties' respective obligations under the agreement with respect to such applicable period, we recognized a loss of $8.8 million to settle such matter. It is possible that we will not be able to meet future contractual minimums of this agreement or other agreements in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur gross margins are dependent on many factors, some of which are not directly controlled by us.\nThe factors potentially affecting our gross margins include:\n\u2022our product mix since we have significant variations in our gross margin among products. Any substantial change in product mix could change our aggregate gross margin;\n\u2022growth and expansion of our lower-margin media products, including programmatic ads delivered through third-party ad-tech partners and publishers;\n\u2022ability to meet contractual minimums under guaranteed distribution fee arrangements;\n\u2022increasing costs of maintaining, expanding and adding retailer relationships;\n\u2022increasing data and traffic acquisition costs for offsite media on third-party properties;\n\u2022evolving fee arrangements with CPGs, which might have an impact on our gross margins;\n\u2022success of our pricing strategies, including outcome-based strategies;\n\u2022success of our investments in technology and automation or through acquisitions to gain cost efficiencies;\n\u2022increasing pricing pressures from competitors, CPGs and agencies representing CPGs; and\n\u2022success of higher-margin new products.\nFor instance, we have seen pressure on our gross margins, which we principally attribute to the factors described above and we expect this pressure to continue as our growth strategy evolves and our product mix continues to change. Although we expect to gain leverage as our business expands and through automation, there is no guarantee that we will succeed.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Historically, our revenue growth has varied from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we expect that variability to continue. In addition, our operating costs and expenses have fluctuated in the past, and we anticipate that our costs and expenses will increase over time as we continue to invest in growing our business. Our operating results could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as a result of these and other factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result we have a limited ability to forecast the amount of future revenue and expenses, which may adversely affect our ability to predict financial results accurately. Our ability to forecast our future results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in changing industries. Our results of operations may fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may lead analysts to change their long-term models for valuing our common stock, cause us to face short-term liquidity issues, impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel or cause other unanticipated issues, all of which could cause our stock price and the trading price of the convertible senior notes to decline. As a result of the potential variations in our quarterly revenue and operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and the results of any one quarter or historical patterns should not be considered indicative of our future sales activity, expenditure levels or performance.\nIn addition to other factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022our ability to adapt to changes in marketing goals, strategies and budgets of CPGs and retailers and the timing of their marketing spend;\n\u2022our ability to maintain or expand our retailer network and expand into new verticals;\n\u2022our ability to maintain and expand our data rights with our retailer network;\n\u2022our ability to leverage retailer demands to increase CPG spend on retailer performance media;\n\u2022the impact of competitors or competitive products and services, and our ability to compete in digital marketing;\n\u2022the impact of pricing pressures from our competitors, CPGs and agencies representing CPGs;\n\u2022reduction in demand or volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: delay or cancellation of marketing campaigns by CPGs and retailers as they focus on manufacturing in-demand products, replenishing out-of-stock items, adjust to changes in consumer purchasing behavior, contend with supply-chain challenges, and other issues arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022disruption of planned themed marketing campaigns by CPGs and retailers, including campaigns that were adversely impacted by shelter-in-place orders and social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022reduction in overall media spend by CPGs in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, which primarily had a negative effect on our media business starting March of 2020 and into the second quarter of 2020 and despite a return of bookings in the second half of 2020, could have an adverse effect through 2021;\n\u2022our ability to grow consumer selection and use of our digital promotion offerings and attract new consumers to our platform;\n\u2022our ability to obtain and increase the number of high quality promotions;\n\u2022changes in consumer behavior with respect to digital promotions and media and how consumers access digital promotions and media and our ability to develop applications that are widely accepted and generate revenues for CPGs, retailers and us;\n\u2022our ability to control costs including the costs of obtaining consumer data and investing, maintaining and enhancing our technology infrastructure;\n\u2022increased legal and compliance costs associated with data protection laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, including the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, and invalidation of the EU-U.S.Privacy Shield framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework in July 2020;\n\u2022the costs of developing new products, solutions and enhancements to our platform;\n\u2022whether new products successfully launch on time;\n\u2022our ability to manage our growth, including scaling our platform;\n\u2022the success of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022the costs of successfully integrating acquired companies and employees into our operations, including costs related to the integration of Elevaate and Ubimo;\n\u2022changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy and data protection, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\n\u2022our ability to deal effectively with fraudulent transactions or customer disputes;\n\u2022our ability to collect payment for services timely, as COVID-19 pandemic may cause liquidity issues for some of our customers;\n\u2022the attraction and retention of qualified employees and key personnel, which can be affected by changes in U.S. immigration policies;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u2022changes in accounting rules, tax laws or interpretations thereof; and\n\u2022changes in the way we process and deliver our services, which could affect whether revenue is recognized on a net or gross basis.\nThe effects of these factors individually or in combination, including the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate, and affect our ability to forecast those results and our ability to achieve those forecasts. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet or exceeding the expectations of our investors or financial analysts for any period. In addition, we may release guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, quarterly earnings releases, investor day, or otherwise, based on predictions of our management, which are necessarily uncertain in nature. The guidance provided depends on our prediction of demand for our platform, maintaining and growing our retailer network, cost of maintaining retailer partnerships which can fluctuate greatly and are beyond our control. Our guidance may vary materially from actual results. If our revenue or operating results, or the rate of growth of our revenue or operating results, fall below or above the expectations of our investors or financial analysts, or below or above any forecasts or guidance we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below or above the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline or increase substantially. Such a stock price decline or increase could occur even when we have met our own or other publicly stated revenue or earnings forecasts. Our failure to meet our own or other publicly stated revenue or earnings forecasts, or even when we meet our own forecasts but fall short of analyst or investor expectations, could cause our stock price to decline and expose us to costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. Such litigation against us could impose substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources. If we exceed our own or other publicly stated revenue or earnings forecasts, or even when we meet our own forecasts but exceed analyst or investor expectations, our stock price could increase.\nIf we are unable to successfully respond to changes in the digital promotions market, our business could be negatively affected.\nAs consumer demand for digital promotions has increased, promotion spending has shifted from traditional promotions through traditional offline or analog channels, such as newspapers and direct mail, to digital coupons. Although we expect CPGs to reduce and eventually stop spending on the offline free-standing insert (\"FSI\"), our expectations regarding the timing of such change or our expectations that CPGs will shift some of their FSI budgets to our platforms or about the timing of such shifts may not be accurate. It is also difficult to predict whether CPGs will decide to shift FSI budgets to other marketing channels if digital promotions lose favor with CPGs, retailers or consumers. For example, some large retailers do not yet use digital paperless promotions. In the event of these or any other changes to the market, our continued success will depend on our ability to successfully adjust our strategy to meet the changing market dynamics. We will need to continue to grow demand for our platforms by CPGs, retailers and consumers, including through continued innovation and implementation of new initiatives associated with digital promotions. If a retailer decides not to accept digital paperless promotions, CPGs reduce spend in digital promotions, or CPGs chooses our competitors\u2019 products and services, our business could be negatively affected.\nIf the demand for digital promotions does not continue to grow as we expect, or if we fail to successfully address this demand, our business will be harmed. For example, the growth of our revenue and gross margins require increasing or maintaining the number of brands that are using our promotions platforms within each CPG. If our projections regarding the adoption and usage of our promotions platforms by retailers, CPGs and consumers, do not occur or are slower than expected, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be harmed. Even if we are successful in driving the adoption and usage of promotions platforms by retailers, CPGs and consumers, if our fee arrangements or transaction volumes, or the mix and quality of offers, change or do not meet our projections, our revenues may be negatively affected. We expect that the market will evolve in ways which may be difficult to predict. For example, if consumer demand for our software-free print solution, in-lane promotions, national rebates, or our mobile applications does not grow as we expect or decreases, our business may be negatively affected. If we are unable to grow or successfully respond to changes in the digital promotions market, our business could be negatively affected and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. For example, some retailers discontinued the acceptance of paper coupons for a variety of reasons, including to address the fear that COVID-19 may be transmitted through paper. If retailers and consumers refuse to use our solutions involving paper, such as digital print, in-lane offers and national rebates, our business could be negatively affected. Our revenues may also be negatively affected if we are unable to manage the transition and the growth of digital paperless coupons is slower than the decline in digital print coupons. Conversely, acceleration of this shift (from, for example, acceptance of digital paperless coupons by new retailers) could lead to unanticipated increases in revenue.\nIf we fail to maintain and expand the use by consumers of digital promotions on our platform, our revenues and business will be negatively affected.\nWe must continue to maintain and expand the use by consumers of digital promotions in order to increase the attractiveness of our platforms to CPGs and retailers and to increase revenues and achieve profitability. If consumers do not perceive that we offer a broad selection of relevant and high-quality digital promotions, or that the usage of digital promotions is easy and convenient through our platforms, we may not be able to attract or retain consumers. In addition, as consumer behavior in accessing digital promotions changes and new distribution channels emerge, if we do not successfully respond and do not develop products or solutions that are widely accepted we may be unable to retain consumers or attract new consumers and as a result our business may suffer. We also depend on our retail partners to devote sufficient time, resources or funds to the promotion of our platforms and marketing of our digital promotions to consumers. If we are unable to maintain and expand the use by consumers of digital promotions on our platforms and consumer properties, as well as the digital properties and channels of retailers and other publishers in our network, or if we do not do so to a greater extent than our competitors, CPGs may find that offering digital promotions on our platforms do not reach consumers with the scale and effectiveness that is compelling to them. Likewise, if retailers find that use of our platforms does not increase sales of the promoted products and consumer loyalty to the retailer to the extent they expect, then the revenues we generate may not increase to the extent we expect or may decrease. Any of these could harm our business. Additionally, consumer shopping behavior has changed dramatically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, shoppers continue to minimize shopping trips, rely on online grocery shopping, change buying habits as their lifestyles were impacted by state and local orders and social distancing. If consumers decide not to use our products that involve paper as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and do not find our purely digital products compelling, our business could be harmed.\nCompetition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nWe expect competition in digital marketing to continue to increase. This industry is competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. We compete against a variety of companies with respect to different aspects of our business, including:\n\u2022providers of digital promotions such as Valassis\u2019 Redplum.com, Catalina Marketing Corporation\u2019s Cellfire, Inmar/You Technology, Neptune Retail Services\u2019 (formerly known as News America Marketing) SmartSource; companies that offer cash back solutions such as iBotta, Inc., Neptune Retail Services\u2019 Checkout 51; companies providing other eCommerce based services that allow consumers to obtain direct or indirect discounts on purchases; and companies that offer coupon codes such as RetailMeNot, Inc., which recently entered into an agreement to be purchased by J2 Global, Inc., Groupon, Inc., Exponential Interactive, Inc.\u2019s TechBargains.com, Savings.com, Inc., Honey Science Corporation, which was acquired by PayPal Holdings, Inc., and Rakuten, Inc.;\n\u2022offline coupon and discount services, as well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide coupon promotions and discounts on products and services in free standing inserts or other forms, including Valassis Communications, Inc., Neptune Retail Services and Catalina Marketing Corporation;\n\u2022retailers who develop and manage digital advertising or data products in-house, such as The Kroger Company with its wholly owned subsidiary of 84.51\u00b0;\n\u2022Internet sites and blogs that are focused on specific communities or interests that offer promotions or discount arrangements related to such communities or interests;\n\u2022companies offering online and marketing services to retailers and CPGs, such as MyWebGrocer, Inc. and Flipp Corp.; and\n\u2022companies offering digital advertising technology, inventory, data, and services solutions and channels for CPGs and retailers including: Alphabet Inc., Facebook, Inc., Pinterest, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Adobe Inc.,, The Trade Desk Inc., Oracle Corporation, Criteo S.A., Microsoft Corporation, and others.\nWe believe the principal factors that generally determine a company\u2019s competitive advantage in our market include the following:\n\u2022scale and effectiveness of reach in connecting CPGs and retailers to consumers in a digital manner, through web, mobile and other digital properties;\n\u2022scale and reach of our retailer network;\n\u2022scale and reach of our targetable audience data;\n\u2022ability to attract consumers to our platform;\n\u2022platform security, usability, scalability, reliability and availability;\n\u2022integration with retailer applications, POS systems, and consumer channels;\n\u2022access to consumer data;\n\u2022measurement that demonstrates the effectiveness of campaigns;\n\u2022quality of tools, reporting and analytics for planning, development and optimization of digital marketing campaigns;\n\u2022integration of products and solutions;\n\u2022rapid deployment of products and services for customers;\n\u2022breadth, quality and relevance of our solutions;\n\u2022ability to deliver high quality and increasing number of digital promotions that are widely available and easy to use in consumers\u2019 preferred form;\n\u2022brand recognition and reputation; and\n\u2022ability to recruit, retain and train employees.\nWe are subject to competition from large, well-established companies which have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do and have offerings that compete with our platforms or may choose to offer digital promotions and media and audiences as an add-on to their core business on their own or in partnership with one of our competitors that would directly compete with ours. Many of our larger actual and potential competitors have the resources to significantly change the nature of the digital promotions industry to their advantage, which could materially disadvantage us. For example, Alphabet Inc. and Facebook, Inc., retailers such as Kroger, online retailers such as Amazon have highly trafficked industry platforms which they have leveraged, or could leverage, to distribute digital promotions and media that could negatively affect our business. In addition, these potential competitors may have greater access to first-party data, be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer habits. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to attract more consumers and, as a result, more CPGs and retailers, or generate revenues more effectively than we do. Our competitors may offer digital promotions or targeted media campaigns that are similar to the digital promotions and targeted media campaigns we offer or that achieve greater market acceptance than those we offer. We are also subject to competition from smaller companies that launch similar or new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance.\nOur success depends on the effectiveness of our platforms in connecting CPGs and retailers with consumers and with attracting consumer use of the digital promotions and media delivered through our platforms. To the extent we fail to provide digital promotions and media for high quality, relevant products, or otherwise fail to successfully reach consumers on their mobile device or elsewhere, consumers may become dissatisfied with our platforms and decide not to use our digital promotions or interact with our digital media and elect to use or view the digital promotions and media distributed by one of our competitors. As a result of these factors, our CPGs and retailers may not receive the benefits they expect, and CPGs may use the offerings of one of our competitors, and retailers may elect to handle promotions and media themselves or exclude us from integrating with their in-store and POS systems or consumer channels, and our operating results would be adversely affected. Similarly, if retailers elect to use a competitive distribution network or platform, and we do not have, or fail to maintain, an agreement to distribute content through that network or platform, CPGs may elect to provide digital promotions and media directly to that network or platform, instead of through our platform. If retailers and CPGs require our platforms to integrate\nwith competitive offerings instead of using our products, we could lose some of our competitive advantage and our business could be negatively affected.\nWe also face significant competition for trade promotion and marketing spending. We compete against online and mobile businesses, including those referenced above, and traditional advertising outlets, such as television, radio and print, and marketing spending. In order to grow our revenues and improve our operating results, we must increase our share of CPG spending on digital promotions and media relative to traditional sources and relative to our competitors, many of whom are larger companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted media products.\nWe also directly compete with retailers who develop and manage digital advertising or data products in-house, such as The Kroger Company with its wholly owned subsidiary of 84.51. Many retailers market and offer their own digital advertising solutions, including retailer performance media, targetable audiences and sponsor search, directly to CPGs. We also compete with retailers directly and indirectly for consumer traffic. Retailers will market promotions and media and directly to consumers using their own websites, email newsletters and alerts, mobile applications and social media channels. Additionally, some retailers also market and offer their own digital promotions and media directly to consumers using our platforms for which we earn no revenue. Our retailers could be more successful than we are at marketing their own digital promotions and media and could decide to terminate their relationship with us.\nWe may face competition from companies we do not yet know about. If existing or new companies develop, market or offer competitive digital coupon solutions, acquire one of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance with one of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our operating results could be negatively affected. For example, on March 13, 2019, Inmar announced that it completed the acquisition of Kroger\u2019s subsidiary You Technology and entered into a long-term service agreement to provide digital coupon services to the Kroger family of stores. Following this acquisition, Inmar terminated our agreement with You Technology as of December 2019. This adversely affected our ability to distribute digital promotions through You Technology, which generated less than 5% of our revenue in 2019.\nWe depend in part on advertising agencies as intermediaries, and if we fail to develop and maintain these relationships, our business may be negatively affected.\nA growing portion of our business is conducted with advertising agencies acting on behalf of CPGs and retailers. Advertising agencies are instrumental in assisting CPGs and retailers to plan, manage and purchase media and promotions, and each advertising agency generally allocates media and promotion spend from CPGs and retailers across numerous channels. As advertising agencies represent the marketing budgets of multiple CPGs and retailers, we expect they will be able to exert more pricing pressure on us. We are still developing relationships with, and do not have exclusive relationships with, advertising agencies and we depend in part on advertising agencies to work with us as they embark on marketing campaigns for CPGs and retailers. While in most cases we have developed relationships directly with CPGs and retailers, we nevertheless depend in part on advertising agencies to present to their CPG and retailer clients the merits of our platform. Inaccurate descriptions of our platforms by advertising agencies, over whom we have no control, negative recommendations regarding use of our service offerings or failure to mention our platforms at all could hurt our business. In addition, if an advertising agency is disappointed with our platforms on a particular campaign or generally, we risk losing the business of the CPG or retailer for whom the campaign was run, and of other CPGs and retailers represented by that agency. Since many advertising agencies are affiliated with other advertising agencies in a larger corporate structure, if we fail to develop and maintain good relations with one advertising agency in such an organization, we may lose business from the affiliated advertising agencies as well.\nOur sales could be adversely impacted by industry changes relating to the use of advertising agencies. Moreover, to the extent that we do not have a direct relationship with CPGs or retailers, the value we provide to CPGs and retailers may be attributed to the advertising agency rather than to us, further limiting our ability to develop long-term relationships directly with CPG and retailers. CPGs and retailers may move from one advertising agency to another, and we may lose the underlying business. The presence advertising agencies as intermediaries between us and the CPGs and retailers thus creates a challenge to building our own brand awareness and affinity with the CPGs and retailers that are the ultimate source of our revenues. In addition, advertising agencies conducting business with us could develop similar digital marketing solutions. As such, these advertising agencies are, or may become, our competitors. If they further develop their own capabilities they may be more likely to offer\ntheir own solutions to advertisers, and our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to attract, integrate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\nAs an industry leading digital promotions and media company we compete for sales, engineering and other technical talent in a highly competitive environment against large, well-established technology companies and well-funded start-ups, which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring and integrating qualified personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.\nWe may be limited in our ability to recruit global talent by U.S. immigration laws, including those related to H1-B visas. The demand for H1-B visas to fill highly-skilled technology and computer science jobs is greater than the number of H-1B visas available each year. In addition, the regulatory environment related to immigration under the current presidential administration may increase the likelihood that immigration laws may be modified to further limit the availability of H1-B visas. If a new or revised visa program is implemented, it may impact our ability to recruit, hire and retain qualified skilled personnel, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe effects of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, operations and the markets and communities in which we and our partners operate.\nOur business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets and communities in which we and our partners operate. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread to many countries worldwide, including the United States.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many state, local and foreign governments have put in place, and others in the future may put in place, quarantines, executive orders, shelter-in-place orders and similar government orders and restrictions in order to control the spread of the disease. Such orders or restrictions, or the perception that such orders or restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects that could negatively impact productivity and disrupt our operations and those of our partners. Certain jurisdictions lifted such orders or restrictions only to return to these restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases. The effects of these indefinite travel restrictions and prolonged alternative working arrangements are unknown, and may negatively impact the productivity of our employee base, and a disproportionately negative impact on our sales and operations functions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition, while the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular is difficult to assess or predict. A recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 and its impacts could decrease marketing spend, particularly in media, adversely affecting the demand for our solutions, our business, and the value of our common stock. While we have seen CPGs historically continue to spend on promotions during economic downturns, there is no guarantee they will continue to do so.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, operations or the global economy as a whole. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the various responses to it, may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses, and expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, joint ventures, technologies, services, products and other assets and strategic investments. At any given time, we may be engaged in\ndiscussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating any acquired business may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky. The areas where we may face difficulties include:\n\u2022expected and unexpected costs incurred in identifying and pursuing strategic transactions and performing due diligence regarding potential strategic transactions that may or may not be successful;\n\u2022failure of an acquired company to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, cash flows or other desired technological and business goals;\n\u2022effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, which are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made by the acquired company;\n\u2022diversion of management time, as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration;\n\u2022disputes as a result of certain terms and conditions of our transactions, such as payment of contingent consideration, compliance with covenants, or closing adjustments;\n\u2022the need to integrate technical operations and security protocols, which may lead to significant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our products and services;\n\u2022the need to integrate the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;\n\u2022retention of key employees from the acquired company and cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022in some cases, the need to transition operations and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u2022in certain instances, the ability to exert control of acquired businesses that include earnout provisions in the agreements relating to such acquisitions or the potential obligation to fund an earnout for, or other obligations related to, a product that has not met expectations;\n\u2022the need to integrate operations across different geographies, cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022difficulties valuing intangibles related to acquired businesses, which could lead to write-offs or charges related to acquired assets or goodwill; and\n\u2022litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, users, former stockholders or other third parties and intellectual property infringement claims.\nFor example, we have acquired businesses whose technologies are new to us and with which we did not have significant experience. We have made and are making investments of resources to support such acquisitions, which will result in ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments and the integration of these acquisitions will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be negatively impacted.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions or joint ventures, or we may not realize them in the time frame expected or cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business. Future acquisitions or joint ventures may require us to issue dilutive additional equity securities, spend a substantial portion of our available cash, incur debt or contingent liabilities, amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur incremental operating expenses or write-offs of goodwill or impaired acquired intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and financial performance may suffer.\nWe have significantly expanded our operations and anticipate expanding further to pursue our growth strategy. Through acquisitions we have added multiple additional offices within the last three years. We also recently announced that we signed a lease in Salt Lake City, Utah and plan to move our principal executive offices there in mid-2021. Such expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant demands on our management, operations, technical performance, financial resources and internal control over financial reporting functions. Continued growth could strain our ability to deliver solutions on our platforms, develop and improve our operational, financial, legal and management controls, and enhance our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to manage our expansion may limit our growth, damage our reputation and negatively affect our financial performance and harm our business.\nTo effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. If we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations the scalability of our business and our operating results could suffer.\nOur current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees. We intend to continue to expand our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative organizations, and over time, expand our international operations. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, highly competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nProviding our products and services to our CPGs, retailers and consumers is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we grow our business with existing and new CPGs and retailers and develop new products and services that require enhancements to our technology infrastructure. In addition, our operating expenses, such as our sales, marketing and engineering expenses are expected to continue to grow to support our anticipated future growth. As a result of the requirements of being a public company we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. Our expenses may grow faster than our revenues, and our expenses may be greater than we anticipate. Managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, our business, operating results and financial condition would be negatively affected.\nIf our websites or those of our publishers fail to rank prominently in unpaid search results from search engines, traffic to our websites could decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search engines, such as Google. The number of consumers we attract to our websites from search engines is due in large part to how and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, major search engines frequently modify their ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites or we may receive less favorable placement which could reduce traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. For example, the search result rankings of our websites have fallen relative to the same time last year. In addition, websites must comply with search engine guidelines and policies. These guidelines and policies are complex and\nmay change at any time. If we fail to follow such guidelines and policies properly, search engines may rank our content lower in search results or could remove our content altogether from their index. Moreover, the use of voice recognition technology, such as Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri, may drive traffic away from search engines, which could reduce traffic to our website. Any reduction in the number of consumers directed to our websites could reduce the effectiveness of our coupon codes for specialty retailers and digital promotions for CPGs and retailers and could adversely impact our business and results of operations. It could also reduce our ability to sell media advertising on our sites, which would negatively impact revenues and harm our business. For example, we have seen a decline in the revenues from specialty retail and expect this trend to continue.\nFactors adversely affecting performance marketing programs and our relationships with performance marketing networks and brand partners, or the termination of these relationships, may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain merchants and our coupon codes business.\nA portion of our business is based upon consumers using coupon codes from specialty retailers in connection with the purchase of goods or services. The fees we earn for coupon codes accessed through our platforms are tracked by performance marketing networks. Third-party performance marketing networks provide publishers with affiliate tracking links that allow for revenues to be attributed to publishers. When a consumer executes a purchase on a publisher\u2019s website as a result of a performance marketing program, most performance marketing conversion tracking tools credit the most recent link or ad clicked by the consumer prior to that purchase. This practice is generally known as \u201clast-click attribution.\u201d We generate revenues through transactions for which we receive last-click attribution. Risks that may adversely affect our performance marketing programs and our relationships with performance marketing networks include the following, some of which are outside our control:\n\u2022we may not be able to adapt to changes in the way in which advertisers and merchants attribute credit to us in their performance marketing programs, whether it be \u201cfirst-click attribution\u201d or \u201cmultichannel attribution,\u201d which applies weighted values to each of a retailer\u2019s advertisements and tracks how each of those advertisements contributes to a purchase, or otherwise;\n\u2022we may not receive revenue if consumers make purchases from their mobile devices as some retailers currently do not recognize affiliate tracking links on their mobile-optimized websites or applications, and tracking mechanisms on mobile websites or applications may not function to allow retailers to properly attribute sales to us;\n\u2022we may not generate revenue if consumers use mobile devices for shopping research but make purchases using coupon codes found on our sites in ways where we do not get credit;\n\u2022refund rates for products delivered on merchant sites may be greater than we estimate;\n\u2022performance marketing networks may not provide accurate and timely reporting on which we rely, we could fail to properly recognize and report revenues and misstate financial reports, projections and budgets and misdirect our advertising, marketing and other operating efforts for a portion of our business;\n\u2022we primarily rely on a small number of performance marketing networks in non-exclusive arrangements, the loss of which could adversely affect our coupon codes business;\n\u2022we primarily rely, in connection with our search engine marketing business, on a small number of brand partners that work with us in non-exclusive arrangements, the loss of which could adversely affect our coupon codes business;\n\u2022industry changes relating to the use of performance marketing networks could adversely impact our commission revenues;\n\u2022to the extent performance marketing networks serve as intermediaries between us and merchants, it may create challenges to building our own brand awareness and affinity with merchants, and the termination of our relationship with the performance marketing networks would terminate our ability to receive payments from merchants we service through that network;\n\u2022performance marketing networks may compete with us; and\n\u2022economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on consumer spending.\nWhile coupon codes from specialty retailers represent a declining portion of our business, any of these risks could adversely affect our revenues in this area.\nFailure to deal effectively with fraudulent or other improper transactions could harm our business.\nDigital promotions can be in the form of redeemable coupons, coupon codes with unique identifiers, loyalty card linked offers, and national rebates. It is possible that third parties may create counterfeit digital coupons, coupon codes, exceed print or use limits in order, or submit fraudulent receipts to fraudulently or improperly claim discounts or credits for redemption. If we are unable to identify fraudulent national rebates claims before we pay out cash for these claims we might be unable to get reimbursement from our customers. It is possible that individuals will circumvent our anti-fraud systems using increasingly sophisticated methods or methods that our anti-fraud systems are not able to counteract. Further, we may not detect any of these unauthorized activities in a timely manner. Third parties who succeed in circumventing our anti-fraud systems may sell the fraudulent or fraudulently obtained digital coupons on social networks or claim discounts, credits or rebates that they are not entitled to, which would damage our brand and relationships with CPGs and harm our business. Legal measures we take or attempt to take against these third parties may be costly and may not be ultimately successful. In addition, our service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches, and we may be required to reimburse CPGs and retailers for any funds stolen or revenues lost as a result of such breaches. Our CPGs and retailers could also request reimbursement, or stop using our platforms and products, if they are affected by buyer fraud or other types of fraud. We may incur significant losses from fraud and counterfeit digital coupons and receipts. If our anti-fraud technical and legal measures do not succeed, our business may suffer.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses including unauthorized use or disclosure of consumer data.\nOur agreements with CPGs, retailers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products, services or other contractual obligations including those relating to data use and consumer consent. The term of these indemnity provisions generally survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments, individually or in the aggregate across customers, could harm our business.\nOur business depends on strong brands, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we receive unfavorable media coverage, our ability to retain and expand our number of CPGs, retailers and consumers will be impaired and our business and operating results will be negatively affected.\nWe believe that the brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of CPGs, retailers and consumers. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business would be negatively affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our websites, mobile applications, platforms, practices or service offerings, or the offerings of our CPGs and retailers, could adversely affect our reputation, resulting in difficulties in recruiting, decreased revenues and a negative impact on the number of CPGs and retailers we feature and our user base, the loyalty of our consumers and the number and variety of digital coupons we offer. As a result, our business could be negatively affected.\nOur use of and reliance on international research and development resources and operations may expose us to unanticipated costs or events.\nWe have research and development centers in India, France, and Israel. We expect to increase our headcount, development, and operations activity in India. There is no assurance that our reliance upon international research and development resources and operations will enable us to achieve our research and development and\noperational goals or greater resource efficiency. Further, our international research and development and operations efforts involve significant risks, including:\n\u2022difficulty hiring and retaining appropriate personnel due to intense competition for such resources and resulting wage inflation in the cities where our research and development activities and operations are located;\n\u2022different labor regulations, especially in the European Union, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\n\u2022exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and similar applicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022delays and inefficiencies caused by geographical separation of our international research and development activities and operations and other challenges inherent to efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u2022the knowledge transfer related to our technology and resulting exposure to misappropriation of intellectual property or information that is proprietary to us, our customers and other third parties;\n\u2022heightened exposure to change in the economic, security and political conditions in the countries where our research and development activities and operations are located;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates and regulatory compliance in the countries where our research and development activities and operations are located; and\n\u2022interruptions to our operations in the countries where our research and development activities and operations are located as a result of floods and other natural catastrophic events as well as other events beyond our control such as power disruptions or terrorism.\nDifficulties resulting from the factors above could increase our research and development or operational expenses, delay the introduction of new products, or impact our product quality, the occurrence of any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to expand effectively in international markets, our revenues and our business may be negatively affected.\nWe currently generate almost all of our revenues from the United States. We also operate to a limited extent in the United Kingdom, France and other countries in Europe. Many CPGs and retailers on our platforms have global operations and we plan to grow our operations and offerings through expansion in existing international markets and by partnering with our CPGs and retailers to enter new geographies that are important to them. Further expansion into international markets will require management attention and resources and we have limited experience entering new geographic markets. Entering new foreign markets will require us to localize our services to conform to a wide variety of local cultures, business practices, laws and policies. The different commercial and Internet infrastructure in other countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our business model. In some countries, we will compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do, and we may not benefit from first-to-market advantages. We may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations. As we expand internationally, we will be subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:\n\u2022competition with strong local competitors and preference for local providers, or foreign companies entering the same markets;\n\u2022the cost and resources required to localize our platform;\n\u2022burdens of complying with a wide variety of different laws and regulations, including intellectual property laws and regulation of digital coupons and media, Internet services, privacy and data protection, marketing and consumer protection laws, anti-competition regulations and different liability standards, which may limit or prevent us from offering of our solutions in some jurisdictions or limit our ability to enforce contractual obligations;\n\u2022differences in how trade marketing spend is allocated;\n\u2022differences in the way digital promotions and media are delivered and how consumers access and use digital promotions;\n\u2022technology compatibility;\n\u2022difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022different employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers\u2019 councils and labor unions;\n\u2022shorter payment cycles, different accounting practices and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022higher product return rates;\n\u2022seasonal reductions in business activity;\n\u2022adverse tax effects and foreign exchange controls making it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash; and\n\u2022political and economic instability.\nOur planned corporate structure and intercompany arrangements will be implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws. However, the tax benefits which we intend to eventually derive could be undermined if we are unable to adapt the manner in which we operate our business and due to changing tax laws.\nOur failure to manage these risks and challenges successfully could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation, Tax Law or Accounting Standards\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations and industry standards, and unfavorable interpretations of, or changes in, or our actual and perceived failure to comply with these laws, regulations and industry standards could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of foreign, federal, state, local and municipal laws, regulations and industry standards that relate to privacy, electronic communications, data protection, intellectual property, eCommerce, competition, price discrimination, consumer protection, taxation, and the use of promotions. Many of these laws, regulations, and standards are still evolving and being tested in courts and industry standards are still developing. Our business, including our ability to operate and expand, could be adversely affected if legislation, regulations or industry standards are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices or the design of our platform. Existing and future laws, regulations and industry standards could restrict our operations, and our ability to retain or increase our CPGs and retailers and consumers\u2019 use of digital promotions delivered on our platforms may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenues as anticipated.\nFor example, California also enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, which affords consumers expanded privacy protections as of January 1, 2020. The potential effects of this legislation are far reaching and has required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. For example, the CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of the sale of personal information with third parties and provides a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches. The CCPA also provides for civil\npenalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase the risk of data breach litigation, all of which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. In addition, California voters recently approved the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, that goes into effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA would, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit the use of their sensitive information, provide for penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the law.\nThe enactment of the CCPA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other states in the United States, which could create the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Some countries also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and Processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of operating our products and services and other aspects of our business.\nCompliance with these and any other applicable privacy, data protection, data security, marketing and consumer protection guidelines, laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with them. We believe our policies and practices comply in material respects with these guidelines, laws and regulations. However, if our belief is incorrect, or if these guidelines, laws or regulations or their interpretation change or new legislation or regulations are enacted, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations. Further, we could be compelled to provide additional disclosures to our consumers, obtain additional consents from our consumers before collecting, using, or disclosing their information or implement new safeguards or business processes to help individuals manage our use of their information, among other changes. We also cannot control our retail partners\u2019 approach or interpretation of CCPA, the CPRA or other privacy regulations, which may impact their willingness or ability to provide us data that our platforms and solutions are dependent upon, or the terms on which they are willing or able to provide it. Changes to our data sources may restrict our ability to maintain or grow our revenues as anticipated.\nIf our estimates or judgements relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, treatment of our convertible senior notes, revenue recognition, promotion revenue, media revenue, gross versus net revenue reporting, arrangements with multiple performance obligations, stock-based compensation and provision for income taxes. For example, the recognition of our revenue is governed by certain criteria that determine whether we report revenue either on a gross basis, as a principal, or net basis, as an agent, depending upon the nature of the sales transaction. Historically, our media products revenue has generally been recognized on a gross basis. However, effective second quarter of 2020, we modified the way we process and deliver certain media products to enhance the customer experience. As a result of these changes, we expect that we will recognize certain revenue on a net basis, as compared to the prior recognition on a gross basis, and expect this will cause a decrease in our revenue growth and impact our revenues. We may have gross reporting for portions of our media products and other revenue in the future as a result of the evolution of our existing business practices, development of new products, acquisitions, or changes in accounting standards or interpretations, that in any case result in transactions with characteristics that dictate gross reporting. It is also possible that revenue reporting for existing businesses may change from gross to net or vice versa as a result of changes in contract terms or transaction mechanics. We may experience significant fluctuations in revenue in future periods depending upon, in part, the nature of our sales and our reporting of such revenue and related accounting treatment, without proportionate correlation to our underlying activity or net income. Any combination of net and gross revenue reporting would require us to make estimates and assumptions about the mix of gross and net-reported transactions based upon the volumes and characteristics of the transactions we think will make up the total mix of revenue in the period covered by the projection. Those estimates and assumptions may be inaccurate when made, or may be\nrendered inaccurate by subsequent circumstances, such as changing the characteristics of our offerings or particular transactions in response to client demands, market developments, regulatory pressures, acquisitions, and other factors. Even apparently minor changes in transaction terms from those initially envisioned can result in different accounting conclusions from those foreseen. In addition, we may incorrectly extrapolate from revenue recognition treatment of prior transactions to future transactions that we believe are similar, but that ultimately are determined to have different characteristics that dictate different revenue reporting treatment. These factors may make our financial reporting more complex and difficult for investors to understand, may make comparison of our results of operations to prior periods or other companies more difficult, may make it more difficult for us to give accurate guidance, and could increase the potential for reporting errors.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection, marketing and consumer protection laws, regulations and industry standards, or the expansion of current or the enactment or adoption of new privacy, data protection, marketing and consumer protection laws, regulations or industry standards, could adversely affect our business.\nWe process data about consumers, including personally identifiable information or personal data, as well as other confidential or proprietary information necessary to operate our business, for legal and marketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes. We collect such information from individuals located both in the United States and abroad and may store or Process such information outside the country in which it was collected.\nData privacy and regulation of privacy, information security and Processing has become a significant issue in the United States, countries in Europe, and in other countries across the globe. The legal and regulatory framework for privacy and security issues is rapidly evolving, and is expected to increase our compliance costs and exposure to liability. We and our service providers and partners are subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations and industry standards regarding privacy, data protection, data security, marketing and consumer protection, which address the collection, storing, sharing, using, processing, disclosure and protection of data relating to individuals, as well as the tracking of consumer behavior and other consumer data (\u201cData Protection Laws\u201d). We are also subject to laws, regulations and industry standards relating to endorsements and influencer marketing. Many of these laws, regulations and industry standards are changing, may be subject to differing interpretations, may be inconsistent among countries, or conflict with other rules, and may be costly to comply with or inconsistent among jurisdictions.\nVarious industry standards on privacy and data security have been developed and are expected to continue to develop, which may be adopted by industry participants at any time. We have committed to comply, and generally require our customers and partners to comply, with applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Code of Conduct and the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising in the U.S. Trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups have also promulgated best practices and other industry standards relating to targeted advertising. Our efforts to comply with these self-regulatory principles include offering Internet users notice and choices about when advertising is served to them based, in part, on their interests. If we, our clients or partners make mistakes in the implementation of these principles, or if self-regulatory bodies expand these guidelines or government authorities issue different guidelines regarding Internet-based advertising, or opt out mechanisms fail to work as designed, or if Internet users misunderstand our technology or our commitments with respect to these principles, we may, as a result, be subject to negative publicity, government investigation, government or private litigation, or investigation by self-regulatory bodies or other accountability groups. Any such action against us, or investigations, even if meritless, could be costly and time consuming, require us to change our business practices, cause us to divert management\u2019s attention and our resources, and be damaging to our brand, reputation, and business. In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. We cannot yet determine the impact such future standards may have on our business.\nWe are or may also subject to the terms of our external and internal privacy and security policies, codes, representations, certifications, industry standards, publications and frameworks (\u201cPrivacy Policies\u201d) and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security and Processing, including contractual obligations to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-\ncompliance with Data Protection Laws or other obligations (\u201cData Protection Obligations\u201d). Our solutions depend in part on our ability to use data that we obtain in connection with our offerings, and our ability to use this data may be subject to restrictions in our commercial agreements and subject to the privacy policies of the entities that provide us with this data. Our service providers or our partners\u2019, failure to adhere to these third-party restrictions on data use may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by our business counterparties or other parties, or other liabilities, including loss of business, reputational damage, and remediation costs, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new Data Protection Obligations, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future Data Protection Obligations may have on our business. Any significant change to Data Protection Laws and Data Protection Obligations, including without limitation, regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for Processing is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our operations, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability to store and Process data and operate our business.\nData Protection Laws and data protection worldwide is, and is likely to remain, uncertain for the foreseeable future, and our actual or perceived failure to address or comply with these laws could: increase our compliance and operational costs; limit our ability to market our products or services and attract new and retain current customers; limit or eliminate our ability to Process data; expose us to regulatory scrutiny, actions, investigations, fines and penalties; result in reputational harm; lead to a loss of business result in litigation and liability, including class action litigation; cause to incur significant costs, expenses and fees (including attorney fees); cause a material adverse impact to business operations or financial results, and; otherwise result in other material harm to our business (\u201cAdverse Data Protection Impact\u201d).\nWe are subject to Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations as well as applicable foreign, federal, state, local and municipal laws, regulations and industry standards that relate to electronic communications, intellectual property, eCommerce, competition, price discrimination, consumer protection, taxation, and the use of promotions. We strive to comply with applicable laws, policies, contractual and other legal obligations as well as industry standards of conduct relating to privacy, data security, data protection, marketing and consumer protection to the extent possible, but we may at times fail to do so, or may be perceived to have failed to do so. These obligations and standards of conduct often are complex, vague, and difficult to comply with fully, and it is possible that these obligations and standards of conduct may be interpreted and applied in new ways and/ or in a manner that is inconsistent with each other or that new laws, regulations or other obligations may be enacted.\nMoreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, partners or vendors do not comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations. We may be subject to, and suffer a an Adverse Data Protection Impact if we fail (or are perceived to have failed) to comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations, or if our Privacy Policies are, in whole or part, found to be inaccurate, incomplete, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. In addition, any such failure or perceived failure could result in public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups, the media or others, which may cause us material reputational harm. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations could also subject us to litigation, claims, proceedings, actions or investigations by governmental entities, authorities or regulators, which could result in an Adverse Data Protection Impact, including required changes to our business practices, the diversion of resources and the attention of management from our business, regulatory oversights and audits, discontinuance of necessary Processing, or other remedies that adversely affect our business.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) (\u201cGDPR\u201d) went into effect in May 2018 and introduced strict requirements for Processing the personal data of European Union data subjects. The GDPR applies to us to the extent we Process the personal data of European Union data subjects. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements, an order prohibiting Processing of European data subject personal data and potential fines for noncompliance of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. European data protection laws including the GDPR also generally prohibit the transfer of personal data from Europe, including the EEA, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, to the United States and most other countries\nunless the parties to the transfer have established a legal basis for the transfer and implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data. One of the primary mechanisms allowing U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe in compliance with the GDPR has been certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the \u201cSchrems II\u201d ruling, recently invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. The Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner also recently opined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield is inadequate for transfers of data from Switzerland to the U.S. Authorities in the United Kingdom, whose data protection laws are similar to those of the European Union, may similarly invalidate use of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as mechanisms for lawful personal information transfers from those countries to the United States.\nThe Schrems II decision also raised questions about whether one of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely, the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, can lawfully be used for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States or most other countries. At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d). The European Commission recently proposed updates to the SCCs, and additional regulatory guidance has been released that seeks to imposes additional obligations on companies seeking to rely on the SCCs. As such, any transfers by us or our vendors of personal data from Europe may not comply with European data protection law; may increase our exposure to the GDPR\u2019s heightened sanctions for violations of its cross-border data transfer restrictions and may reduce demand from companies subject to European data protection laws. Additionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and operating our business. Additionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. In addition, we may experience reluctance or refusal by European consumers, retailers or CPGs to continue to using our solutions, and we may be at risk of enforcement actions taken by a European data protection authority until we ensure that all applicable data transfers to us from Europe are compliant with the European data protection laws.\nFurther, following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the EU, the United Kingdom government has initiated a process to leave the EU, known as Brexit. Following December 31, 2020, the GDPR\u2019s data protection obligations continue to apply to the United Kingdom in substantially unvaried form under the so called \u201cUK GDPR\u201d or more explicitly, the GDPR continues to form part of the laws in the United Kingdom by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended (including by the various Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (EU Exit) Regulations), which potentially exposes us to two parallel data protection regimes, each of which authorizes fines and the potential for divergent enforcement actions. In addition, it is still unclear whether the transfer of personal data from the EU to the United Kingdom will in the future continue to remain lawful under the GDPR. For example, pursuant to a post-Brexit agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU, the European Commission will continue to treat the United Kingdom as if it remained a member state of the EU in relation to transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United Kingdom, meaning such transfers may be made without a need for additional safeguards, for four months from January 1, 2021, with a potential additional two month extension. This \u201ctransition\u201d period, however, will end if and when the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision in respect of the United Kingdom or the United Kingdom amends certain UK data protection laws, or relevant aspects thereof, without the EU\u2019s consent (unless those amendments are made simply to align those UK data protection laws with the EU\u2019s data protection regime). If the European Commission does not adopt an adequacy decision with regard to personal data transfers to the United Kingdom before the expiration of the transition period, from that point onwards, the United Kingdom will be a \u201cthird country\u201d under the GDPR and such transfers will need to be made subject to GDPR-compliant safeguards (for example, the Standard Contractual Clauses). With substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of how United Kingdom will approach and address GDPR following the transition period, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations or any of our other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims, or public statements against us Any of the foregoing could result in significant liability or cause our customers to lose trust in us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, operations, financial performance and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the\nbusinesses of our customers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products and services.\nIn the United States, Data Protection Laws include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and other state and federal laws relating to privacy and data security. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of the sale of personal information with third parties and provides a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023, and would, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit the use of their sensitive information, provide for penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the law. The enactment of the CCPA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other states in the United States, which could create the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws and could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Some countries also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and Processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of providing our products and services and other aspects of our business.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. With laws and regulations in the EU, the United States, and globally imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, there is a risk that the requirements of these laws and regulations, or of contractual or other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, are interpreted or applied in a manner that is, or is alleged to be, inconsistent with our management and Processing practices, our policies or procedures, or our products and services. For instance, with the increased focus on the use of data for advertising, the anticipation and expectation of future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impact us and our existing and potential business partners and delay certain business partnerships or deals until there is greater certainty. In addition, as we expand our data analytics and other data-related product offerings there may be increased scrutiny on our use of data and we may be subject to new and unexpected regulations. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could, for example, impair our ability to collect or use information that we utilize to provide targeted digital promotions and media to consumers, CPGs and retailers, thereby impairing our ability to maintain and grow our total customers and increase revenues. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of our users\u2019 data or additional requirements for express or implied consent of users for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to modify our solutions, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop or outright prohibit new solutions and features.\nWe may face challenges in addressing their requirements of any such new laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretation of existing laws, regulations or other standards and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and such changes may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. Although we endeavor to comply with our Privacy Policies and other privacy-, data protection-, or information security-related obligations, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees or vendors to comply with our Privacy Policies and other privacy-, data protection-, or information security-related obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our Privacy Policies and our privacy-, data protection-, or information security-related obligations to customers or other third parties or any of our other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, information security, marketing or consumer protection, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, fines or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability or cause a loss of trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products and services. Moreover, if future laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretations of the foregoing limit our users\u2019, CPGs\u2019 or retailers\u2019 ability to use and share personally identifiable\ninformation or our ability to store, process and share personally identifiable information or other data, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, our revenue growth could slow, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nAdditionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors or developers, violate Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations, such violations may also put our customers\u2019 content at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to Data Protection Laws, Data Protection Obligations, or industry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our customers\u2019 content, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for the collection, use, retention, or disclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our products and services, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability to store and Process customer data or develop new applications and features.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired.\nWe are required under GAAP to review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The events and circumstances we consider include the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators and competition. In the future we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined. This could adversely impact our results of operations and harm our business.\nChanges to financial accounting standards or the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations may affect our financial statements and cause us to change our business practices.\nWe prepare our financial statements to conform to U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\u201cAICPA\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Changes to those rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For example, in August 2020, the FASB issued a new standard ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity, which generally requires companies to report our convertible debt instrument as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for the embedded conversion features. Additionally, this ASU amends the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The treasury stock method is no longer available. This new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, SOX, and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nSOX requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will be required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of SOX. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of SOX, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and could result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of management evaluations and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, our common stock may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results, and cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nState and foreign laws regulating money transmission could impact our rebates solutions.\nMany states and certain foreign jurisdictions impose license and registration obligations on those companies engaged in the business of money transmission, with varying definitions of what constitutes money transmission. If our rebates solutions were to subject us to any applicable state or foreign laws, it could subject us to increased compliance costs and delay our ability to offer this product in certain jurisdictions pending receipt of any necessary licenses or registrations. If we need to make product and operational changes in light of these laws, the growth and adoption of these products may be adversely impacted, and our revenues may negatively affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state law provisions, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset post-change taxable income. If we have experienced an ownership change our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, also could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Additionally, our NOLs arising in tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2018 are subject to expiration and may expire prior to being utilized. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, are not subject to expiration and may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such NOLs in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act. There is also a risk that our NOLs could otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities due to changes in the law, including regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our financials because we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize all of our NOLs, even if we attain profitability.\nChanges in the U.S. and foreign tax law or challenges by taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in the U.S. taxation of international activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial condition and results of operations. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Significant judgment will be required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there will be many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As we expand our business to operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws may be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nFurther, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. For example, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act, or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. income tax expense.\nRisks Related to Our Platforms, Technology and Intellectual Property\nIf our security measures or information we collect and maintain are compromised or publicly exposed, CPGs, retailers and consumers may curtail or stop using our platforms and we could be subject to claims, penalties and fines.\nWe collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of and share (\u201cProcess\u201d or \u201cProcessing\u201d) data about consumers, including personally identifiable information or personal data, as well as other confidential or proprietary information necessary to operate our business, for legal and marketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes.\nWhile we and our third-party service providers have implemented security measures designed to protect against security breaches, like all businesses that use computer systems and the Internet, our security measures, as well as those of companies we may acquire and our third-party service providers and partners, could fail or may be insufficient, resulting in the unauthorized disclosure, modification, misuse, unavailability, destruction, or loss of our or our customers\u2019 data or other sensitive information. Any security breach of our operational systems, physical facilities, or the systems of our third-party partners, or the perception that one has occurred, could result in litigation, indemnity obligations, regulatory enforcement actions, investigations, fines, penalties, mitigation and remediation costs, disputes, reputational harm, diversion of management\u2019s attention, and other liabilities and damage to our business. Even though we do not control the security measures of third parties, we may be responsible for any breach of such measures or suffer reputational harm even where we do not have recourse to the third party that caused the breach. In addition, any failure by our retail partners or other third-party partners to comply with applicable law or regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\nCyberattacks, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware attacks, business email compromises, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (including phishing) and other malicious internet-based activity are prevalent in our industry and our customers and partners\u2019 industries and continue to increase. In addition, we may experience attacks, unavailable systems, unauthorized access or disclosure due to employee or other theft or misuse, denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated attacks by nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and advanced persistent\nthreat intrusions. Despite our efforts to ensure the security, privacy, integrity, confidentiality, availability, and authenticity information technology networks and systems, Processing and information, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive and remedial measures against all data security and privacy threats. We cannot guarantee that the recovery systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other security measures that we have integrated into our systems, networks and physical facilities, which are designed to protect against, detect and minimize security breaches, will be adequate to prevent or detect service interruption, system failure data loss or theft, or other material adverse consequences. No security solution, strategy, or measures can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network or otherwise perpetrating a security incident. The risk of unauthorized circumvention of our security measures or those of our third-party providers, clients and partners has been heightened by advances in computer and software capabilities and the increasing sophistication of hackers who employ complex techniques, including without limitation, the theft or misuse of personal and financial information, counterfeiting, \u201cphishing\u201d or social engineering incidents, ransomware, extortion, publicly announcing security breaches, account takeover attacks, denial or degradation of service attacks, malware, fraudulent payment and identity theft. The techniques used to sabotage, disrupt or to obtain unauthorized access to our applications, systems, networks, or physical facilities in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently, and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures or stop security breaches while they are occurring. The recovery systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other security measures that we have integrated into our applications, systems, networks and physical facilities, which are designed to protect against, detect and minimize security breaches, may not be adequate to prevent or detect service interruption, system failure or data loss. Our applications, systems, networks, and physical facilities could be breached or personal information could be otherwise compromised due to employee error or malfeasance, if, for example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, customers or partners to disclose information or user names and/or passwords, or otherwise compromise the security of our networks, systems and/or physical facilities. Third parties may also exploit vulnerabilities in, or obtain unauthorized access to, platforms, applications, systems, networks and/or physical facilities utilized by our vendors. We have and may in the future become the target of cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our or our customers or partners\u2019 data or to disrupt our operations or ability to provide our services. While we have been successful in preventing such unauthorized access and disruption in the past, we may not continue to be successful against these or other attacks in the future.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees are temporarily working remotely, which may pose additional data security risks. If we, or our service providers and partners, experience compromises to security that result in performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of one or more of our platforms, digital properties and mobile applications, or the misuse, loss or unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information, personally identifiable information, or other personal or proprietary data, CPGs, retailers, and consumers may lose trust and confidence in us and decrease their use of our platforms or stop using our platforms entirely. Such compromises to personal or sensitive information or proprietary data could lead to litigation or other adversarial actions by business partners such as retailers or consumers.\nThe costs to respond to a security breach and/or to mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, negative publicity, and other harm to our business and our competitive position. We could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices in response to a security breach or related regulatory actions or litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have contractual and legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Most jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities, and others of security breaches involving certain types of data. In addition, our agreements with certain customers and partners may require us to notify them in the event of a security breach involving customer or partner data on our systems or those of subcontractors Processing customer or partner data on our behalf. Such mandatory disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach may cause us to breach customer contracts. Depending on the facts and circumstances of such an incident, these damages, penalties and costs could be significant and may not be covered by insurance or could exceed our applicable insurance coverage limits. Such an event also could harm our reputation and result in litigation against us. Any of these results could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our agreements with certain customers may require us to use industry-standard, reasonable, or other\nspecified measures to safeguard sensitive personal information or confidential information, and any actual or perceived breach of such measures may increase the likelihood and frequency of customer audits under our agreements, which is likely to increase the costs of doing business. An actual or perceived security breach could lead to claims by our customers, or other relevant stakeholders that we have failed to comply with such legal or contractual obligations. As a result, we could be subject to legal action or our customers could end their relationships with us. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability in our contracts, which we have in certain agreements, would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages.\nLitigation resulting from security breaches may adversely affect our business. Unauthorized access to our applications, systems, networks, or physical facilities could result in litigation with our customers or other relevant stakeholders. These proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management\u2019s time and attention, increase our costs of doing business, or adversely affect our reputation. We could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our business and operational capabilities in response to such litigation, which could have an adverse effect on our business. If a security breach were to occur, and the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data or the data of our partners or our customers was disrupted, we could incur significant liability, or our applications, systems, or networks may be perceived as less desirable, which could negatively affect our business and damage our reputation.\nIf we fail to detect or remediate a security breach in a timely manner, or a breach otherwise affects a large amount of data of one or more customers or partners, or if we suffer a cyberattack that impacts our ability to operate our applications, systems, or networks, we may suffer material damage to our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, we may not have adequate insurance coverage for security incidents or breaches, including fines, judgments, settlements, penalties, costs, attorney fees and other impacts that arise out of incidents or breaches. Depending on the facts and circumstances of such an incident, the damages, penalties and costs could be significant and may not be covered by insurance or could exceed our applicable insurance coverage limits. If the impacts of a security incident or breach, or the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), it could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to all or part of any future claim or loss. Our risks are likely to increase as we continue to expand our applications, systems, or networks, grow our customer base, and Process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of proprietary and sensitive data.\nRemediation of any potential cyber security breach may involve significant time, resources, and expenses, which may result in potential regulatory inquiries, litigation or other investigations, and can affect our financial and operational condition.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on the collection, reliability, and use of significant amounts of data from various sources, which may be restricted by consumer choice, restrictions imposed by retailers, publishers and browsers or other software developers, changes in technology, and new developments in laws, regulations and industry requirements or standards.\nOur ability to deliver our solutions depends on our ability to successfully leverage data, including data that we collect from consumers, data we receive from retailers and other parties, and data from our own operating history. Using loyalty card numbers both on-line and in-store, device identifiers (including Google AdID and Apple IDFA), cookies, and other tracking technologies, we, our retail partners and other data providers collect information about the interactions of consumers with our retail partners\u2019 digital properties and in-store, our owned and operated properties, and certain other publisher sites and mobile applications, as well as other data such as location. We may enhance this data with other data, such as demographic information that we obtain from data providers. Our ability to successfully leverage such data depends on our continued ability to access and use such data, which can be restricted by a number of factors, including consumer choice, the success in obtaining consumer consent, restrictions imposed by our retail and other data partners or other third parties, publishers and web browser developers or other software developers, changes in technology, including changes in web browser technology, and new developments in, or new interpretations of laws, regulations and industry standards. For example, Apple has recently announced several changes to iOS that will require consumers to opt-in to sharing data with publisher sites and app, which may adversely impact our business. Consumer resistance to the collection and sharing of the data used to deliver targeted advertising, increased visibility of consent or \u201cdo not track\u201d mechanism as a result of\nindustry regulatory and/or legal developments, the adoption by consumers of browsers settings or \u201cad-blocking\u201d software and the development and deployment of new technologies could materially impact our ability to collect data or reduce our ability to deliver relevant promotions or media, which could materially impair the results of our operations. See the risk factor below titled \u201cOur business is subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations and industry standards, and unfavorable interpretations of, or changes in, or failure by us to comply with these laws, regulations and industry standards could substantially harm our business and results of operations\u201d for additional information.\nIn addition, unfavorable publicity and negative public perception about our industry or data collection and use could adversely affect our business and operating results. With the growth of online advertising and eCommerce, there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public, privacy advocates, mainstream media, governmental bodies and others regarding marketing, advertising, and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests. Any unfavorable publicity or negative public perception about our use of data or other data focused industries could affect our business and results of operations, and may lead digital publishers like Facebook to change their business practices, or trigger additional regulatory scrutiny or lawmaking that affects us. Negative public attention could cause CPGs or our retail partners to discontinue using our targeted advertising solutions and limit our ability to measure campaigns delivered through our platforms. This public scrutiny may also lead to general distrust of data and marketing companies, consumer reluctance to share and permit use of personal data and increased consumer opt-out rates, any of which could negatively influence, change or reduce our current and prospective customers\u2019 demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf the use of mobile device identifiers, third-party cookies or other tracking technology is rejected by consumers, restricted by third parties outside of our control, or otherwise subject to unfavorable regulation, our performance could decline and we could lose customers and revenue.\nWe and our third-party partners might use a number of technologies to collect information used to deliver our solutions. For instance, mobile device identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Google AdID help us and our third-party partners identify, target and measure relevant promotions and media to consumers. Advertising shown on mobile applications can also be affected by blocking or restricting use of mobile device identifiers. Data regarding interactions between users and devices are tracked mostly through stable, pseudonymous advertising identifiers that are built into the device operating system with privacy controls that allow users to express a preference with respect to data collection for advertising, including to disable the identifier. These identifiers and privacy controls are defined by the developers of the platforms through which the applications are accessed and could be changed by the platforms in a way that may negatively impact our business. For example, Apple announced early 2020 that it will require user opt-in before permitting access to Apple\u2019s unique identifier, or IDFA. Apple initially targeted fall of 2020 for implementing these changes but has pushed that date out to early this year. This shift from enabling user opt-out to an opt-in requirement is likely to have a substantial impact on the mobile advertising ecosystem and could harm our growth in this channel.\nWe also use small text files (referred to as \"cookies\"), placed through an Internet browser on a consumer's machine which corresponds to a data set that we keep on our servers, to gather important data to help deliver our solution. Certain of our cookies, including those that we predominantly use in delivering our solution through Internet browsers, are known as \"third-party\" cookies because they are delivered by third parties rather than by us. Our cookies collect information, such as when a consumer views an advertisement, clicks on an advertisement, or visits one of our advertisers' websites. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, and certain states within the United States, such as California, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. When a consumer interacts with our solutions on a mobile device, we may also obtain location-based information about the user's device through our cookies or other tracking technologies. We use these technologies to achieve our customers' campaign goals, to ensure that the same consumer does not unintentionally see the same media too frequently, to report aggregate information to our customers regarding the performance of their digital promotions and marketing campaigns, and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity throughout our network. We also use data from cookies to help us decide whether and how much to bid on an opportunity to place an advertisement in a certain Internet location and at a given time in front of a particular consumer. A lack of data associated with or obtained from third-party cookies may detract from our ability to make decisions about which inventory to purchase for a customer's campaign and may adversely affect the effectiveness of our solution and harm our business.\nCookies may be deleted or blocked by consumers. The most commonly used Internet browsers (including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) allow their users to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers. Consumers can also delete cookies from their computers. Some consumers also download \"ad blocking\" software that prevents cookies from being stored on a user's computer. If more consumers adopt these settings or delete their cookies more frequently than they currently do, our business could be negatively affected. In addition, certain web browsers may block third-party cookies by default, and other browsers may do so in the future. Unless such default settings in browsers are altered by consumers to permit the placement of third-party cookies, we would be able to set fewer of our cookies in users\u2019 browsers, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, companies such as Google have publicly disclosed their intention to move away from cookies to another form of persistent unique identifier, or ID, to identify individual consumers or Internet-connected devices in the bidding process on advertising exchanges. If companies do not use shared IDs across the entire ecosystem, this could have a negative impact on our ability to find the same user across different web properties,and reduce the effectiveness of our solution.\nIn addition, in the European Union, or EU, Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the \"Cookie Directive,\" directs EU member states to ensure that collecting information on a consumer's computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the consumer has appropriately given his or her prior freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent. Similarly, this Directive, which also contains specific rules for the sending of marketing communications, limits the use of marketing texts messages and e-mails. Additionally, an e-Privacy Regulation, which will replace the Cookie Directive with requirements that could be stricter in certain respects, apply directly to activities within the EU without the need to be transposed in each Member State\u2019s Law, and could impose stricter requirements regarding the use of cookies and marketing e-mails and text messages and additional penalties for noncompliance, has been proposed, although at this time it is unclear whether it will be approved as it is currently drafted or when its requirements will be effective. We may experience challenges in obtaining appropriate consent to our use of cookies from consumers or to send marketing communications to consumers within the EU, which may affect our ability to run promotions and our operating results and business in European markets, and we may not be able to develop or implement additional tools that compensate for the lack of data associated with cookies. Moreover, even if we are able to do so, such additional tools may be subject to further regulation, time consuming to develop or costly to obtain, and less effective than our current use of cookies.\nWe allow our clients to utilize application programming interfaces (\"APIs\"), with our platform, which could result in outages or security breaches and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe use of APIs by our customers and retail partners have significantly increased in recent years. Our APIs allow customers and retail partners to integrate their own business system with our platforms. The increased use of APIs increases security and operational risks to our systems, including the risk for intrusion attacks, data theft, or denial of service attacks. Furthermore, while APIs allow greater ease and power in accessing our platform, they also increase the risk of overusing our systems, potentially causing outages. While we have taken measures intended to decrease security and outage risks associated with the use of APIs, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be successful. Our failure to prevent outages or security breaches resulting from API use could result in government enforcement actions against us, claims for damages by consumers and other affected individuals, costs associated with investigation and remediation damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies in part on electronic messaging, including emails and SMS text messages, and any technical, legal or other restrictions on the sending of electronic messages or an inability to timely deliver such communications could harm our business.\nOur business is in part dependent upon electronic messaging. We provide emails, mobile alerts and other messages to consumers informing them of the digital coupons on our websites, and we believe these communications help generate a significant portion of our revenues. We also use electronic messaging, in part, as part of the consumer sign-up and verification process. Because electronic messaging services are important to our business, if we are unable to successfully deliver electronic messages to consumers, if there are legal restrictions on delivering these messages to consumers, or if consumers do not or cannot open our messages, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. Changes in how webmail applications or other email management tools organize and prioritize email may result in our emails being delivered or routed to a less prominent location in a consumer\u2019s inbox or viewed as \u201cspam\u201d by consumers and may reduce the likelihood of that consumer opening our emails. Actions taken by third parties that block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of electronic\nmessages could also harm our business. From time to time, Internet service providers or other third parties may block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver emails or other messages to consumers.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") in the United States and laws regarding commercial electronic messaging in other jurisdictions, that would limit our ability to send such communications or impose additional requirements upon us in connection with sending such communications could also adversely impact our business. For example, the Federal Communications Commission amended certain of its regulations under the TCPA in recent years in a manner that could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. Given the enormous number of communications we send to consumers, the actual or perceived improper sending of communications or a determination that there have been violations of the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could subject us to potential risks including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws and expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. Moreover, even if we prevail, such litigation against us could impose substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe also rely on social networking messaging services to send communications. Changes to these social networking services\u2019 terms of use or terms of service that limit promotional communications, restrictions that would limit our ability or our customers\u2019 ability to send communications through their services, disruptions or downtime experienced by these social networking services or reductions in the use of or engagement with social networking services by customers and potential customers could also harm our business.\nWe rely on a third-party service for the delivery of daily emails and other forms of electronic communication, and delay or errors in the delivery of such emails or other messaging we send may occur and be beyond our control, which could damage our reputation or harm our business, financial condition and operating results. If we were unable to use our current electronic messaging services, alternate services are available; however, we believe our sales could be impacted for some period as we transition to a new provider, and the new provider may be unable to provide equivalent or satisfactory electronic messaging service. Any disruption or restriction on the distribution of our electronic messages, termination or disruption of our relationship with our messaging service providers, including our third-party service that delivers our daily emails, or any increase in our costs associated with our email and other messaging activities could harm our business.\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and scale the network infrastructure necessary to operate our platforms, including our websites and mobile applications, and any significant disruption in service could result in a loss of CPGs, retailers and consumers.\nWe deliver digital promotions and media via our platforms, including over our websites and mobile applications, as well as through those of our CPGs and retailers and our publishers and other third parties. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve CPGs and retailers, as well as consumers who use digital promotions or view media on our platforms are dependent upon the reliable performance of our platforms. As the number of our CPG customers, retailers and consumers and the number of digital promotions, digital media and information shared through our platforms continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. Our technology infrastructure and platforms are hosted across two data centers in co-location facilities in California and Virginia. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts in our data centers and equipment and related network infrastructure to handle the traffic on our platforms. The operation of these systems is expensive and complex and could result in operational failures. In the event that the number of transactions or the amount of traffic on our platforms grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional costs. In addition, as we scale, we must continually invest in our information technology, and continue to invest in information security, infrastructure and automation. Deployment of new software or processes may adversely affect the performance of our services and harm the customer experience. If we fail to support our platforms or provide a strong customer experience, our ability to retain and attract customers may be negatively affected. Interruptions in these systems or service disruptions, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, attempts to degrade or disrupt services, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our websites and platforms, and prevent CPGs, retailers or consumers from accessing our platforms. A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is hosted by third-party providers. Any disruption in these services or any failure of these providers to handle existing or\nincreased traffic could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. If we do not maintain or expand our network infrastructure successfully or if we experience operational failures, we could lose current and potential CPGs, retailers and consumers, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe currently have not experienced disruptions to our network or operations as a result of COVID-19 but there are no guarantees there will not be disruptions in the future.\nWe are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks that are supplied and managed by third parties, which could result in our inability to prevent or respond to disruptions in our services.\nOur ability to provide services to consumers depends on our ability to communicate with CPGs, retailers and consumers through the public Internet and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties. Our solutions and services also depend on the ability of our users to access the public Internet. In addition, in order to provide services promptly, our computer equipment and network servers must be functional 24 hours per day, which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by third parties and the availability of electricity, which we do not control. Severe disruptions, outages, defects, or other security performance and quality problems with one or more of these networks, including as a result of utility or third-party system interruptions, or any material change in our contractual and other business relationships with third-party providers could impair our ability to process information, which could impede our ability to provide digital promotions and media to consumers, harm our reputation, increase expenses, including significant, unplanned capital investments and/or contractual obligations, result in a loss of consumers or CPGs and retailers, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFor example, currently, as a result of work and travel restrictions related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all of our employees are working remotely and dependent upon their respective internet service providers to be able to access the internet, our systems and systems of our service providers. In other words, our business workflows now rely on availability of residential broadband bandwidth as well as connectivity which is currently under considerable strain. If the residential broadband and internet access break down under strain, our business and operations would be negatively affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success.\nWe strive to protect our intellectual property rights in a number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, contractual restrictions as well as rights provided under foreign laws. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nWe typically enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. Also, from time to time, we make our intellectual property rights available to others under license agreements. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation or disclosure of our proprietary information, infringement of our intellectual property rights or deter independent development of similar technologies by others and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such misappropriation or infringement. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation.\nObtaining and maintaining effective intellectual property rights is expensive, including the costs of defending our rights. Even where we have such rights, they may be later found to be unenforceable or have a limited scope of enforceability. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our respective trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business and operating results may be negatively affected.\nWe may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nOther parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We are, have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business, or prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nWe may lose significant brand equity in our \u201cCoupons.com\u201d domain name, our \u201cQuotient.com\u201d domain name, and other valuable domain names. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew an applicable registration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our products under new domain names, which could cause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain names in question. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names or trademarks in all countries in which we do business. Domain names similar to ours have been registered in the United States and elsewhere. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nSome of our solutions contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe use open source software in our solutions and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software and/or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations and could subject us to litigation.\nThe price of our common stock may change in response to variations in our operating results and also may change in response to other factors, including factors specific to technology companies, many of which are beyond\nour control. As a result, our stock price may experience significant volatility. Among other factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022the financial projections that we or analysts may choose to provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure for any reason to meet these projections;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022whether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022addition or loss of significant customers or commercial business partners;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022success of competitive products or services;\n\u2022the public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or others, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters or our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;\n\u2022announcements relating to litigation;\n\u2022speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;\n\u2022reports, guidance and ratings issued by securities or industry analysts;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock by our significant stockholders, officers and directors;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022our entry into new markets;\n\u2022regulatory developments in the United States or foreign countries;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; and\n\u2022changes in accounting principles.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating results of any particular companies. Moreover, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price for our stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry, even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been subject of securities litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nSubstantial future sales of shares by our stockholders could negatively affect our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We have approximately 91,743,302 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020, assuming no exercise of our outstanding options or vesting of our outstanding RSUs.\nOur equity incentive plans allow us to issue, among other things, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units and we have filed a registration statement under the Securities Act to cover the issuance of shares upon the exercise or vesting of awards granted under those plans.\nThe concentration of our common stock ownership with our executive officers, directors and owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock will limit our ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers, directors and owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock together beneficially own approximately 41% of our outstanding common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020. These stockholders therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control limits your ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. This ownership could affect the value of your shares of common stock.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has approved share repurchase programs for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. In April 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a one-year share repurchase program (\u201cMay 2019 Program\u201d) for us to repurchase up to $60.0 million of our common stock from May 2019 through May 2020. In August 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a one-year share repurchase program (the \u201cAugust 2019 Program\u201d) for us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock from August 2019 through August 2020. In March 2020, we suspended the August 2019 Program, as a precautionary measure to maximize liquidity and increase available cash on hand during this time of uncertainty and the August 2019 Program expired in August 2020. In February 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a one-year share repurchase program (\u201c2021 Program\u201d) for us to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock from February 2021 through February 2022. The 2021 Program could cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under any stock repurchase program will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to further develop our technology, access and/or retrofit additional facilities and service our indebtedness. In addition, we may face media or other scrutiny for past and any future stock repurchase programs. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that securities analysts and other third parties choose to publish about us. We do not control these analysts or other third parties. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our common stock or if one or more securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or cease publishing reports about us.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock. As a result, you can expect to receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of the stock increases.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Amongst other things, these provisions:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to defend against a takeover attempt;\n\u2022establish a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022require that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a majority stockholder vote;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office rather than by stockholders;\n\u2022prevent stockholders from calling special meetings; and\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.\nRisks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes\nWe are leveraged financially, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future growth, business needs and development plans.\nIn November 2017, we issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes (the \u201cnotes\u201d). Our leveraged capital structure could have negative consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may be limited;\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations in the future may be required for the payment of the principal amount of our existing indebtedness when it becomes due; and\n\u2022we may elect to make cash payments upon any conversion of the convertible notes, which would reduce our cash on hand\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under our notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of the notes will be entitled to convert their notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, (unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share)), we intend to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of notes do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s nonconvertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.\nThe Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.\nConversion of our notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of our notes, if such conversion occurs, will dilute the ownership interests of then-existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business is subject to interruptions, delays or failures resulting from earthquakes, other natural catastrophic events or terrorism.\nOur headquarters is currently located in Mountain View, California. Our current technology infrastructure is hosted across two data centers in co-location facilities in California and Nevada. In addition, we use two other co-location facilities in California and Virginia to host our retailer platform. Our services, operations and the data centers from which we provide our services are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the Internet, our business or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting areas where data centers upon which we rely are located, and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our websites, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nWe may in the future be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Additional equity or equity-linked financing, such as our convertible senior notes, may dilute the interests of our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business. In addition, while the potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular may be difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and could result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future.\nGlobal economic conditions could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur business has been and may continue to be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general geopolitical, economic and business conditions, conditions in the financial markets, and changes in the overall demand for, or supply of, consumer packaged goods products. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our customers' financial condition and the levels of marketing spend of our customers. While we have seen CPGs historically continue to spend on promotions during economic downturns, there is no guarantee they will continue to do so. Weakness in, and uncertainty about, global economic conditions may cause CPGs and retailers to postpone marketing in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values. As also noted in the risk factor \u201cThe effects of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, operations and the markets and communities in which we and our partners operate.,\u201d above, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty. Some CPGs continue to experience supply chain pressures and have not returned to pre-pandemic levels of promotional marketing spend. The current severe economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic has already started to lead to a global recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our marketing solutions (or change the mix of solutions demanded) and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions.\nIn addition, the economic problems affecting the financial markets and the uncertainty in global economic conditions resulted in a number of adverse effects including a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, extreme volatility in credit, equity, currency and fixed income markets, instability in the stock market and high unemployment. There could be a number of other follow-on effects from these economic developments on our business, including customer insolvencies; decreased demand for our marketing solutions; decreased customer ability to pay their accounts; and increased collections risk and defaults.", "PERMNO": 14504, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "QUOT"}
