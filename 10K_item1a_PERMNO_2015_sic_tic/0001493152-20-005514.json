{"cik": "1691077", "company": "YayYo, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline. The occurrence of any of the following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time.\nRisk Related to Our Business\nWe are an emerging growth company with a limited operating history and limited sales to date.\nThe Company is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of an emerging growth company, including the absence of an operating history, and the risk that we may be unable to successfully operate our business segments. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully operate our business segments, including without limitation the Company\u2019s technologies, products and services.\nThe Company was incorporated on November 16, 2016 and only commenced operations thereafter. The Company was incorporated pursuant to the simultaneous filing of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, as filed and stamped by the Delaware Secretary of State on November 16, 2016, and the \u201cCertificate of Conversion from a Delaware Limited Liability Company to a Delaware Corporation\u201d, as filed and stamped on the same date by the Delaware Secretary of State pursuant to Section 265 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company now operates as a \u201cC\u201d corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware. Accordingly, we have limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. You must consider the risks and difficulties we face as a small operating company with limited operating history.\nOn August 12, 2017, we announced that we were shifting our primary corporate focus in the transportation/ridesharing industry towards the vehicle rental business with a focus on developing (i) an online rideshare marketplace booking platform to service the ridesharing economy through the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Rideshare (the \u201cRideshare Platform\u201d), and (ii) the maintenance of a fleet of standard passenger vehicles to be made commercially available for rent through the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary Distinct Cars (\u201cFleet Management\u201d). Through the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries Rideshare and Distinct Cars, we have limited operating history in the vehicle rental, fleet management and transportation industry. We generated $3,289,478 in revenue for fiscal year 2018.\nOperating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot assure you that the Company will achieve or sustain profitability. The Company\u2019s prospects must be considered in light of the risks encountered by small operating companies with limited operating history, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Operating results will depend upon many factors, including our success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel, our ability to establish short term credit lines or obtain financing from other sources, our ability to develop and market new products, control costs, and general economic conditions. The Company has engaged in limited operations to date, and although the Company believes that its plans to grow, expand and scale operations organically will be successful, there is no assurance that this will be the case. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s sales projections and marketing plans will be achieved as anticipated and planned. The Company cannot assure prospective investors that it will be able to successfully develop and market its products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will need but may be unable to obtain additional funding on satisfactory terms, which could dilute our shareholders or impose burdensome financial restrictions on our business.\nWe have relied upon cash from financing activities and in the future, we hope to rely predominantly on revenues generated from operations to fund all of the cash requirements of our activities; however, we do not expect that our current cash on hand will fund our existing operations and future business growth. We will need to raise additional capital in order execute our business plan and growth goals for at least the next twelve-month period thereafter. Future financings may not be available on a timely basis, in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any debt financing or other financing of securities senior to the common stock will likely include financial and other covenants that will restrict our flexibility. Any failure to comply with these covenants would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations because we could lose our existing sources of funding and impair our ability to secure new sources of funding.\nWe have incurred net losses since inception.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated a loss of $3,930,221 and had an accumulated deficit of $25,171,915. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated a loss of $13,189,122 and had an accumulated deficit of $21,241,694. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated a loss of $6,568,863 and had an accumulated deficit of $8,052,572. Increases in costs and expenses may result in a continuation of losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will be commercially successful.\nWe have significant working capital requirements and issuance of common stock or the exercise of outstanding warrants and options to meet these working capital requirements and fund our operations may dilute your investment.\nWe have been operating at a loss since inception and our working capital requirements continue to be significant. As of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our working capital deficit was $556,395, $5,007,729 and $618,910, respectively. We have been supporting our business predominantly through the sale of debt and equity since inception. Since 2017, we have also been supporting our business through our operating cash flow from our limited operational business segments. However, to date the majority of our working capital needs have been funded through third-party capital financings. We will need additional funding to develop our business segments, to increase our sales and marketing capabilities, technologies and assets, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes. Our working capital requirements depend and will continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing of revenues, the expense involved in development of our products and services, and capital improvements. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations, we will need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations, which may have the effect of diluting our existing stockholders or restricting our ability to run our business.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, could increase our expenses and require that our assets be provided as a security for such debt. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results. Equity financing, if obtained, could result in dilution to our then existing stockholders. As of the date of this filing, we have issued and outstanding the Bellridge Capital Warrant to purchase an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock. We have also reserved an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2016 Plan\u201d). As of June 30, 2019, we have options to purchase an aggregate of 300,000 shares of our common stock outstanding pursuant to our 2016 Plan.\nWe have outstanding debt and lease commitments, which are secured by our assets and it may make it more difficult for us to make payments on our other debt and lease obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding indebtedness totaling $319,667, $2,690,181 and $909,889, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had outstanding lease obligations totaling $2,400,565, $3,790,147 and $1,593,291, respectively.\nOur debt and lease commitments could have important consequences to you. For example, they could:\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the future for our acquisitions and operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service or other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of our debt and the interest associated with our debt rather than to other areas of our business;\n\u25cf limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, creating liens on our properties, making acquisitions or paying dividends;\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our notes;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cf make us more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business.\nOur ability to meet our debt service and lease obligations depends on our future financial and operating performance, which will be impacted by general economic conditions and by financial, business and other competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competition, regulatory developments and delays in our business strategies. Our ability to meet our debt service and lease obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we can successfully execute our business strategy and successfully operate our business segments. We may not be able to execute our business strategy and our business operations may be materially impacted.\nTypical loan agreements also might contain restrictive covenants, which may impair our operating flexibility. Such loan agreements would also provide for default under certain circumstances, such as failure to meet certain financial covenants. A default under a loan agreement could result in the loan becoming immediately due and payable and, if unpaid, a judgment in favor of such lender which would be senior to our rights. A judgment creditor would have the right to foreclose on any of our assets resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, ability to generate revenue, operating results or financial condition.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future sufficient borrowings are not available to us under our credit agreements or from other sources, we might not be able to service our debt and lease commitments, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to service our debt and lease commitments, due to inadequate liquidity or otherwise, we may have to delay or cancel potential acquisitions, sell equity securities, sell assets or restructure or refinance our debt. We might not be able to sell our equity securities, sell our assets or restructure or refinance our debt on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, the terms of our agreements with original equipment manufacturers or debt agreements may prohibit us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern,\u201d and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a \u201cpandemic.\u201d The governors of New York, California and several other states, as well as mayors on many cities, have ordered their residents to cease traveling to non-essential jobs and to curtail all unnecessary travel, and to stay in their homes as much as possible in the coming weeks, as the nation confronts the escalating coronavirus outbreak, and similar restrictions have been recommended by the federal authorities and authorities in many other states and cities. Since the beginning of 2020 and the spread of COVID-19, rideshare companies have increasingly been negatively impacted. According to its recent investor update call, Uber\u2019s gross bookings in Seattle are down by 60-70%, and Uber assumes similar declines in other big cities hit by COVID-19. As Americans practice social distancing and self-isolation, Uber, Lyft, and other rideshare companies have seen a steep decline in ridership and revenue, as a result. Given that rideshare drivers are both at risk themselves and of risk to the public, and in addition to decreased demand overall, less people are even still driving. Over the past few weeks, the Company has seen a decline in revenue of approximately 20% and a negative impact on the cash flows of the business. The Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID-19 will have on its business; however, if the current economic conditions continue, the Company will be forced to significantly scale back its business operations and its growth plans, and could ultimately have a significant negative impact on the Company. We cannot at this time estimate the long term effect of this unprecedented situation on the rideshare market in general or our Company in particular.\nOur Rideshare Platform user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may seriously harm and negatively affect our reputation and our business.\nWe regularly review key metrics related to the operation of our Rideshare Platform business, including, but not limited to, our monthly average users, subscribers and customers to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been validated by an independent third party. Errors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could result in incorrect business decisions and inefficiencies. For instance, if a significant understatement or overstatement of Rideshare Platform users were to occur, we may expend resources to implement unnecessary business measures or fail to take required actions to attract a sufficient number of users to satisfy our growth strategies.\nOur Rideshare Platform emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes long-term user engagement over short-term financial condition or results of operations. That strategy may yield results that sometimes do not align with the market\u2019s expectations. If that happens, our stock price may be negatively affected.\nOur Rideshare Platform business is growing and becoming more complex, and our success depends on our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. Our focus on complexity and quick reactions could result in unintended outcomes or decisions that are poorly received by our users or partners. Our culture also prioritizes our long-term user engagement over short-term financial condition or results of operations. We frequently make decisions that may reduce our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long-term. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case, our user growth and engagement, our relationships with advertisers and partners, as well as our business, operating results, and financial condition could be seriously harmed.\nOur Rideshare Platform and software is highly technical and may contain undetected software bugs or vulnerabilities, which could manifest in ways that could seriously harm our reputation and our business.\nOur Rideshare Platform and software is highly technical and complex. Our Rideshare Platform may contain undetected software bugs, hardware errors, and other vulnerabilities. These bugs and errors can manifest in any number of ways in our products, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, malfunctions, or even permanently.\nWe also could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and seriously harm our reputation and our business. In addition, if our liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be seriously harmed.\nTo carry out our business plan we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This ability, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe do not believe that our cash flow from operating activities and our existing capital resources, including the liquidity provided by our credit agreements and lease financing arrangements, will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity financing. For more information see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Liquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations\u201d below.\nOur debt and other commitments expose us to a number of risks, including cash requirements for debt and lease obligations, availability and interest rate variability, each of which could hamper our growth and profitability.\nA significant portion of the cash flow we generate must be used to service the interest and principal payments relating to our various financial commitments, including $319,667 of total notes payable of which $0 is long-term, and $2,400,565 of lease commitment obligations of which $984,119 is long-term, as of December 31, 2019. A sustained or significant decrease in our operating cash flows could lead to an inability to meet our debt service requirements or to a failure to meet specified financial and operating covenants included in certain of our agreements. If this were to occur, it may lead to a default under one or more of our commitments. In the event of a default for this reason, or any other reason, the potential result could be the acceleration of amounts due, which could have a significant and adverse effect on us.\nBecause we finance the majority of our operating and strategic initiatives using a variety of commitments, including $2,720,232 in total notes payable and loan facilities, we are dependent on continued availability of these sources of funds. If these agreements are terminated or we are unable to access them because of a breach of financial or operating covenants or otherwise, we will likely be materially affected.\nThe interest rates we are charged on a substantial portion of our debt, including the Bellridge Note (as defined below), are variable, increasing or decreasing based on changes in certain published interest rates. Increases to such interest rates would likely result in significantly higher interest expense for us, which would negatively affect our operating results. Because many of our customers finance their vehicle purchases, increased interest rates may also decrease vehicle sales, which would negatively affect our operating results.\nWe are a holding company and as a result rely on payments from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our debt. Our subsidiaries may not be able to distribute the necessary funds to us and this could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our indebtedness.\nAs a holding company without independent means of generating operating revenues, YayYo, Inc., depends on dividends, distributions and other payments, from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations and to meet our cash needs. If the operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time are insufficient to make distributions to us, we would be unable to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness\nWe face intense competition that may lead to downward pricing or an inability to increase prices.\nThe vehicle rental and used-vehicle sale industries are highly competitive and are increasingly subject to substitution. While price is not the only competitive factor, we believe price is one of the primary competitive factors in the vehicle rental market and that technology has enabled cost-conscious customers, including business travelers, to more easily compare rates available from rental companies. In addition, our competitors may reduce prices in order to, among other things, attempt to gain a competitive advantage, capture market share, or to compensate for declines in rental activity. To the extent we do not match or remain within a reasonable competitive margin of our competitors\u2019 pricing, our revenues and results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. If competitive pressures lead us to match any of our competitors\u2019 downward pricing and we are not able to reduce our operating costs, then our margins, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFurther, we may in the future develop and launch other products or services that may be in direct competition with the various players in the ridesharing industry, such as Uber and Lyft, and all of whom have greater resources than us. There are low barriers to entry, and we expect that competition will intensify in the future. We believe that numerous factors, including price, offerings, reliability, client base, brand name and general economic trends will affect our ability to compete successfully. Our existing and future competitors may include many large companies that have substantially greater market presence and financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully. Increased competition could result in significant competition, which in turn could result in lower revenues, which could materially adversely affect our potential profitability.\nWe might incur expenses to develop products that are never successfully commercialized.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur research and development and other expenses in connection with our products business. The potential products to which we devote resources might never be successfully developed or commercialized by us for numerous reasons. For example, until June 30, 2017, we were focused on the development and commercialization of a single sign-on metasearch \u201cridesharing\u201d (the \u201cMetasearch App\u201d). We completed the development of the Metasearch App; however, we have no intention to further develop or market the Metasearch App. Such additional expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe face risks related to uninsured liabilities or future claims that exceed our insurance limits.\nOur businesses expose us to claims for personal injury, death and property damage resulting from the use of the vehicles rented by us, and for employment-related injury claims by our employees. We purchase insurance to cover us for these claims. We cannot assure you, however, that we will not be exposed to uninsured liability potentially resulting in multiple payouts or otherwise, liabilities in respect of existing or future claims exceeding the level of our insurance, availability of sufficient capital to pay any uninsured claims or the availability of insurance with unaffiliated carriers maintained on economically reasonable terms, if at all. While we have insurance for many of these risks, we retain risk relating to certain of these perils and certain perils are not covered by our insurance.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of regulatory burdens related to our operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of regulatory burdens related to our operations, and while management believes that the chosen operations and strategies are achievable in light of current economic and legal conditions, changes in the following regulatory areas may require management to make significant modifications to our stated strategies depending on future events.\nGovernmental regulations, claims and legal proceedings. Governmental regulations affect almost every aspect of our business, including the fair treatment of our employees, wage and hour issues, and our financing activities with customers. We could also be susceptible to claims or related actions if we fail to operate our business in accordance with applicable laws.\nVehicle Requirements. Federal and state governments in our markets have increasingly placed restrictions and limitations on the vehicles sold in the market in an effort to combat perceived negative environmental effects. For example, in the U.S., vehicle manufacturers are subject to federally mandated corporate average fuel economy standards which will increase substantially through 2025. Furthermore, numerous states, including California, have adopted or are considering requiring the sale of specified numbers of zero-emission vehicles. Significant increases in fuel economy requirements and new federal or state restrictions on emissions on vehicles and automobile fuels in the U.S. could adversely affect prices of and demand for the new vehicles that we sell.\nEnvironmental regulations. We are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, including those governing: discharges into the air and water; the operation and removal of storage tanks; and the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances. In the normal course of our operations we use, generate and dispose of materials covered by these laws and regulations. We face potentially significant costs relating to claims, penalties and remediation efforts in the event of non-compliance with existing and future laws and regulations.\nAccounting rules and regulations. The Financial Accounting Standards Board is currently evaluating several significant changes to generally accepted accounting standards in the U.S., including the rules governing the accounting for leases. Any such changes could significantly affect our reported financial position, earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission is currently considering adopting rules that would require us to prepare our financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, which could also result in significant changes to our reported financial position, earnings and cash flows.\nChanges in the U.S. legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including laws and regulations relating to taxes, automobile related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, licensing and franchising, automotive retail sales, fuel costs, cost and fee recovery and the banking and financing industry could disrupt our business, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of U.S. laws and regulations and changes in the level of government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, including our profitability. Those changes may come about through new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations.\nAny new, or change in existing, U.S. law and regulation with respect to optional insurance products or policies could increase our costs of compliance or make it uneconomical to offer such products, which would lead to a reduction in revenue and profitability. If customers decline to purchase supplemental liability insurance products from us as a result of any changes in these laws or otherwise, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nCertain proposed or enacted laws and regulations with respect to the banking and finance industries, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (including risk retention requirements) and amendments to the SEC\u2019s rules relating to asset-backed securities, could restrict our access to certain financing arrangements and increase our financing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe rely on third-party insurance policies to insure auto-related risks. If insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies which provide coverage for both owners and drivers on our platform. If the amount of one or more auto-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we may bear the excess liability. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay insurance claims, or (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive modeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry statistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. A number of external factors can affect the actual losses incurred for any given claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, fluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments and judicial developments. Additionally, we may encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the deficiency is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain adequate financing to continue our operations.\nWe will need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related, or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund ongoing operations and continue research and development activities, including the Rideshare Platform, and our Fleet Management business. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may pursue strategic transactions which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.\nAny future strategic acquisition or disposition of assets or a business could involve numerous risks, including: (i) potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; (ii) difficulty integrating the acquired business or segregating assets and operations to be disposed of; (iii) exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the acquisition or disposition or against any business we may acquire; (iv) changing our business profile in ways that could have unintended negative consequences; and (v) the failure to achieve anticipated synergies.\nIf we enter into significant strategic transactions, the related accounting charges may affect our financial condition and results of operations, particularly in the case of an acquisition. The financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness. A material disposition could require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof.\nWe have no long-term employment agreements in place with our executive officers.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report we have no employment agreements or similar arrangements with our executive officers. If we fail to reach mutually satisfactory agreement with our executives, any one or more of such persons may terminate their association with the Company. The loss of any one or more of these experienced executives may have a material and adverse effect on our Company and its business prospects.\nOur business operations are dependent upon the ability of our new employees to learn their new roles.\nIn connection with the transition of our business operations, we have replaced many employees in key functions. As new employees gain experience in their roles, we could experience inefficiencies or a lack of business continuity due to loss of historical knowledge and a lack of familiarity of new employees with business processes, operating requirements, policies and procedures, some of which are new, and key information technologies and related infrastructure used in our day-to-day operations and financial reporting and we may experience additional costs as new employees learn their roles and gain necessary experience. It is important to our success that these new employees quickly adapt to and excel in their new roles. If they are unable to do so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we were to lose the services of any one or more key employees, whether due to death, disability or termination of employment, our ability to successfully operate our business segments, financial plans, marketing and other objectives, could be significantly impaired.\nRaising additional capital by issuing additional securities may cause dilution to our current and future shareholders.\nWe will need to, or desire to, raise substantial additional capital in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf Our degree of success in generating rental and servicing fees from both our Fleet Management business and the Rideshare Platform;\n\u25cf The costs of establishing or acquiring sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for our services;\n\u25cf The extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies, and other strategic relationships; and\n\u25cf The costs of financing unanticipated working capital requirements and responding to competitive pressures.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, we will reduce the percentage of ownership of the then-existing shareholders, and the holders of those newly-issued equity or convertible debt securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those possessed by our then-existing shareholders. Additionally, future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock, or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock at any given time.\nIf our management is unable to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and adjust the number and mix of vehicles used in our rental operations, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could suffer.\nBecause vehicle costs typically represent our single largest expense and vehicle purchases are typically made weeks or months in advance of the expected use of the vehicle, our business is dependent upon the ability of our management to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and consumer preferences with respect to the mix of vehicles used in our rental operations. To the extent we do not purchase sufficient numbers of vehicles, or the right types of vehicles, to meet consumer demand, we may lose revenue to our competitors. If we purchase too many vehicles, our vehicle utilization could be adversely affected and we may not be able to dispose of excess vehicles in a timely and cost-effective manner. If our management is unable to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and determine the appropriate mix of vehicles used in our rental operations, including because of changes in the competitive environment or economic factors outside of our control, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could suffer.\nOur corporate governance documents provide that we will indemnify our directors, officers and employees to the fullest extent permitted by law which may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, except for liability for any:\n\u25cf breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;\n\u25cf act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n\u25cf unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or\n\u25cf transactions for which the directors derived an improper personal benefit.\nThese limitations of liability do not apply to liabilities arising under the federal or state securities laws and do not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission. Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors, officers and employees to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding. We believe that these bylaw provisions are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. The limitation of liability in our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might provide a benefit to us and our stockholders. Our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nConcentrating voting control will limit or preclude our other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval, which may negatively impact your liquidity and/or your gain on your investment.\nAs a condition to our listing on Nasdaq,(i) Ramy El-Batrawi, our founder and original Chairman of the Board and original Chief Executive Officer, resigned from all positions with the Company, (ii) X, LLC, an entity that is wholly-owned and controlled by Mr. El-Batrawi, agreed to sell 12,525,000 of its 15,425,000 shares of common stock, reducing, X, LLC\u2019s beneficial ownership to 9.9% of our common stock then outstanding, and (iii) Mr. El-Batrawi entered into a Voting Trust Agreement (the \u201cTrust\u201d) pursuant to which the voting power of all of his outstanding common stock was controlled by a trustee who was required to use the voting power of the common stock held in the Trust to vote on all matters presented for a vote of stockholders in the same proportion that the shares of common stock not subject to the Trust voted on such matters. However, the Trust terminated upon our delisting from Nasdaq, and Mr. El-Batrawi has investment and voting control over our shares beneficially owned by him (2,900,000 shares as of the date of this Annual Report).\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Gray Mars Venus Trust (\u201cGray Mars\u201d), of which John Gray is the beneficial owner, owns approximately 35.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock and thereby has a significant ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval, which may negatively impact your liquidity and/or your gain on your investment.\nIn addition to the stock controlled by John Gray, seven other individuals or entities own 34.5% of our common stock, which further concentrates the influence on corporate matters among a few shareholders.\nAs a result, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to control the management and affairs of our company and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. For example, effective January 22, 2020, eight stockholders, including the Trust and Gray Mars, acting by written consent, holding approximately 76% of our common stock then outstanding, removed three directors of the Company from office, and thereafter the remaining directors of the Company elected three new directors to fill such vacancies.\nThis concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nNegative sentiment or press regarding our founder and Chief Executive Officer and director may harm the reputation of the Company.\nMr. El-Batrawi is our founder and both a former and our current Chief Executive Officer and director. Since 2012, Mr. El-Batrawi has been the owner and Chief Executive Officer of Growth Strategy Investments, LLC and, since 2015, Mr. El-Batrawi has been the managing director of X, LLC, both of which are management companies. On April 13, 2006, Ramy El Batrawi was named, along with others officers, directors and/or associates of Genesis Intermedia, Inc., as defendants in an SEC enforcement action. In the SEC complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, entitled SEC v. Ramy El-Batrawi, et al., United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No 2: -06-cv-02247-(MRP_(RZ) (the \u201cAction\u201d). The Action alleged violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), in connection with a stock loan and manipulation scheme. The Action alleged, among other things, that defendants had violated antifraud provisions of federal securities laws by orchestrating a scheme to manipulate the stock price of Genesis Intermedia, Inc. (GENI), a now-defunct public company that was based in Van Nuys, California (the \u201cComplaint\u201d). On April 1, 2010, Mr. El-Batrawi settled the Action by entering into a final judgment by consent with the SEC, without admitting or denying the allegations contained in the Complaint (the \u201cSettlement\u201d). In connection with the voluntary Settlement of the charges set forth in the Complaint, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered the consent against Mr. El-Batrawi, which, among other things, barred Mr. El-Batrawi from acting as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years following the date of entry of the final judgment by consent. Any negative perception of Mr. El-Batrawi by our current or prospective investors, lenders, investment bankers, financial advisors, customers, service providers or suppliers, and/or any negative press stories about Mr. El-Batrawi, may harm the reputation of the Company and damage our business prospects.\nWe rely on our management team, which has little experience working together.\nWe depend on a small number of executive officers and other members of management to work effectively as a team, to execute our business strategy and operating business segments, and to manage employees and consultants. Our success will be dependent on the personal efforts of our Chief Executive Officer, our directors and such other key personnel. Any of our officers or employees can terminate his or her employment relationship at any time, and the loss of the services of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Ramy El-Batrawi, our founder and original Chairman of the Board and original Chief Executive Officer of the Company from its incorporation of the Company, resigned from all positions with the Company as a condition for being approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. After our delisting from Nasdaq, Mr. El-Batrawi was reappointed as our Chief Executive Officer and a director, and our former Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Rosen, and our former President, Boyd Bishop, resigned. Our management team has only worked together for only a very short period of time and may not work well together as a management team.\nWe may fail to respond adequately to changes in technology and customer demands.\nIn recent years our industry has been characterized by rapid changes in technology and customer demands. For example, in recent years, industry participants have taken advantage of new technologies to improve vehicle utilization, decrease customer wait times and improve customer satisfaction. Our industry has also seen the entry of new competitors whose businesses and efforts continue to introduce various types of self-driving vehicles. Our ability to continually improve our current processes, products and offerings in response to changes in technology is essential in maintaining our competitive position and maintaining current levels of customer satisfaction. We may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products or enhanced product offerings.\nUser engagement and growth depends on software and device updates beyond our control.\nOur mobile application and websites are currently available on multiple operating systems, including iOS and Android, across multiple different manufacturers, including Motorola, LG, Apple and Samsung and on thousands of devices. Changes to the device infrastructure or software updates on such devices could render our platform and services useless or inoperable and require users to utilize our website rather than our mobile application which may result in decreased user engagement. Any decrease in user engagement may devalue our value proposition to customers who may no longer continue to do business with us which may have a material adverse effect on business, financial conditions and results of operation.\nDefects in our mobile application may adversely affect our business.\nTools, code, subroutines and processes contained within our mobile application may contain defects when updates and new versions are released. Our introduction of a mobile application with defects or quality problems may result in adverse publicity, uncollectible or delayed accounts receivable, product redevelopment costs, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our services or claims by customers or others against us. Such problems or claims may have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nOur growth is expected to place, a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. As the number of our users, partners and other business partners grows, we must increasingly manage multiple relationships with various customers, strategic partners and other third parties. There can be no assurance that our systems, procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully grow and scale our services, products and offerings. Our operating results will also depend on our ability to expand sales and marketing commensurate with the growth of our business and the ridesharing industry. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nMaintaining favorable brand recognition is essential to our success, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is heavily dependent upon the favorable brand recognition that our \u201cYayYo\u201d, \u201cDistinct Cars\u201d and \u201cRideshare\u201d brand names have in the markets in which they participate. Factors affecting brand recognition are often outside our control, and our efforts to maintain or enhance favorable brand recognition, such as marketing and advertising campaigns, may not have their desired effects. In addition, it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements, particularly in foreign jurisdictions and various laws may limit our ability to enforce the terms of these agreements or to terminate the agreements. Any decline in perceived favorable recognition of our brands could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nChanges in U.S., global or regional economic conditions.\nA current decrease in economic activity in the United States or, depending on future operations, in other regions of the world in which we plan to operate our Fleet Management business segment, Rideshare Platform and related services could adversely affect demand, thus reducing our ability to generate revenue. A decline in economic conditions could reduce our users\u2019 interest in utilizing our products and services. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the fuel sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from ridesharing services, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry.\nIf our efforts to attract prospective customers to our Fleet Management business and Rideshare Platform are not successful, or we fail to retain customers or continue attracting existing customers to our products and services, our growth prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our business and generate revenue depends on retaining and expanding our total customer base, increasing revenue by effectively monetizing our Rideshare Platform user base, and increasing the number of customers to our Fleet Management business. We must convince prospective customers of the benefits of our ridesharing vehicle rental services and equipment offerings and our existing users of the continuing value of our products and services, including our Rideshare Platform. Our ability to attract new users and customers, retain existing users and customers. If we fail to keep pace with competing offerings or technological advancements to the ridesharing industry or fail to offer compelling product offerings and state-of-the-art delivery for our Rideshare Platform to meet consumer demands, our ability to grow or sustain the reach of our product and service offerings, attract and retain users and customers may be adversely affected.\nWe have no control over the Vehicle Registration Requirements or such other ridesharing vehicle requirements imposed by the major Transportation Network Company (\u201cTNC\u201d) providers, and our business may be adversely affected in the event that TNC providers restrict or limit prospective ridesharing drivers from utilizing or registering rental vehicles with the TNC.\nWe rely on the major TNC businesses that drive and service the ridesharing economy, over whom we have no control, to impose the Vehicle Registration Requirements and permit prospective ridesharing drivers to utilize lease or rental vehicles, such as our product offerings, under their employment with the major TNC ridesharing services. We cannot guarantee that each major TNC business will always permit prospective ridesharing drivers to use third-party lease or rental vehicles under their employment agreement with the TNC.\nOur business may be adversely affected if our ability to rent vehicles maintained under our Fleet Management business is limited, impaired or delayed because of a modification to the Vehicle Registration Requirements or any similar prohibition that prevents prospective ridesharing drivers from renting our Fleet Management vehicles or other third-party vehicle rentals for use under the terms of the prospective ridesharing drivers agreement with such TNC businesses.\nWe face risks of increased costs of cars, including as a result of limited supplies of competitively priced cars.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we have financed the purchase and leasing of the Hyundai cars that we rent from ACME Auto Leasing, LMP Financial Services and United Mile Fleet. Under the terms of a commercial partnership program, Hyundai USA has agreed to extend fleet program competitive pricing options below manufactures\u2019 suggested retail prices (\u201cMSRP\u201d) on all Hyundai vehicles purchased through selected dealerships. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain membership in the Hyundai commercial partnership program or continue receiving competitive pricing options below MSRP rates on all Hyundai vehicles purchased. If Hyundai USA cancels the commercial partnership program or does not offer us competitive terms and conditions, and we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of cars from other automobile manufacturers on competitive terms and conditions or below MSRP rates, then we may be forced to purchase cars at higher prices, or on terms less competitive, than for cars purchased by our competitors. In addition, certain car manufacturers, such as Ford, have adopted strategies to de-emphasize sales to the car rental industry which they view as less profitable due to historical sales incentive and other discount programs that tended to lower the average cost of cars for fleet purchasers such as us. Reduced or limited supplies of equipment together with increased prices are risks that we also face in our equipment rental business. We cannot offer assurance that we will be able to pass on increased costs of cars or equipment to our rental customers. Failure to pass on significant cost increases to our customers would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies could harm our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies, the imposition of mandatory allocations or rationing of fuel or significant increases in fuel prices. A severe or protracted disruption of fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, either by directly interfering with our normal activities or by disrupting the air travel on which a significant portion of our car rental business relies.\nThe concentration of our reservations, accounting and information technology functions at a limited number of facilities in California creates risks for us.\nWe have concentrated our reservations functions for the United States in one office location in Los Angeles, California, and we have concentrated our accounting functions for the United States in one office location in Los Angeles. In addition, our major information systems are centralized in our office location in Los Angeles. A disruption of normal business at any of our principal office location in Los Angeles, California, whether as the result of localized conditions (such as a fire or explosion) or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (such as an earthquake, storm, flood, epidemic, strike, act of war, civil unrest or terrorist act), could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting normal reservations, customer service, accounting and systems activities.\nWe face risks arising from our heavy reliance on communications networks and centralized information systems.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to accept reservations, process rental and sales transactions, manage our fleets of cars and equipment, account for our activities and otherwise conduct our business. We have centralized our information systems in one office location in Los Angeles, California, and we rely on communications service providers to link our systems with the business locations these systems serve. A simultaneous loss of both facilities, or a major disruption of communications between the systems and the locations they serve, could cause a loss of reservations, interfere with our ability to manage our fleet, slow rental and sales processes and otherwise materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. Our systems back-up plans, business continuity plans and insurance programs are designed to mitigate such a risk, not to eliminate it. In addition, because our systems contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to maintain the security of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues, increased costs and other material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nThe misuse or theft of information we possess could harm our reputation or competitive position, adversely affect the price at which shares of our common stock trade or give rise to material liabilities.\nWe possess non-public information with respect to individuals, including our customers and our current and former employees, and businesses, as well as non-public information with respect to our own affairs. The misuse or theft of that information by either our employees or third parties could result in material damage to our brand, reputation or competitive position or materially affect the price at which shares of our common stock trade. In addition, depending on the type of information involved, the nature of our relationship with the person or entity to which the information relates, the cause and the jurisdiction whose laws are applicable, that misuse or theft of information could result in governmental investigations or material civil or criminal liability. The laws that would be applicable to such a failure are rapidly evolving and becoming more burdensome.\nIf we acquire any businesses in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, or have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe intend to pursue growth primarily through internal growth, but from time to time we may consider opportunistic acquisitions which may be significant. Any future acquisition would involve numerous risks including, without limitation:\n\u25cf potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u25cf difficulty integrating the acquired business; and\n\u25cf exposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies we may acquire.\nIf we make acquisitions in the future, acquisition-related accounting charges may affect our balance sheet and results of operations. In addition, the financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions.\nOur business is cyclical, and a disruption in rental activity could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn the car rental business, a decline in economic activity typically results in a decline in both business and leisure travel and, accordingly, a decline in the volume of car rental transactions. In the equipment rental business, a decline in economic activity typically results in a decline in activity in non-residential construction and other businesses in which our equipment rental customers operate and, therefore, results in a decline in the volume of equipment rental transactions. In the case of a decline in car or equipment rental activity, we may reduce rental rates to meet competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A decline in economic activity also may have a material adverse effect on residual values realized on the disposition of our revenue earning cars and/or equipment.\nCertain significant components of our expenses, including real estate taxes, rent, utilities, maintenance and other facility-related expenses, the costs of operating our information systems and minimum staffing costs, are fixed in the short-run. Cyclical changes in our revenues do not alter those fixed expenses, typically resulting in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher and lower profitability in periods when our revenues are lower. The Company believes that the second and third quarters of the year will be stronger quarters due to their increased levels of leisure travel and construction activity. Any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during the second or third quarters could have a disproportionately material adverse effect on our liquidity and/or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with third-party partners, ridesharing services or technology providers, which could limit the information we are able to provide to users.\nWe anticipate that the demand for our products and services will be dependent on key relationships with ridesharing services, auto manufacturers, fleet providers and other industry providers. We will seek to develop and maintain relationships with these companies. Failure to continue to develop and/or maintain these relationships, and/or a failure for these relationships to yield benefit would have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, including senior management and our technology professionals, and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management and our skilled team members. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts they have undertaken and to execute and operate our business segments, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees.\nCompetition for well-qualified employees in all aspects of our business, including software engineers and other technology professionals, is intense both in the U.S. and abroad.\nOur continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees. Software engineers and technology professionals are key individuals in designing the code and algorithms necessary to our Rideshare Platform. Therefore, our ability to attract top talent and experienced engineers and technology professional is important to our success. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on non-employee third parties for important services which may impact steady growth if third parties to provide important services cannot be retained.\nWe will have a small number of employees and we do not have any operational infrastructure or prior operating history. We intend to rely on our management team, our advisors, third-party consultants, outside attorneys, advisors, accountants, auditors, and other administrators. The loss of services of any of such personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and there can be no assurance that if any or all of such personnel were to become unavailable, that qualified successors can be found, on acceptable terms.\nWe depend on third parties to provide us with services critical to our business including, equipment manufacturers that provide us with standard passenger vehicles and vehicle leasing services at competitive prices. While we believe that there is sufficient supply in the market, the failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the needed services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernmental regulation and associated legal uncertainties could limit our ability to expand our product offerings or enter into new markets and could require us to expend significant resources, including the attention of our management, to review and comply with such regulations.\nElements of the ridesharing industry are currently or will be regulated by Federal, state, city and/or local governments, and our ability to provide these services is and will continue to be affected by government regulations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies with respect to the ridesharing industry or \u201cTransportation Network Companies\u201d (\u201cTNC\u201d) could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected markets to become impractical and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, in the future, we may elect to add services or products to our business plan that compete directly with ridesharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, which could expose us to additional regulations, compliance obligations and legal challenges. In addition, our business strategy involves expansion into regions around the world, many of which have different legislation, regulatory environments, tax laws and levels of political stability. Compliance with foreign legal, governmental, regulatory or tax requirements will place demands on our time and resources, and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax consequences. It is intended that our business will assist with the processing of customer credit card transactions which would result in us receiving and storing personally identifiable information. This information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. This legislation and regulation is generally intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information, including credit card information, which is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. We could be adversely affected if government regulations require TNCs, and as a result, cause us to significantly change our business practices with respect to this type of information.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that intellectual property will be critical to our success, and that we will rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we believe that we will be issued trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property to protect our business, there can be no assurance that our operations do not, or will not, infringe valid, enforceable third-party patents of third parties or that competitors will not devise new methods of competing with us that are not covered by our anticipated patent applications. Moreover, it is intended that we will rely on intellectual property and technology developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our intended services will be provided. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. We may license in the future, certain proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take actions that might diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity. Also, to the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe anticipate that a substantial amount of our processes and technologies will be protected by trade secret laws. In order to protect these technologies and processes, we intend to rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information, including trade secrets, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases, we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. To the extent that our employees, contractors or other third parties with which we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Laws regarding trade secret rights in certain markets in which we operate may afford little or no protection to our trade secrets. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products, services by copying functionality, among other things. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and other intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our business, revenue, reputation and competitive position.\nOur business is heavily reliant upon communications networks and centralized information technology systems and the concentration of our systems creates risks for us.\nWe rely heavily on communication networks and information technology systems to accept reservations, process rental and sales transactions, manage our pricing, manage our revenue earning vehicles, manage our financing arrangements, account for our activities and otherwise conduct our business. Our reliance on these networks and systems exposes us to various risks that could cause a loss of reservations, interfere with our ability to manage our vehicles, slow rental and sales processes, adversely affect our ability to comply with our financing arrangements and otherwise materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. Our major information technology systems, reservations and accounting functions are centralized in a few locations worldwide. Any disruption, termination or substandard provision of these services, whether as the result of localized conditions (such as a fire, explosion or hacking), failure of our systems to function as designed, or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (such as an earthquake, storm, flood, epidemic, strike, act of war, civil unrest or terrorist act), could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting normal reservations, customer service, accounting and information technology functions or by eliminating access to financing arrangements. Any disruption or poor performance of our systems could lead to lower revenues, increased costs or other material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nDefects in our Rideshare Platform and its functionality and the technology powering our custom development services may adversely affect our business.\nIt is anticipated that the tools, code, subroutines and processes contained within our Rideshare Platform or the technology powering our custom development services may contain defects when introduced and also when updates and new versions are released. The introduction of our Rideshare Platform or custom development services with defects or quality problems may result in adverse publicity, product returns, reduced orders, uncollectible or delayed accounts receivable, product redevelopment costs, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or others against us. Such problems or claims may have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nManufacturer safety recalls could create risks to our business.\nOur Fleet Management vehicles may be subject to safety recalls by their manufacturers. The Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act of 2015 prohibits us from renting vehicles with open federal safety recalls and to repair or address these recalls prior to renting or selling the vehicle. Any federal safety recall with respect to our vehicles would require us to decline to rent recalled vehicles until we can arrange for the steps described in the recall to be taken. If a large number of vehicles are the subject of a recall or if needed replacement parts are not in adequate supply, we may not be able to rent recalled vehicles for a significant period of time. Those types of disruptions could jeopardize our ability to fulfill existing contractual commitments or satisfy demand for our vehicles and could also result in the loss of business to our competitors. Depending on the severity of any recall, it could materially adversely affect our revenues, create customer service problems, reduce the residual value of the recalled vehicles and harm our general reputation.\nIf we are unable to purchase adequate supplies of competitively priced vehicles and the cost of the vehicles we purchase increases, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nThe price and other terms at which we can acquire vehicles vary based on market and other conditions. For example, certain vehicle manufacturers have in the past, and may in the future, utilize strategies to de-emphasize sales to the vehicle rental industry, which can negatively impact our ability to obtain vehicles on competitive terms and conditions. Consequently, there is no guarantee that we can purchase a sufficient number of vehicles at competitive prices and on competitive terms and conditions. If we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of vehicles, or if we obtain less favorable pricing and other terms when we acquire vehicles and are unable to pass on any increased costs to our customers, then our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property, it may result in costly litigation.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not claim our current or future products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, with or without merit, could cause costly litigation that could consume significant management time. As the number of product and services offerings in the ridesharing industry increases and functionalities increasingly overlap, companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Such claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements. If required, we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements or obtain them on terms acceptable to us.\nFailure to comply with federal and state privacy laws and regulations, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nA variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. Further, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to comply with industry standards or with our own privacy policies and practices could adversely affect our business. Federal and state governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party web \u201ccookies\u201d for behavioral advertising. The regulation of these cookies and other current online advertising practices could adversely affect our business.\nOur business model is entirely dependent on the continued success and viability of the ridesharing industry and \u201ctransportation network companies\u201d, and we may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business, thereby adversely affecting our ability to generate revenues.\nPrivate drivers use their personal automobiles to pick up the customers and drive them to the desired destination in exchange for a negotiated fee. The passengers then write reviews, similar to other peer-to-peer online services. Large amounts of venture capital and private equity has been invested in a handful of these new companies, which have the potential to disrupt the traditional transportation industry. However, the ridesharing marketplace has come under increased scrutiny from governments and various interested groups (such as taxi drivers, taxi companies, environmentalists, etc.) have continuously opposed the proliferation of ridesharing services in recent years. Despite opposition from many of these interested groups and governmental agencies, on September 19, 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission (\u201cCPUC\u201d) voted unanimously to allow these ridesharing services to operate in California as a new category of business called \u201ctransportation network companies\u201d (\u201cTNC\u201d).\nIn California, licenses will be issued to qualifying TNCs, subject to new regulations that require drivers to undergo criminal background checks and vehicle inspections, receive driver training, follow a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and alcohol, and carry insurance policies with a minimum of $1 million in liability coverage. Some of the companies that are expected to receive new TNC licenses include Lyft (www.lyft.me), SideCar (www.side.cr) and UberX (www.uber.com). The CPUC has responded to rapidly evolving disruptive technology and its decision will likely set an example for cities and states across the country. Its decision is also expected to preempt ongoing efforts by some California cities to regulate or ban peer-to-peer ridesharing under their authority to license taxi companies. The City of Los Angeles, however, is currently considering a possible appeal of the CPUC decision and implementing additional regulations to TNC drivers, which have been referred to as \u201cBandit cabs\u201d by some on the City Council. Other cities across the country are also now looking at new regulations for Rideshare companies.\nAs can be gleaned from these recent events around the ridesharing industry, this new business model is not without its opponents. Some raise concerns about public safety and the potential for abuse or unintended consequences, while others question whether the new regulations require additional enforcement capability. The taxi industry, which is less than pleased to see this new competition, has criticized these ridesharing apps as operating essentially like unlicensed taxi cabs. Since the new technology uses GPS to measure the distance of a ride and the corresponding fee, the taxi industry believes that it works similarly to a taxi meter and should therefore comply with local taxi ordinances. Some of the primary concerns raised by skeptics include how liability will be allocated between the TNC and its independent contractor driver, and how the insurance industry will adapt to this new business. Proper hiring practices, training and oversight by the TNC also will be necessary to ensure public safety. The extent to which the TNCs will be inspected and the new regulations enforced is still unclear, but this will be an important means by which the public may judge the safety of this new industry. Based on the direction states and cities are heading with respect to the governance of TNCs or ridesharing services, and the ever increasing popularity and use of ridesharing services and TNCs, it is likely that a number of laws and regulations will become applicable to us or the TNCs which we rely upon for the operation of products and related services or may be adopted in the future with respect to mobile applications and/or TNCs covering issues such as: (i) liability, (ii) unionization, (iii) rules and standards for drivers, vehicles, and passenger safety, (iv) licensing and insurance requirements, and (v) environmental concerns, among others. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and the new laws and regulations to which we and/or ridesharing services will likely become subject. If ridesharing services are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to sustain our operating business segments. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of the ridesharing industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation, either directly or indirectly. Changes to these laws intended to address these issues, including some recently proposed changes, could create uncertainty in the marketplace. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service or operating costs.\nWe may be subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We anticipate accepting payment from our users primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers. The ability to access credit card information on a real time-basis without having to proactively reach out to the consumer each time we process an auto-renewal payment or a payment for the purchase of a premium feature on any of our dating products is critical to our success. When we or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards. In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party\u2019s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted, the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach. To the extent our users are ever affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party, affected users would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions. It is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected users, and even if we could, some users\u2019 new credit card information may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant user effort. Additionally, if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher credit card-related costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, the passage or adoption of any legislation or regulation affecting the ability of service providers to periodically charge consumers for recurring membership payments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon intellectual property and proprietary rights that are vulnerable to unauthorized use.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, software security measures, license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary information. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the patent or other proprietary rights of others and our ability to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary property, including our rights in any technology licenses upon which any of our products or services are based. Our inability to preserve such rights properly or operate without infringing on such rights would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently do not own any registered copyrights, patents or patent applications pending. It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of, or otherwise obtain and use, our proprietary information without authorization. In addition, there can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements between us and our employees, or any license agreements with our customers, will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such proprietary information.\nWe may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the usability, functionality, and features of our Rideshare Platform and related services. The evolving nature of the ridesharing industry, transportation network companies, telecommunications, apps, and mobile based services, which is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions and the emergence of new industry standards and practices, could render our existing systems, app and services obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop, innovate, license or acquire leading technologies useful in our business, enhance our existing solutions, develop new solutions and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective users, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner. Future advances in technology may not be beneficial to, or compatible with, our business. Furthermore, we may not successfully use new technologies effectively or adapt our proprietary technology and app to user requirements or emerging industry standards on a timely basis. Our ability to remain technologically competitive may require substantial expenditures and lead time. If we are unable to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions or user requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nWe depend on the continued growth and reliability of the internet, global positioning systems, ridesharing services and apps.\nThe recent growth in the use of apps and ridesharing services may cause periods of decreased performance for many ridesharing services, internet providers, apps and related service providers. If app and ridesharing usage continues to grow rapidly, the infrastructure these services are reliant upon (i.e. the internet, global positioning systems, and telecommunications networks and devices) may not be able to support these demands and therefore performance and reliability may decline. Decreased performance with respect to some or all of these critical components of our business model has also been attributed to illegal attacks by third parties. If outages or delays occur frequently or increase in frequency, or businesses are not able to protect themselves adequately from such illegal attacks, the market for mobile apps, ridesharing services and related technologies could grow more slowly or decline, which may reduce the demand for our Rideshare Platform and related services.\nOur business is dependent upon consumers renting our Fleet Management vehicles, using our Rideshare Platform and related services and if we fail to obtain broad adoption, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend on our ability to monetize our fleet of vehicles and our Rideshare Platform, ensuring our Rideshare Platform is fully functional and reliable as intended, operate and educate consumers regarding the benefits of renting vehicles for ridesharing opportunities, and persuade them to adopt YayYo! and/or \u201cRideshare\u201d as their \u201cgo to\u201d ridesharing vehicle rental service provider. We do not know if our products and services will be successful over the long term and market acceptance may be hindered if our Rideshare platform does not function efficiently and/or our user experience is not compelling and financially beneficial to our users. If consumers do not adopt and use our Rideshare Platform and related services, we will not be able to generate revenues and our financial condition will suffer as a result.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to market, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business strategy includes eventual international expansion. Adapting our Rideshare Platform to function internationally and doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including: (i) multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, privacy laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; (ii) obtaining regulatory approvals where required; (iii) requirements to maintain data and the processing of that data on servers located within such countries; (iv) complexities associated with managing multiple payment processing methods and multiple ridesharing service providers; (v) natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, outbreak of disease, protests, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other market restrictions; and (vi) regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over activities subject to regulation under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d), U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and comparable laws and regulations in other countries. Any of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our ability to generate revenue and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or users or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party billing and collections providers and ridesharing service partners may collect and store sensitive data, including legally-protected personal information. We may also process and store and use additional third-parties to process and store, sensitive intellectual property and other proprietary business information, including that of our customers and collaborative partners. While we intend to implemented data privacy and security measures that will be compliant with applicable privacy laws and regulations, future security breaches could subject us to liability for violations of various laws, rules or regulations, civil liability, government-imposed fines, orders requiring that we or these third parties change our or their practices, or criminal charges, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe may become a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to focus on our operating business segments.\nThe technology industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible that U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications or trademarks controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products or services, or that we may be accused of misappropriating third parties\u2019 trade secrets. Additionally, our products may include hardware and software components that we purchase from vendors and may include design components that are outside of our direct control. Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios, trade secrets, trademarks, and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents or trademarks that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, sell and/or export our products and services or to use product names. We may become a party to patent or trademark infringement or trade secret related disputes or litigation as a result of these and other third party intellectual property rights being asserted against us. The defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming. Vendors from whom we purchase hardware or software may not indemnify us in the event that such hardware or software is accused of infringing a third party\u2019s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third party\u2019s trade secret.\nFurther, if such patents, trademarks, or trade secrets are successfully asserted against us, this may harm our business and result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products, license fees, damages and the payment of attorney fees and court costs. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe third party patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade secrets, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties. Although patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property disputes in the technology industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our Rideshare Platform or related services in order to avoid infringement.\nAdditionally, in the future we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents or trademarks, if applicable, or to protect our copyrights, trade secrets or know how, trade secrets or know how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. We may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling products that are the same or similar to our products and services or from using product or service names that are the same or similar to ours, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products or from open source licensors, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to cease offering our Rideshare Platform unless and until we can re-engineer it to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. These risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could adversely affect our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use open source software in connection with our technology development. From time to time, companies that use open source software have faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source licenses require users who distribute software containing open source to make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code of the user. We intend to monitor the use of open source software and will try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. Any requirement to disclose proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business, results of operations or financial condition, and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nNo assurances of protection for proprietary rights; reliance on trade secrets.\nIn certain cases, we may rely on trade secrets to protect intellectual property, proprietary technology and processes, which we have acquired, developed or may develop in the future. There can be no assurances that secrecy obligations will be honored or that others will not independently develop similar or superior products or technology. The protection of intellectual property and/or proprietary technology through claims of trade secret status has been the subject of increasing claims and litigation by various companies both in order to protect proprietary rights as well as for competitive reasons even where proprietary claims are unsubstantiated. The prosecution of proprietary claims or the defense of such claims is costly and uncertain given the uncertainty and rapid development of the principles of law pertaining to this area. We may also be subject to claims by other parties with regard to the use of intellectual property, technology information and data, which may be deemed proprietary to others.\nOur network operations may be vulnerable to hacking, viruses and other disruptions, which may make our Rideshare online platform and related services less attractive and reliable.\nInternet usage and mobile app usage could decline if any well-publicized compromise of security occurs. Hacking involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions, loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment. Hackers, if successful, could misappropriate proprietary information or cause disruptions in our service. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect our products and services and related systems upon which our products and services is reliant against hackers. There can be no assurance that any measures we may take will be effective. Security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the inadvertent transmission if computer viruses or other digital problems could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, as well as materially damage our reputation and decrease our user base.\nWe currently have a small sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to expand our direct sales force in the U.S. to promote our services and related products, the commercial appeal and brand awareness for our products and services may be diminished.\nWe currently have a small sales and marketing organization. The Company may expand the core sales and marketing team to oversee the sales and marketing of our \u201cYayYo!\u201d business. We will incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional management resources to expand and grow our sales force. We may not be able to build on the expansion of these capabilities despite these additional expenditures. If we elect to rely on third parties to sell our products in the U.S., we may receive less revenue than if we sold our products directly. In addition, although we would intend to diligently monitor their activities, we may have little or no control over the sales efforts of those third parties. In the event we are unable to develop and expand our own sales force or collaborate with a third party to sell our products, we may not be able to operate our products and/or services which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue. We may not be able to enter into any marketing arrangements on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to enter into a marketing arrangement for our products, we may not be able to develop an effective sales force to successfully operate our products and/or services. If we fail to enter into marketing arrangements for our products and are unable to develop an effective sales force, our ability to generate revenue would be limited.\nWe currently serve a segment of the Rideshare driver market that is large and valuable, but has less than average credit and commercial financial performance. We cannot predict the future performance of this market segment.\nRideshare drivers are frequently unemployed, underemployed or otherwise financially challenged, which is one reason they are attracted to the rideshare business. We believe these drivers are critical to the rideshare ecosystem, that their numbers will grow, and they still perform financially to a degree that we can benefit. However, there can be no assurance that they will grow or maintain their percentage of the driver population, and that they will perform fiscally in a way that the company needs to generate a profit. Should they decrease in numbers or percentage of the driver population, or should we be unable to manage their successful payments for our cars, services, repairs or other charges, we may not be able to operate at a level of profit acceptable to the Company.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Securities.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink, and thus may have a limited market and lack of liquidity.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity. The OTC Pink Market is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market. The quotation of our shares on such marketplace may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock, and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock, either now or in the future, or that stockholders will be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business.\nOur existing shareholders may experience dilution if we elect to raise equity capital\nDue to our past liquidity issues, we have had to raise capital in the form of debt and/or equity to meet our working capital needs. We may also choose to issue equity or debt securities in the future to meet our liquidity or other needs which would result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we will attempt to minimize the dilutive impact of any future capital-raising activities, we cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to do so. We may have to issue additional shares of our common stock at prices at a discount from the then-current market price of our common stock. If we raise additional working capital, existing shareholders may experience dilution.\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.\nAll of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur stock is a penny stock\nOur stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined in Rule 15g-9) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors\u201d. The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities.\nSales of our common stock under our resale registration statement and under Rule 144 could reduce the price of our stock.\nAn aggregate of 25,067,786 of our outstanding shares of common stock are subject to lock-up agreements. An additional 339,125 of our outstanding shares of common stock are \u201crestricted securities\u201d and are subject to restrictions on transfer. In general, persons holding \u201crestricted securities,\u201d must hold their shares for a period of at least six months, may not sell more than 1% of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period, and must resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price. Shares shall be locked up as follows: (i) 2,900,000 shares of common stock held by X, LLC, 10,325,000 shares of common stock held by Gray Mars Venus Trust, Arizona 2015, 2,844,945 shares of common stock controlled by David Haley, 2,758,824 shares of common stock held by James Malackowiski, 2,018,750 shares of common stock held by John O\u2019Hurley and 1,654,412 shares held by Acuitas Group Holdings, LLC, until May 13, 2020; and (ii) 1,500,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants held by Bellridge Capital, L.P. for 60 days; (iii) 400,000 shares of common stock held by Bellridge Capital, L.P. for 30 days and (iv) an additional 2,165,855 shares of common stock held by other stockholders for periods ranging from 47 days to six months; provided, however, certain shares may not be subject to a lock up period in the event that such shares are sold at certain minimum prices. However, Rule 144 will only be available for resale in the 90 days after the Company becomes subject to the ongoing SEC reporting requirements. The Company may voluntarily file current reports on Form 8-K. The availability for sale of substantial amounts of common stock under Rule 144 could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities. The registration statement to which this Report relates also registers the potential resale by certain selling stockholders of an aggregate amount up to 1,650,000 shares of our common stock consisting of up to (i) 150,000 shares of our common stock and (ii) 1,500,000 shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding Bellridge Capital Warrant.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse impact on us.\nWe are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure of our public accounting firm\u2019s attestation to or report on management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nAt present, we believe that we have effective internal controls in place. However, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls that we have in place will prevent all possible errors, mistakes or all fraud.\nOur financial controls and procedures may not be sufficient to ensure timely and reliable reporting of financial information, which, as a public company, could materially harm our stock price.\nWe require significant financial resources to maintain our public reporting status. We cannot assure you we will be able to maintain adequate resources to ensure that we will not have any future material weakness in our system of internal controls. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures may in the future be limited by a variety of factors including:\n\u25cf faulty human judgment and simple errors, omissions or mistakes;\n\u25cf fraudulent action of an individual or collusion of two or more people;\n\u25cf inappropriate management override of procedures; and\n\u25cf the possibility that any enhancements to controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure timely and accurate financial information.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nDespite these controls, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Furthermore, smaller reporting companies like us face additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and can find it difficult to employ resources for complicated transactions and effective risk management. Additionally, smaller reporting companies tend to utilize general accounting software packages that lack a rigorous set of software controls.\nIf we fail to have effective controls and procedures for financial reporting in place, we could be unable to provide timely and accurate financial information and be subject to investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and civil or criminal sanctions.\nWe must implement additional and expensive procedures and controls in order to grow our business and organization and to satisfy new reporting requirements, which will increase our costs and require additional management resources.\nUpon becoming a fully public reporting company, we will be required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including the requirements that we maintain disclosure controls and procedures and adequate internal control over financial reporting. In the future, if our securities are listed on a national exchange, we may also be required to comply with marketplace rules and heightened corporate governance standards. Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other SEC and national exchange requirements will increase our costs and require additional management resources. We recently have begun upgrading our procedures and controls and will need to continue to implement additional procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy new reporting requirements. If we are unable to complete the required assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or if we fail to maintain internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely, accurate and reliable periodic financial statements could be impaired.\nIf we do not maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy of our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act. Additionally, our ability to obtain additional financing could be impaired or a lack of investor confidence in the reliability and accuracy of our public reporting could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and because we will have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards, we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including, but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by Delaware state law. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain disputes which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for claims with respect to (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (in each case, as they may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director or officer or other employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, other employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers, other employees and agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Amended and Restated Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 19083, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "YAYO"}
