{"cik": "1674227", "company": "SCWorx Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Financing Plans\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and the business of our hospital customers.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic which spread throughout the United States and the world. The outbreak adversely impacted new customer acquisition. The Company has followed the recommendations of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented demand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 business, the Company\u2019s customers were focused on meeting the nation\u2019s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources on expanding the utilization of the Company\u2019s services, which has adversely impacted the Company\u2019s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic subside. In addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due to the Company for services, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s cash flows.\nThe Company sought to mitigate these impacts to revenue through the sale of personal protective equipment (\u201cPPE\u201d) and COVID-19 rapid test kits to the health care industry, including many of the Company\u2019s hospital customers. On March 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCWorx established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Direct-Worx, LLC to endeavor to source and provide critical, difficult-to-find items for the healthcare industry. Items had become difficult to source due to unexpected disruptions within the supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The products the Company sought to source included:\n\u25cf Test Kits - the Company currently has no contracted supply of Rapid Test Kits.\n\u25cf PPE - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) includes items such as masks, gloves, gowns, shields, etc. Currently the Company has no contracted supply of PPE.\nRegarding PPE and Test Kits, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors determined during the second quarter of 2020 to limit the Company\u2019s role to acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers with commission-based compensation. We are endeavoring to sell our existing inventory of PPE products primarily through use of our internal and external sales personnel.\nThe sale of PPE and rapid test kits for COVID-19 represented a new business for the Company and was subject to the myriad risks associated with any new venture. The Company encountered great difficulty in attempting to secure reliable sources of supply for both COVID-19 Rapid Test Kits and PPE. The Company currently has no contracted supply of Rapid Test Kits or PPE. Since the inception of this business, the Company completed only minimal sales of COVID-19 rapid test kits and PPE. The Company does not expect to generate any significant revenue from the sale of PPE products or rapid test kits, and as of the date of this report, the Company has not generated any material revenue from the sale of PPE or rapid test kits.\nThe Company is no longer actively seeking to procure and sell Test Kits or PPE. Instead, the Company is focused on selling its current inventory of PPE The Company may receive commissions for acting as an intermediary with respect to the sale of PPE and/or Test Kits. However, there is no assurance the Company will realize any material revenue from these activities.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future, which could negatively impact the trading value of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were $4,632,529, and we had a net loss of $3,814,468. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were $5,213,118, and we had a net loss of $7,402,350. At December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $24,011,291.\nWe incurred losses from operations of $3,814,468 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $6,045,011 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We may continue to incur operating and net losses in future periods. These losses may increase, and we may never achieve profitability for a variety of reasons, including increased competition, decreased growth in our target market and other factors described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. If we cannot achieve sustained profitability, our stockholders may lose all or a portion of their investment in our company.\nIf we are unable to grow our revenue, we may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nTo become profitable, we must, among other things, increase our revenues. Our total revenues declined approximately $580,000 (11%) to $4,632,529 in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $5,213,118 in the year ended December 31, 2020. In order to become profitable and then maintain profitability, we must, among other things, increase our revenues while dealing with the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This decline in revenue will be exacerbated if we are unable to develop and market new products, which could help us increase our sales to existing customers or develop new customers. Even if we are able to grow our revenues, they may not be sufficient to exceed increases in our operating expenses or to enable us to achieve or sustain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors have indicated in their report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern since we may not have sufficient capital resources from operations and existing financing arrangements to meet our operating expenses and working capital requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had only limited cash on hand, a working capital deficit of $1,527,830 and accumulated deficit of $24,011,291. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of $3,814,468 and used $1,069,945 of cash in operations. We have historically incurred operating losses and may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This may hinder our ability to obtain financing or may force us to obtain financing on less favorable terms than would otherwise be available. If we are unable to develop sufficient revenues and additional customers for our products and services, we may not generate enough revenue to sustain our business, and we may fail, in which case our stockholders would suffer a total loss of their investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe currently have an immediate need for additional capital. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we will not be able to implement our business strategy or successfully operate our business; however, additional financings will subject our existing stockholders to dilution.\nTo continue our growth path, we expect to finance our future expansion plans through public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We have recently encountered some difficulty in raising funds from external sources. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to further delay or reduce the scope of our business plans. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. In addition, debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Our access to the financial markets and the pricing and terms we receive in the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including changes in financial markets and interest rates.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the costs and timing of our future acquisitions.\nA failure to successfully execute our growth strategy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSubject to the receipt of sufficient funding, which we currently do not have, we intend to pursue growth through expanding our [sales force], product offerings and project skill-sets and capabilities, as well as increasing critical mass to enable us to bid on larger contracts.\nWe may also consider potential acquisitions if conditions permit. However, we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, any completed acquisition may not result in the intended benefits. For example, while the historical financial and operating performance of an acquisition target are among the criteria we evaluate in determining which acquisition targets we will pursue, there can be no assurance that any business or assets we acquire will continue to perform in accordance with past practices or will achieve financial or operating results that are consistent with or exceed past results. Any such failure could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any completed acquisition may not result in the intended benefits for other reasons and our acquisitions will involve a number of other risks, including:\n\u25cf We may have difficulty integrating the acquired companies;\n\u25cf Our ongoing business and management\u2019s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises;\n\u25cf We may not realize the anticipated cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated;\n\u25cf We may have difficulty retaining or hiring key personnel, customers and suppliers to maintain expanded operations;\n\u25cf Our internal resources may not be adequate to support our operations as we expand, particularly if we are awarded a significant number of contracts in a short time period;\n\u25cf We may have difficulty retaining and obtaining any required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;\n\u25cf We may not be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any such financing could result in dilution to our stockholders, impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms and include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations;\n\u25cf We may have failed to, or be unable to, discover liabilities of the acquired companies during the course of performing our due diligence; and\n\u25cf We may be required to record additional goodwill as a result of an acquisition, which will reduce our tangible net worth.\nAny of these risks could prevent us from executing on any acquisition we might complete, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. At this time, we are not considering any acquisition.\nOur contracts may require us to perform extra or change order work, which can result in disputes and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur contracts generally require us to perform extra or change order work as directed by the customer, even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the extra work to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original project plans and specifications or, if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for a lengthy period of time until the change order is approved by the customer and we are paid by the customer.\nTo the extent that actual recoveries with respect to change orders or amounts subject to contract disputes or claims are less than the estimates used in our financial statements, the amount of any shortfall will reduce our future revenues and profits, and this could adversely affect our reported working capital and results of operations. In addition, any delay caused by the extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other project work and our ability to meet specified contract milestone dates.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers and the loss of one of these customers, or a reduction in their demand for our services, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur customer base is highly concentrated. Due to the size and nature of our contracts, one or a few customers have during any given year, as well as over a period of consecutive years, represented a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits. Two customers accounted for approximately 19% and 13%, respectively, of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. Two customers accounted for approximately 22% and 17%, respectively, of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenues under our contracts with significant customers may continue to vary from period to period depending on the timing or volume of work that those customers contract from us. A limited number of customers may continue to comprise a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.\nA default or delay in payment on a significant scale could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We could lose business from a significant customer for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u25cf the consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer, resulting in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity that could reduce the amount of work we receive;\n\u25cf our performance on individual contracts or relationships with one or more significant customers could become impaired due to another reason, which may cause us to lose future business with such customers and, as a result, our ability to generate income would be adversely impacted;\n\u25cf key customers could slow or stop spending on initiatives related to projects we are performing for them due to increased difficulty in the markets as a result of economic downturns or other reasons.\nSince many of our customer contracts allow our customers to terminate the contract without cause, our customers may terminate their contracts with us at will, which could impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth.\nWe will need to expand and optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. We plan to expand our account management/sales force when and if we have sufficient capital to do so. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented account management/sales personnel or if the personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the intended benefits of this investment or increase our revenue.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified executive officers and managers and consultants, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe depend on the continued efforts and abilities of our management and consultants, to establish and maintain our customer relationships and identify strategic opportunities. The loss of any one of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Competition for managerial talent with significant industry experience is high, and we may lose access to executive officers/consultants for a variety of reasons, including more attractive compensation packages offered by our competitors. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our senior level management, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management/consulting personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time.\nFines, judgments and other consequences resulting from our failure to comply with regulations or adverse outcomes in litigation proceedings could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including class action lawsuits that are brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, and consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.\nPlease refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed description of the pending legal actions and investigations.\nAny defects or errors, or failures to meet our customers\u2019 expectations could result in large damage claims against us. Claimants may seek large damage awards and, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. Any failure to properly estimate or manage cost, or delay in the completion of projects, could subject us to penalties.\nThe ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation or court judgment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. When appropriate, we establish reserves for litigation and claims that we believe to be adequate in light of current information, legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to developments. If our reserves are inadequate or insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may suffer.\nIf we are required to reclassify independent contractors as employees, we may incur additional costs and taxes which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe use a significant number of independent contractors in our operations for whom we do not pay or withhold any federal or state employment tax. There are a number of different tests used in determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor and such tests generally take into account multiple factors. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change, or at least challenge, the classification of our independent contractors. Although we believe we have properly classified our independent contractors, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other U.S. federal or state authorities or similar authorities of a foreign government may determine that we have misclassified our independent contractors for employment tax or other purposes and, as a result, seek additional taxes from us or attempt to impose fines and penalties. If we are required to pay employer taxes or pay backup withholding with respect to prior periods with respect to or on behalf of our independent contractors, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur dependence on subcontractors and suppliers could increase our cost and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on our contracts. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide materials needed to perform our obligations under those contracts. We generally do not bid on contracts unless we have the necessary subcontractors and suppliers committed for the anticipated scope of the contract and at prices that we have included in our bid. Therefore, to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or suppliers, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a subcontractor or third-party supplier is unable to deliver its goods or services according to the negotiated terms for any reason, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the services from another source at a higher price. We sometimes pay our subcontractors and suppliers before our customers pay us for the related services. If customers fail to pay us and we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed or pay our suppliers for goods received, we could suffer an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\nWe will be exposed to liabilities that are unique to the services we provide. While we intend to maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business. It is also not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. The failure to obtain adequate insurance coverage on terms favorable to us, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur industry is highly competitive, with a variety of larger companies with greater resources competing with us, and our failure to compete effectively could reduce the number of new contracts awarded to us or adversely affect our market share and harm our financial performance.\nThe contracts on which we bid are generally awarded through a competitive bid process, with awards generally being made to the lowest bidder, but sometimes based on other factors, such as shorter contract schedules, larger scale to complete projects or prior experience with the customer. Within our markets, we compete with many other service providers. Price is often the principal factor in determining which service provider is selected by our customers, especially on smaller, less complex projects. As a result, any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone because of their lower costs and financial return requirements. Additionally, our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in price to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position.\nSome of our competitors have already achieved greater market penetration than we have in the markets in which we compete, and some have greater financial and other resources than we do. A number of national companies in our industry are larger than we are and, if they so desire, could establish a presence in our markets and compete with us for contracts. As a result of this competition, we may need to accept lower contract margins in order to compete against competitors that have the ability to accept awards at lower prices or have a pre-existing relationship with a customer. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nMany of the customers we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change, and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers\u2019 changing needs could reduce demand for our services.\nWe derive, and anticipate that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the medical industry. This industry is subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation. Changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide. Additionally, the medical industry has been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers. Our failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are developed in any of the industries we serve or the consolidation of one or more of our significant customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFurther, our customers are regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services and other regulators. These regulators may interpret the application of their regulations in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations, either of which could reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEconomic downturns could cause capital expenditures in the industries we serve to decrease, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe demand for our services has been and may be vulnerable to general downturns in the United States economy. Our customers are affected by economic changes that decrease the need for or the profitability of their services. This can result in a decrease in the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay or cancellation of projects by our customers. As a result, some of our customers may opt to defer or cancel pending projects. A downturn in overall economic conditions also affects the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and federal, state and local spending levels.\nIn general, economic uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate our customers\u2019 requirements for our services. Subject to receipt of sufficient funding, which we currently do not have, we plan to expand our sales force to enable us to grow our revenues. If economic factors in any of the regions in which we plan to expand are not favorable to the growth and development of the medical industry, we may not be able to carry out our growth strategy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOther Risks Relating to Our Company and Results of Operations\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast and not within our control.\nOur past operating results may not be accurate indicators of future performance, and you should not rely on such results to predict our future performance.\nOur operating results have fluctuated and could fluctuate in the future. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations include:\n\u25cf our ability to effectively manage our working capital;\n\u25cf our ability to satisfy customer demands in a timely and cost-effective manner; and\n\u25cf pricing and availability of labor.\nActual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements.\nTo prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:\n\u25cf contract costs and profits and revenue recognition of contract change order claims;\n\u25cf provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims;\n\u25cf recoveries of costs from subcontractors, suppliers and others;\n\u25cf valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\n\u25cf accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves; and\n\u25cf goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment.\nAt the time the estimates and assumptions are made, we believe they are accurate based on the information available. However, our actual results could differ from, and could require adjustments to, those estimates.\nWe exercise judgment in determining our provision for taxes in the United States that are subject to tax authority audit review that could result in additional tax liability and potential penalties that would negatively affect our net income.\nThe amounts we record in intercompany transactions for services, licenses, funding and other items affects our potential tax liabilities. Our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income and other taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Examinations of our tax returns could result in significant proposed adjustments and assessment of additional taxes that could adversely affect our tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe may not be able to maintain the minimum $1.00 bid price per share of our Common Stock, as required by the Nasdaq Stock Market, which could force us to implement a reverse stock split of our Common Stock.\nFrom February 17, 2022 through March 21, 2022 (22 trading days), our common stock traded below $1.00 per share, the minimum bid price per share required for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Stock Market. There is a risk that the price per share of our Common Stock trades below $1.00 for thirty consecutive days, in which case we will not be in compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market\u2019s requirements for continued inclusion, as a result of which our common stock could be subject to delisting from Nasdaq. In such an event, we would, subject to shareholder approval, implement a reverse stock split so as to increase the price per share of our common stock on a post-split adjusted basis. In such a case, there is a risk that the price of our common stock could decline on a split-adjusted basis. For example, if our common stock were trading at $.80 per share and we implemented a 5/1 reverse stock split, there is a risk that our common stock could trade below $4.00 per share on a split-adjusted basis.\nOur common stock price has fluctuated substantially, and the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile, which could result in losses to investors and litigation.\nIn addition to changes to market prices based on our results of operations and the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, the market price of and trading volume for our common stock may change for a variety of other reasons, not necessarily related to our actual operating performance. The capital markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies can be very low, which may contribute to future volatility. Recently , the average daily trading volume of our common stock has decreased. Factors that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly include:\n\u25cf the results of operating and financial performance and prospects of other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf announcements of innovations, increased service capabilities, new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts by our competitors;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, media coverage and other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf market conditions for providers of services to the medical industry;\n\u25cf lack of securities analyst coverage or speculation in the press or investment community about us or opportunities in the markets in which we compete;\n\u25cf changes in government policies in the United States;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by any securities or research analysts who track our common stock or failure of our actual results of operations to meet any such expectations;\n\u25cf dilution caused by the conversion into common stock of convertible securities or by the exercise of outstanding warrants or options;\n\u25cf market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf any lawsuit involving us, our services or our products;\n\u25cf arrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf government investigations of our business activities;\n\u25cf sales of common stock by us, our investors or members of our management team; and\n\u25cf changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters.\nAny of these factors, as well as broader market and industry factors, may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume of our common stock and could seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. This may prevent stockholders from being able to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for shares of our common stock, if at all. In addition, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company. Our involvement in any class action suit or other legal proceeding, , could divert our senior management\u2019s attention and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through common stock offerings. As of December 31, 2021 we had 11,293,030 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, of which 1,706,652 shares were restricted securities and eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated by the SEC. The sale of these shares into the open market may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,043,525 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $2.57 per share, all of which were exercisable as of such date. As of December 31, 2021, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 118,388 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.25 per share, all of which were exercisable as of such date. The market price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by our issuance of shares of our capital stock or convertible securities in connection with future acquisitions, or in connection with our financing efforts.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any earnings to finance our operations and growth. As a result, any short-term return on your investment will depend on the market price of our common stock, and only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to stockholders. The decision whether to pay dividends will be made by our board of directors in light of conditions then existing, including, but not limited to, factors such as our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, and covenants under any applicable contractual arrangements. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the market price of our common stock will likely decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts, over whom we have no control, publish about us and our business. We may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the market price for price of our common stock could decline . In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, the market analysts issue unfavorable commentary, even if it is inaccurate, or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nA failure by us to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce accurate and complete financial reports and to help prevent financial fraud. In addition, such control is required in order to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. While we have undertaken remedial steps to improve our financial reporting process, including the implementation of a firm-wide accounting information system that collects, stores and processes financial and accounting data on a consolidated basis for use in meeting our reporting obligations, our internal control over financial reporting has not been effective . For the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not have effective controls over financial reporting. Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls related to deficiency in our ability to have proper segregation of duties.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls or fail to correct material weaknesses in such controls noted by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, we could again fail to meet our obligations to report our operating results accurately and completely and our continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market could be jeopardized. We have implemented a policy whereby any external communications need to be reviewed and approved by a member of our Board of Directors, as well as our outside legal counsel.\nComplying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies will increase our costs and the demands on management and could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we will incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we do not manage our planned growth effectively, our revenue, business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur future expansion strategy could include possible acquisitions of other SaaS companies. We may not be able to identify, secure and manage future acquisitions successfully. The acquisition of any future businesses may require a greater than anticipated investment of operational and financial resources as we seek to institute uniform standards and controls across acquired businesses. Acquisitions may also result in the diversion of management and resources, increases in administrative costs, including those relating to the assimilation of new employees, and costs associated with any financings undertaken in connection with such acquisitions. We cannot assure you that any acquisition we undertake, including those we have already made, will be successful. Future growth will also place additional demands on our management, sales, and marketing resources, and may require us to hire and train additional employees. We will need to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate our growth, and we may not have the resources to do so in the time frames required. The failure to manage any future growth effectively will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may explore acquiring additional companies and such acquisitions may subject us to additional unknown risks.\nWe may make future acquisitions of SaaS or other companies in markets that we do not serve now. We may not be able to reach agreements with such companies on favorable terms or at all. In completing acquisitions, we will rely upon the representations and warranties and indemnities made by the sellers with respect to each acquisition as well as our own due diligence investigation. We cannot assure you that such representations and warranties will be true and correct or that our due diligence will uncover all materially adverse facts relating to the operations and financial condition of the acquired companies or their businesses. To the extent that we are required to pay for undisclosed obligations of an acquired company, or if material misrepresentations exist, we may not realize the expected economic benefit from such acquisition and our ability to seek legal recourse from the seller may be limited.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was goodwill of $8,366,467. We evaluate goodwill at least annually, and will do so more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Many of the assumptions and estimates that we make in order to estimate the fair value of our intangible assets directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, and the discount rates applied to expected cash flows. We are able to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for testing. To avoid undue influence, we have set criteria that are followed in making assumptions and estimates. The determination of whether goodwill or acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting unit. Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets.\nAny future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of indebtedness and increased amortization expense.\nAny future acquisitions are likely to result in issuances of equity securities, which will be dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders, and may involve the incurrence of debt, which will require us to maintain cash flows sufficient to make payments of principal and interest, the assumption of known and unknown liabilities, and the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the acquisition of SCWorx resulted in a change of control of our company involving the issuance of 5,263,158 shares of common stock and 190,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, convertible into 500,000 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment), and the issuance of warrants to purchase an additional 250,000 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $5.70 per share.\nWe may become involved in litigation which could harm the value of our business.\nBecause of the nature of our business and the exit from lines of business, there is a risk of litigation. Any litigation could cause us to incur substantial expenses whether or not we prevail, which would reduce the capital available for our operations.\nPlease refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed description of the pending legal actions and investigations.\nEconomic uncertainty impacts our business and financial results, and a renewed recession could materially affect us in the future.\nPeriods of economic slowdown or recession could lead to a reduction in demand for our software and services, which in turn would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position. Our business will be dependent upon business discretionary spending and therefore is affected by business confidence as well as the future performance of the United States and global economies. As a result, our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions.\nWe depend on the services of key executives and consultants, and the loss of these persons could materially harm our business and our strategic direction if we were unable to replace them with persons of equal experience and capabilities.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management and other personnel. We cannot prevent members of senior management/consultants from terminating their employment with us even if we have an employment or consulting agreement with them. Losing the services of members of senior management/consultants could materially harm our business until a suitable replacement is found, and such replacement may not have equal experience and capabilities. We have not purchased life insurance covering any members of our senior management.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete effectively, especially against competitors with greater financial resources or marketplace presence.\nWe face competition from other SaaS companies. Many of the companies with which we will compete have greater financial and technical resources than are available to us. Our failure to compete effectively could result in a significant loss of customers, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe need additional capital to support our operations and the growth of our business, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nIn order for us to grow and execute our business plan successfully, we require additional financing which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If such financing is available, it may be dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders. Failure to obtain financing will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\nIf we fail to meet the continued listing standards and corporate governance requirements for Nasdaq Capital Market companies, we may be subject to de-listing.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain this listing, we are required to comply with various continued listing standards, including corporate governance requirements, set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. These standards and requirements include, but are not limited to, maintaining a minimum bid price for our common stock, as well as having a majority of our Board members qualify as independent. If we fail to meet any one of these requirements for an extended period of time, we will be subject to possible de-listing.\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock and our ability to grow our business.\nThere has been limited trading in our common stock, and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will either develop or be maintained. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to enter the market periodically in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or that our share price will appreciate over time.\nOur stock price has been volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf regulatory developments; and\n\u25cf economic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe periodic availability of shares for sale upon the expiration of any statutory holding period or lockup agreements, could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d, in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWe may be unable to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Our inability to protect our tradenames, service marks and other intellectual property rights from infringement, piracy, counterfeiting or other unauthorized use could negatively affect our business. If we fail to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose an important advantage in the market in which we compete. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to help us maintain our position in the market and our competitive advantages. Monitoring unauthorized uses of and enforcing our intellectual property rights can be difficult and costly. Legal intellectual property actions are inherently uncertain and may not be successful, and may require a substantial resources and management attention.\nWe currently host our solution, serve our customers, and support our operations in the United States through an agreement with a third party hosting and infrastructure provider, Rackspace. We incorporate standard IT security measures, including but not limited to; firewalls, disaster recovery, backup, etc.\nCircumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we seek protection of our marks or our copyrighted works. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights may harm our business or our ability to compete.\nChanges in laws, regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to the laws, regulations and other requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to these laws could have a material adverse impact on the revenue, profit or the operation of our business.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or security breaches of confidential customer information or personal employee information could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various information technology systems and data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various other software applications used throughout our operations. Disruptions in these systems could have an adverse impact on our operations. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in our business operations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of infiltration or data theft. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage information technology systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect or prevent over long periods of time. Moreover, the hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of our information systems. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud or deception aimed at our employees, contractors or temporary staff. In the event that the security of our information systems is compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated, and system disruptions could occur. Any such misappropriation or disruption could cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to a loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages.\nOur current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance.\nWe believe we maintain insurance coverage that is customary for businesses of our size and type; however, we may be unable to insure against certain types of losses or claims, or the cost of such insurance may be prohibitive. For example, although we carry insurance for breaches of our computer network security, there can be no assurance that such insurance will cover all potential losses or claims or that the dollar limits of such insurance will be sufficient to provide full coverage against all losses or claims. Uninsured losses or claims, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. Our Insurance policies may also be subject to substantial deductibles/retentions.\nWe may be required to pay for the defense of our clients, officers, or directors in accordance with certain indemnification provisions.\nOur company provides indemnification of varying scope to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our services. In accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for guarantees, we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnification. Management considers such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, no such claims have been filed against our company and, as a result, no liability has been recorded in our financial statements.\nAs permitted under Delaware law, our company has agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our company\u2019s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce our financial exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any such payments.\nPlease refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed description of the various actions and investigations for which we are obligated to indemnify our officers and directors.", "PERMNO": 16376, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "WORX"}
