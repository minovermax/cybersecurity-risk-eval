{"cik": "34067", "company": "DMC Global Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of material factors, events, and uncertainties that make our business and an investment in our securities subject to risk. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in\ncircumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nRisk Factors Related to DynaEnergetics\nDemand for DynaEnergetics\u2019 products is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. Decreases or expected decreases in oil and gas prices and reduced expenditures in the oil and gas industry could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for the majority of our products depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Continued low oil and gas prices have resulted in reduced North American completion activity and lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry. This has resulted in reduced cash flows for our customers, which are further exacerbated by the increasing pressure being placed on E&P companies by investors to reduce their cost of operations. If these trends continue or worsen, we would expect continued reduced or delayed oil and gas exploration and production spending, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, all of which could result in reduced demand for our products, downward pressure on selling prices for our products and decreased revenues and profits. These effects have had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe prices for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic, business and regulatory conditions;\n\u2022the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other oil producing companies to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022oil and gas production levels in the U.S. and by other non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022the level of excess production capacity;\n\u2022speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022government initiatives to restrict oil and gas drilling or development or promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment regarding the same;\n\u2022political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest;\n\u2022the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022access to potential resources;\n\u2022changes in governmental policies and subsidies;\n\u2022the costs of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022weather conditions.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically been extremely cyclical. However, there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas or for our products and services will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near or medium term. Continued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry generally may have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nFailure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customers demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. Factors that can impact our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements include the short-term nature of many customers\u2019 commitments, our customers\u2019 ability to reschedule, cancel and modify orders with little or no notice and without significant penalty, the accuracy of our customers\u2019 forecasts, and seasonal or cyclical trends in customers' industries.\nTo ensure availability of our products, particularly for our largest customers, we may start manufacturing our relevant products based on our customers\u2019 forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may never materialize or which may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.\nConversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contract manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.\nFailure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.\nOur industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction which require companies to adjust to customers\u2019 needs and market demands. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, we may find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business and our profitability could suffer as a result.\nPeriods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors negatively affecting particular markets require us to assess whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entails short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results and result in restructuring charges.\nExpansions, including the transfer of operations to other facilities or the construction of new manufacturing facilities, include the risk of additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. If we are unable to effectively manage our expansion projects or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Risks of future expansions include:\n\u2022difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans;\n\u2022the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value;\n\u2022challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs;\n\u2022additional fixed or other costs, or selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by the new business;\n\u2022a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions;\n\u2022increased debt levels and borrowing costs;\n\u2022strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources; and\n\u2022inability to locate sufficient employees or management talent to support the expansion.\nConsolidation of our customers and competitors may impact our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry has experienced periods of consolidation in the past, and we expect consolidations to increase as the industry deals with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impacts on oil and gas supply and demand. Industry consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers, the loss of customers, or consolidated entities using size and purchasing power to seek pricing or other concessions, which may lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, recent, pending and future mergers, combinations and consolidations amongst our competitors could result in existing competitors increasing their market share or improving their relative financial strength, which may result in stronger competitors. As a result, industry consolidation may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other companies in our industry.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. DynaEnergetics competes with a broad spectrum of companies that produce and market perforating services and products. Many of these companies are large national and multi-national companies, including the oil and natural gas industry\u2019s largest oilfield service providers. These companies have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. To remain competitive, DynaEnergetics must continue to provide innovative products and maintain an excellent reputation for value, quality, on-time delivery, and safety. If we fail to compete successfully against our competition, we may be unable to maintain acceptable sales levels, prices and margins for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe market for our products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and enhanced product offerings. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations and the value of our intellectual property could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to NobelClad\nNobelClad\u2019s business is dependent on sales to a limited number of customers in cyclical markets and our results are affected by the price of metals.\nNobelClad revenues are affected both by the demand for NobelClad\u2019s explosion-welded cladding services and the base price of metal used in explosion-welded cladding operations. The explosion-welded cladding market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a limited number of heavy industries, including oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, rail car manufacturing, power generation, and industrial refrigeration. These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and an economic slowdown in one or all of these industries-whether due to traditional cyclicality, general economic conditions or other factors-could impact capital expenditures within that industry. In addition, metals prices affect the demand for cladded products and our margins. Higher metal prices increase demand by making it more economical for customers to use cladding on less-expensive metal than using solid metal plates. Higher metal prices also lead to higher sales (in terms of dollars rather than square meters of cladding) and generally higher margins for NobelClad. We have experienced a significant decline in the demand for clad products in recent years due in part to a low-metals price environment. If demand or metals prices do not increase or decline further, our sales would be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur backlog figures may not accurately predict future sales.\nWe use backlog to predict our anticipated future sales. Our year-end backlog was $39.9 million, $31.7 million, and $29.9 million at the end of fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We define \u201cbacklog\u201d at any given point in time to consist of all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time. We expect to fill most items of backlog within the following 12 months. However, since orders may be rescheduled or canceled and a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a small number of customers, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. Moreover, we cannot be sure of when during the future 12-month period we will be able to recognize revenue corresponding to our backlog nor can we be certain that revenues corresponding to our backlog will not fall into periods beyond the 12-month horizon.\nThere is a limited availability of sites suitable for cladding operations.\nOur cladding process involves the detonation of large amounts of explosives. As a result, the sites where we perform cladding must meet certain criteria, including adequate distance from densely populated areas, specific geological characteristics, and the ability to comply with local noise and vibration abatement regulations in conducting the process. Our shooting sites in Pennsylvania and in Dillenburg, Germany are located in mines. Access to our Dillenburg mine is subject to a lease that expires in 2022, and if we are unable to negotiate a suitable extension of the lease, this could impact our operations. If a mine were seriously damaged, we might not be able to locate a suitable replacement site in a timely manner to continue our\noperations. In addition, our Pennsylvania shooting site is subleased under an arrangement pursuant to which we provide certain contractual services to the sub-landlord. The efforts to identify alternative suitable sites and obtain permits for using the sites from local government agencies can be time-consuming and may not be successful. In addition, we could experience difficulty in obtaining or renewing permits because of resistance from residents in the vicinity of existing or proposed sites. The failure to obtain required governmental approvals or permits could limit our ability to expand our cladding business in the future, and the failure to maintain such permits or satisfy other conditions to use the sites would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers of competitive products.\nOur explosion-welded clad products compete on a worldwide basis with explosion-welded clad products made by other manufacturers in the clad metal business and with products manufactured using other technologies. We see competition from one large well-known clad supplier and from a growing number of smaller companies with explosion welded clad manufacturing capability in China and India. Explosion-welded clad products also compete with products manufactured by roll bond and weld overlay cladding processes. The technical and commercial niches of each cladding process are well understood within the industry and vary from one world market location to another and at different metal prices. We focus on reliability, product quality, on-time delivery performance, and low-cost manufacturing to minimize the potential of future competitive threats. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain our competitive position.\nCustomers have the right to change orders until products are completed.\nCustomers have the right to change orders after they have been placed. If orders are changed, the extra expenses associated with the change usually will be passed on to the customer. However, because a change in an order may delay completion of the project, recognition of income for the project may also be delayed. Additionally, any errors or changes as to specifications or significant changes in pricing or availability of materials may cause cost overruns and delays in completion of projects. If we fail to meet delivery schedules, we may be required to pay damages or may risk loss of an order, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not maintain a reserve fund for warranty or defective products claims. Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a large claim or a significant number of warranty claims.\nOur product warranties against technical defects of our clad products vary depending on our purchase orders with customers. The warranties require us to repair or replace defective products and may require the payment of a certain percentage of the purchase price as liquidated damages for our failure to meet the specified product specifications and delivery requirements. In addition, our clad products are often used as part of larger projects or are used in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property or equipment. In the event of an actual or alleged product defect, we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims. We cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover any or all liabilities incurred. We have not established any reserve funds for potential warranty claims since historically we have experienced few warranty claims for our products and the costs associated with our warranty claims have been low. If we experience an increase in warranty claims or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to our Businesses Generally\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impacts have had, and are likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments to contain the spread of the virus, have resulted in a significant reduction in international and US economic activity. In the oil and gas industry, geopolitical events that increased the supply of low priced oil to the global market occurred at the same time that demand weakened due to the worldwide effects of the pandemic, leading to a collapse in oil prices in March 2020. These events together adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas and caused significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets. These impacts affected the demand for DynaEnergetics\u2019 products and significantly delayed certain NobelClad projects and orders. Other effects of the pandemic have included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and net income effects; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production activities; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; supply chain disruptions, employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; workforce fluctuations in response to activity declines and increases; and temporary closures of our\nfacilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers. This period of extreme economic disruption, low oil prices and reduced demand for our products has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine distribution. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.\nOur operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:\n\u2022political, social and economic instability;\n\u2022civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war, other armed conflict, and sanctions;\n\u2022public health crises and catastrophic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022inflation;\n\u2022currency fluctuations, devaluations, conversion, or repatriation restrictions; and\n\u2022expropriation and nationalization of our assets;\n\u2022confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n\u2022theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property;\n\u2022limitations on extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022limitations or disruptions to our markets or operations, restrictions on payments, or limitations on the movement of funds;\n\u2022increased tariffs;\n\u2022trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions;\n\u2022unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws;\n\u2022deprivation of contract rights; and\n\u2022the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.\nOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results caused by various factors at both NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. At NobelClad, quarterly sales and operating results depend on the volume and timing of the orders in our backlog as well as bookings during the quarter. At DynaEnergetics, the level of demand from our customers is impacted by oil and gas prices as well as a variety of other factors and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Significant portions of our operating expenses are fixed, and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs. If sales do not meet our expectations in any given period, the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock.\nWe are exposed to potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of many of our operating subsidiaries.\nMany of our operating subsidiaries conduct business in euros, Canadian dollars, or other foreign currencies. Sales made in currencies other than U.S. dollars accounted for 17%, 12%, and 21% of total sales for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of any of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience foreign currency translation (gains) losses with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. In addition, our company and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we or they enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or their respective functional currencies. For example, DynaEnergetics Europe's functional currency is euros, but its sales often occur in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. In addition, we are exposed\nto foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries\u2019 assets and liabilities and to the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of equity. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk is the euro, due to the percentage of our U.S. dollar revenue that is derived from countries where the euro is the functional currency. We use foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities of one month, to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated asset and liability account balances. These hedge transactions relate to our operating entities with significant economic exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Our primary economic exposures include the U.S. dollar to the euro, the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar, and the euro to the U.S. Dollar. Since the underlying balance sheet account balances being hedged can fluctuate significantly throughout our monthly hedge periods, our hedging program cannot fully protect against foreign currency fluctuations.\nDisruptions or delays involving our suppliers or increases in prices for the components, raw materials and parts that we obtain from our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. In some instances, we purchase components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, military activity, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a pandemic or other widespread illness (such as COVID-19), contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, transportation disruptions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers\u2019 operations and performance, which could, in turn, lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us and disrupt our operations. Although we have been able to manage supply chain impacts through the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been experiencing longer lead times for certain materials. Continued or increasing lockdown orders or a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions could cause additional global supply disruptions. If we experience further supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe terms of our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, the breach of any of which could result in acceleration of payment of our credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an outstanding balance of approximately $11.8 million on our syndicated credit agreement. This agreement includes various covenants and restrictions and certain of these relate to the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the mortgaging, pledging or disposing of major assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis. A breach of any of these covenants could impair our ability to borrow and could result in acceleration of our obligations to repay our debt, if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from our lenders. In June 2020, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that, among other things, waived our debt service coverage ratio for the quarters ending September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of the credit agreement, as amended, and our other loan agreements. Any failure to remain in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default, which would, absent a waiver or amendment, require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities.\nWe are dependent on a relatively small number of large projects and customers for a significant portion of our net sales.\nA significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of projects and customers; therefore, the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis, to receive payment for such services in a timely manner, or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities. We attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving commercial execution and product quality, delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price. We expect to continue to depend upon our principal customers for a significant portion of our sales, although our principal customers may not continue to purchase products and services from us at current levels, if at all. The loss of one or more major customers or a change in their buying patterns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe depend on a limited number of significant customers, and the loss of one or more significant customers or the failure of a customer to pay outstanding amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations. In most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to the risk that our customers will delay payment of or fail to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets and rising interest rates. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry.\nSteel plate and steel pipe are key materials used our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics\u2019 businesses. The steel industry is very cyclical and is affected significantly by supply and demand factors, general economic conditions and other factors such as worldwide production capacity, fluctuations in steel imports/exports, tariffs and quotas. Continued low metals prices over the last ten years have had an adverse effect on the U.S. steel industry and on our NobelClad business, and future economic uncertainty or a prolonged period of stagnation in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTariffs imposed by the U.S. government and related counter tariffs have increased our costs, limited the availability of metals and may lead to further trade conflicts.\nIn 2018, the U.S. announced tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imported from countries where we typically source metals. These tariffs were met with retaliatory tariffs from certain countries and increased, broader tariffs were levied by the U.S. on targeted countries, including China. The tariffs impacted the cost of the importation of steel, which we utilize in our steel plate and steel pipe, key materials in our NobelClad and DynaEnergetics businesses. Though in many cases we have been able to source metals from domestic suppliers, some materials are only available from sources subject to tariffs. The cost of domestic steel and aluminum has also increased, along with the price of delivery, and the availability of certain materials has been limited. These increased costs have increased the price of our products to our customers and, in some instances, affected our ability to be competitive. For our NobelClad business, this impacts our ability to compete on international projects and negatively impacts U.S. fabricators, which are the primary consumers of NobelClad products. Although some of these tariffs have been subsequently reduced or eliminated, as occurred in connection with the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), many tariffs continue to exist and new tariffs have been and may be imposed at any time. The prolonged duration of tariffs, the imposition of additional tariffs and the risk of potential broader global trade conflicts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our current operations.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees. The loss of services of certain of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms, if at all, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA failure in our information technology systems or those of third parties, including those caused by security breaches, cyber-attacks or data protection failures, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and banking information and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, theft, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor our outsourcing strategy, third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition, we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and loss of business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business processes functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risks related to data security, which could result in monetary and reputational damages. In addition, our ability to receive services from third party providers may be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, and unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies. As a result, our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our customers and employees. In particular, the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which contains numerous requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of E.U.-based data subjects. We are subject to the GDPR with respect to our E.U. operations and employees. The GDPR and similar laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. In particular, as the E.U. member states reframe their national legislation to harmonize with the GDPR, we will need to monitor compliance with all relevant E.U. member states' laws and regulations, including where permitted derogations from the GDPR are introduced. In addition, the states of California and Colorado have recently enacted data privacy laws, and such laws may be enacted in other states or at the U.S. federal level.\nThe GDPR, any resultant changes in E.U. member states' national laws and regulations, and existing or new U.S. state or federal data privacy laws and regulations may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. This increase in compliance obligations could also lead to an increase in compliance costs which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, under the GDPR penalties for noncompliance can be imposed up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of a firm's global annual revenue. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that we seek to expand our business through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations.\nFrom time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to increase shareholder return by increasing our total available markets, expanding our existing operations and, potentially, generating synergies. The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u2022obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially DMC\u2019s shareholders;\n\u2022maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business;\n\u2022implementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and\n\u2022to the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.\nFor example, our due diligence process may not reveal all liabilities associated with a potential acquisition, and this could result in us incurring unanticipated losses after the acquisition is completed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and impact the value of our securities.\nWe depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business. If we fail to do so, our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to\nthe fair presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Even effective internal controls have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or a deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their execution, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In the event that our current internal control practices deteriorate, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and investor confidence and the market price of our stock may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. Managing or defending such legal proceedings may result in substantial legal fees, expenses and costs and diversion of management resources. If material litigation is brought against us in the future, a decision adverse to DMC could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur international operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.\nThe internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships.\nThe use of explosives in our manufacturing processes and products subject us to additional environmental, health and safety laws and any accidents or injuries could subject us to significant liabilities.\nDynaEnergetics\u2019 uses explosive materials in its manufacturing processes and products. NobelClad\u2019s manufacturing process involves the detonation of large quantities of explosives. The use of explosives is an inherently dangerous activity. These activities subject us to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations including guidelines and regulations for the purchase, manufacture, handling, transport, storage and use of explosives issued by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation; the Safety Library Publications of the Institute of Makers of Explosive; and similar guidelines of their European counterparts. In Germany, the transport, storage and use of explosives is governed by a permit issued under the Explosives Act (Sprengstoffgesetz).\nDespite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our employee training programs, the storage and handling of explosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such an explosion could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nDemand for our products could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment.\nRegulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the United States, the E.U., and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters. Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products.\nIn addition, some international, national, state and local governments and agencies have also adopted laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on directly limiting the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing. The U.S. federal government has also recently taken significant actions to restrict or suspend the issuance of oil and gas leases on federal lands, which could have a significant impact on future drilling, completion activity and production. These or similar legislation or regulatory changes could limit oil and gas development, lead to operational delays and increased costs for our customers, and therefore reduce demand for our products. Such reductions in demand for our products may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased negative investor sentiment toward oil and gas and preference for assets outside of traditional energy sectors could lead to higher capital costs for our customers and reduced investment in fossil fuels, thereby reducing demand for our products. Such preferences could also impact our ability to obtain acceptable debt or equity financing on attractive terms or at all and could negatively impact our stock price over time. Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.\nLiabilities for natural resource damages, cleanup costs, and other damages under environmental, health and safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities, substantial civil or criminal liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation in the United States and the other countries where our manufacturing facilities are located including those covering hazardous materials. We and all of our activities in the United States are subject to noise abatement and air emissions regulations, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, regulations issued and laws enforced by the labor and employment departments of the U.S. and the states in which we conduct business, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In Germany, we and all our activities are subject to various safety and environmental regulations of the federal state which are enforced by the local authorities, including the Federal Act on Emission Control (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The Federal Act on Emission Control permits are held by companies jointly owned by DynaEnergetics and the other companies that are located at the Troisdorf manufacturing site and are for an indefinite period of time. The Dillenburg, Germany facility is\noperated based on a specific permit granted by the local mountain authority and must be renewed every three years. Any failure to comply with current and future environmental and safety regulations could subject us to significant liabilities. Any actual or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our facilities or substantial civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our facilities and at third party waste disposal sites, even when such contamination was caused by a predecessor and even when the actions resulting in the contamination were lawful at the time. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety matters may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in or interpretation of tax law control could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S and have significant intercompany transactions between our affiliates. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions from time to time. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. The final resolution of any audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nOur failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining our competitive position and recognizing the value of our investments in technology and intellectual property in our existing and future products. We rely on trade secret protection for certain aspects of our technology, in part through confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. Through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property documentation and other proprietary technology information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, former employees, consultants or third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights.\nWe also actively pursue patent protection for our proprietary technology and intellectual property. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be respected by third parties. In addition, our competitors may be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, and this could have a similar effect on our competitive position.\nIntellectual property litigation and threats of litigation are becoming more common in the oilfield services industry. We are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation, in the United States or abroad, to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets and know-how. These actions commonly result in actions by the affected third parties to establish the invalidity of our patents. While we intend to prosecute these actions vigorously, there is no guarantee of success, and such effort takes significant financial and time resources from the Company. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If our patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by a court or USPTO decision, we could be prevented from pursuing certain litigation matters or licensing the invalidated or limited portion of such patents. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our future, expected revenue. Patent litigation, if necessary or when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.\nWe are currently involved and may in the future be involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others\u2019 patents or other intellectual property rights. We have an active \"freedom to operate\" review process for our technology, but there is no assurance that future infringement claims will not be asserted. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core businesses even if we are ultimately successful. In the event of any adverse ruling in any intellectual property litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license from the third party claiming infringement with royalty payment obligations by us. We also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products, which may increase our costs. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our competitive position, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to general stock market conditions and/or a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:\n\u2022changes in the oil and gas, industrial, or infrastructure markets;\n\u2022operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022developments in our business or in our business sectors generally;\n\u2022regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u2022announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation regarding our industries, business or trading activity;\n\u2022significant amounts of short selling, the perception that short sales could occur and other speculative trading activity;\n\u2022activism by any large stockholder or group of stockholders;\n\u2022changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, including volatility in foreign exchange rates, tariffs and stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations, and federal government actions or shutdowns.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and these fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the trading prices of some companies\u2019 stock have recently exhibited significant volatility, including rapid price and daily volume increases as a result of strong and atypical interest from retail investors, reportedly due in part to a high volume of social media posts, followed by significant declines in the trading prices of the stock. Our stock is historically subject to significant fluctuations, which can be caused by a myriad of known or unknown reasons. While an increase in our stock price may be attributable, in whole or in part, to market developments such as increased commodity prices and/or improving conditions in our core markets, we cannot rule out the possibility that it resulted in whole or in part from market phenomena such as a surge in investor interest or a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d, in which investors are driving up our share price in hopes that other investors holding short positions are required to buy shares at higher prices to cover their positions. In this case, those market phenomena could reverse themselves at any time, leading to a rapid and substantial decline in the price of our stock.\nHolders of our common stock do not currently receive dividends and our dividend may not be reinstated in the future.\nOur Board of Directors suspended our dividend in April 2020 in order to preserve liquidity in light of the sharp reduction in demand for DynaEnergetics products and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors declares out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and there can be no assurance as to whether the Board will reinstate a dividend in the future.", "PERMNO": 33823, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "BOOM"}
