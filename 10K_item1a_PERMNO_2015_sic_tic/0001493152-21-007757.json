{"cik": "890821", "company": "Enveric Biosciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are dependent on the success of our prospective product candidates, which are in early stages of development, and there can be no assurances that any such prospects will reach a particular stage in development, receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nOur success will depend on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our prospective product candidates through our development programs. We intend to develop at least three product candidates by undergoing the long, costly clinical-trial process for each candidate under an Investigational New Drug Application (\u201cIND\u201d) and, eventually, obtaining FDA approval under a New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) before proceeding to market. In order to proceed with development of our pharmaceutical product candidates under the NDA pathway, we must obtain the FDA\u2019s approval of our IND application and conduct preclinical and clinical trials in compliance with the applicable IND regulations, clinical-study protocols, and other applicable regulations and related requirements. We may never be able to develop products which are commercially viable or receive regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere. There can be no assurance that the FDA or any other regulatory authority will approve of our current or future product candidates.\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or \u201cFDCA,\u201d and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The process required by the FDA before a new drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\u25cf Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices and other applicable regulations;\n\u25cf Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;\n\u25cf Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA\u2019s current good clinical practices, or GCPs, which sufficiently demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended uses;\n\u25cf Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or an NDA, for a new drug product;\n\u25cf Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is to be produced to assess compliance with the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practice standards, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug\u2019s or biologic\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity;\n\u25cf Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or biologics license application; and\n\u25cf FDA review and, potentially, approval of the NDA.\nThe lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. There can be no certainty that approvals will be granted.\nWe may encounter difficulties that may delay, suspend or scale back our efforts to advance additional early research programs through preclinical development and IND application filings and into clinical development.\nWe intend to advance early research programs through preclinical development and to file an IND application for human clinical trials evaluating the prospective product candidates in our pipeline. The preparation and submission of IND applications requires rigorous and time-consuming preclinical testing, the results of which must be sufficiently documented to establish, among other things, the toxicity, safety, manufacturing, chemistry and clinical protocol of the product candidates. We may experience unforeseen difficulties that could delay or otherwise prevent us from successfully executing our current development strategy. In addition, our ability to complete and file certain IND applications may depend on the support of our partners and the timely performance of their obligations under relevant collaboration agreements. If our relevant partners are not able to perform such obligations, or if they otherwise delay the progress, we may not be able to prepare and file the intended IND applications on a timely basis or at all. Any delay, suspension or reduction of our efforts to pursue our preclinical and IND strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause our share price to decline.\nThe novel coronavirus could adversely impact our business, including our current plans for product development, as well as any currently ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and any future studies or other development or commercialization activities.\nSince COVID-19 was initially reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, it has spread globally, including countries in which we are currently, or plans to, conduct preclinical or clinical studies or other development activities. There is significant uncertainty as to the likely effects of this pandemic. As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues, we will likely experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, including, but not limited to, our current or future preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory progress, or any other development or commercialization activities, including (among others):\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others;\n\u25cf limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u25cf delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials, such as investigational drug product used in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 outbreak which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u25cf delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u25cf delay in the timing of interactions with the FDA due to absenteeism by federal employees or by the diversion of their efforts and attention to approval of other therapeutics or other activities related to COVID-19; and\n\u25cf refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the United States.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt our operations due to absenteeism by infected or ill members of management or other employees, or absenteeism by members of management and other employees who elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or laboratory facilities, or due to quarantines. COVID-19 could also impact members of our board of directors, resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors, and making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full board of directors or our committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nWe have significant and increasing liquidity needs and may require additional funding.\nResearch and development, management and administrative expenses and cash used for operations will continue to be significant and may increase substantially in the future in connection with new and continued research and development initiatives and our pursuit of IND authorization(s) for some or all of our product candidates, as is required to initiate clinical trials in human subjects in the United States. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, continue to conduct clinical trials to support potential regulatory approval of marketing applications, and to fund commercialization of our current and future product candidates.\nThe amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the scope, number, initiation, progress, timing, costs, design, duration, delays (if any), and results of preclinical and clinical studies for our current or future product candidates;\n\u25cf the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory reviews, approvals or other actions to meet regulatory requirements established by the FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of revenue generated or received, including any revenue from grants or other sources;\n\u25cf the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other product development programs;\n\u25cf costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our current and future product candidates;\n\u25cf the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf personnel, facilities and equipment requirements; and\n\u25cf the terms and timing of any additional collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish.\nWhile we expect to fund our future capital requirements from financing arrangements, we cannot assure you that any such financing arrangements will be available to it on favorable terms, or at all. Further, even if we can raise funds from financing arrangements, the amounts raised may not be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements.\nWe depend on our current key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success depends on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. We are highly dependent on our current management and scientific personnel, including David Johnson, Avani Kanubaddi, and Dr. Robert Wilkins. The inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. Due to the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nThere has been limited study on the effects of medical cannabinoids, and future clinical research studies may lead to conclusions that dispute or conflict with our understanding and belief regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing, and social acceptance of cannabinoids.\nResearch relating to the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, and dosing of cannabinoids remains in relatively early stages. There have been few clinical trials on the benefits of cannabinoids conducted by us or by others. Future research and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to statements contained in the articles, reports and studies We have relied on, or could reach different or negative conclusions regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing or other facts and perceptions related to cannabinoids, which could adversely affect social acceptance of cannabinoids and the demand for our product candidates.\nWe expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than us.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. The industry continues to expand and evolve as an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than us. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than us in the development of pharmaceutical products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. In addition, our future product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with product offerings from large and well-established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than us or our collaboration partners have. Other companies with greater resources than we may announce similar plans in the future. In addition, there are other non-FDA approved CBD preparations being made available from other companies, which might attempt to compete with our future product candidates. If we are unable to compete successfully, our commercial opportunities will be reduced and our business, results of operations and financial conditions may be materially harmed.\nOur current and future preclinical and clinical studies may be conducted outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from such studies to support any NDAs we may submit after completing the applicable developmental and regulatory prerequisites.\nWe are conducting, or may conduct, preclinical and/or clinical studies outside the United States. For example, we have conducted preclinical studies in Israel, and plan to conduct clinical studies for one or more product candidates in Israel or other non-U.S. countries. To the extent we do not conduct these clinical trials under an IND, the FDA may not accept data from such trials. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States that are not conducted under an IND, the FDA\u2019s acceptance of these data is subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles and all applicable FDA regulations. The trial population must also adequately represent the intended U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In general, the patient population for any clinical trials conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to market the product candidate in the United States, if approved. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon our ability to verify the data and our determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from such clinical trials, we would likely result in the need for additional trials and the completion of additional regulatory steps, which would be costly and time-consuming and could delay or permanently halt our development of our product candidates.\nBecause the results of preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, we may not have favorable results in our planned and future clinical trials.\nSuccessful development of therapeutic products is highly uncertain and is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for several reasons including:\n\u25cf preclinical study results that may show the product to be less effective than desired (e.g., the study failed to meet our primary objectives) or to have harmful or problematic side effects;\n\u25cf failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals or a delay in receiving such approvals. Among other things, such delays may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical studies, length of time to achieve study endpoints, additional time requirements for data analysis or an IND and later NDA, preparation, discussions with the FDA, an FDA request for additional preclinical or clinical data or unexpected safety or manufacturing issues;\n\u25cf manufacturing costs, pricing, or reimbursement issues or other factors that make the product not economical; and\n\u25cf the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent the product from being commercialized.\nAny positive results from our preclinical testing of our prospective product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results from planned or future clinical trials for such product candidates. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials after achieving positive results in preclinical and early clinical development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings while clinical trials were underway or safety or efficacy observations in clinical trials, including adverse events. Moreover, our interpretation of clinical data or our conclusions based on the preclinical in vitro and in vivo models may prove inaccurate, as preclinical and clinical data can be susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals. If we fail to produce positive results in our planned clinical trial for our product candidates for the treatment of GBM, or our future clinical trials, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for such product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected.\nBusiness interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our product candidates.\nLoss of our stored materials or facilities through fire, theft, or other causes could have an adverse effect on our ability to continue product development activities and to conduct our business. Even if we obtain insurance coverage to compensate us for such business interruptions, such coverage may prove insufficient to fully compensate us for the damage to our business resulting from any significant property or casualty loss.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and legal requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA, SEC or Office of Inspector General regulations, or regulations of any other applicable regulatory authority, failure to provide accurate information to the FDA or the SEC, comply with applicable manufacturing standards, other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations, report information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of confidential or protected information, including information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal pre-approval promotion of drug candidates, which could result in government investigations, enforcement actions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics and Whistleblower Policy, but employee misconduct is not always possible to identify and deter. The precautions we take to detect and prevent these prohibited activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending our Company or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur proprietary information, or that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, may be lost or we may suffer security breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we expect to collect and store sensitive data, including valuable and commercially sensitive intellectual property, clinical trial data, our proprietary business information and that of our future customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers, clinical trial subjects and employees, patients, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and our ability to conduct clinical trials, which could adversely affect our business and reputation and lead to delays in gaining regulatory approvals for our future product candidates. Although we may obtain business interruption insurance coverage in the future, our insurance might not cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nFailure of our information technology systems, including cybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur business depends on the use of information technologies. Our ability to execute our business plan and to comply with regulators\u2019 requirements with respect to data control and data integrity, depends, in part, on the uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems, or IT systems and the IT systems supplied by third-party service providers. Our IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts, natural disasters and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information. A successful cybersecurity attack or other data security incident could result in the misappropriation and/or loss of confidential or personal information, create system interruptions, or deploy malicious software that attacks our systems. It is also possible that a cybersecurity attack might not be noticed for some period of time. In addition, sustained or repeated system failures or problems arising during the upgrade of any of our IT systems that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The occurrence of a cybersecurity attack or incident could result in business interruptions from the disruption of our IT systems, or negative publicity resulting in reputational damage with our shareholders and other stakeholders and/or increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. In addition, the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information could expose us or other third-parties to regulatory fines or penalties, litigation and potential liability, or otherwise harm our business.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent it from accessing critical information or expose it to liability, which could adversely affect our business and its reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we expect to collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, credit card information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We expect to manage and maintain its applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, or viruses, breaches or interruptions due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In the future, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and European Union General Data Protection Regulation, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to process samples, provide test results, share and monitor safety data, bill payors or patients, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and may damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may vary significantly in future periods.\nWe are in the early stages of product development and expects to focus substantial efforts for, at least, the next several years on preclinical and clinical trials and other research and development activities. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidates. Our revenues, expenses and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future. We expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several years as our research, development, and preclinical and clinical study activities increase. Our financial results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, for among other reasons, due to:\n\u25cf the scope, number, progress, duration, endpoints, cost, results, and timing of our preclinical testing and clinical studies of current or potential future product candidates\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional funding to develop product candidates; and\n\u25cf delays in the commencement, enrollment and timing of clinical studies.\nA high portion of our costs are predetermined on an annual basis, due in part to our significant research and development costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect financial results in a quarter.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nOur prospective products will be subject to the various federal and state laws and regulations relating to health and safety.\nWe are in the process of developing investigational new drugs for which we intend to pursue FDA approval via the New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) process. In these product candidates, cannabinoid(s) will be the active pharmaceutical ingredient.\nIn connection with our development and future commercialization (if applicable) of the above-described prospective products, we and each contemplated product candidate are subject to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). The FDCA is intended to assure the consumer, in part, that drugs and devices are safe and effective for their intended uses and that all labeling and packaging is truthful, informative, and not deceptive. The FDCA and FDA regulations define the term \u201cdrug,\u201d in part, by reference to its intended use, as \u201carticles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease\u201d and \u201carticles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.\u201d Therefore, almost any ingested or topical or injectable product that, through its label or labeling (including internet websites, promotional pamphlets, and other marketing material), that is claimed to be beneficial for such uses will be regulated by FDA as a drug. The definition also includes components of drugs, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Drugs must generally either receive premarket approval by FDA through the NDA process or conform to a \u201cmonograph\u201d for a particular drug category, as established by FDA\u2019s Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review. If the FDA does not award premarket approval for our product candidates through the NDA process, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, delay or termination. The results of clinical trials are open to differing interpretations.\nWe currently have two potential product candidates that are in preclinical development as an investigational combination therapy for GBM and other forms of cancer and intends to pursue preclinical and clinical development for other prospective candidates as well, including, but not limited to, a candidate targeting radiodermatitis. After completing the requisite preclinical testing, IND submission, internal review board (\u201cIRB\u201d) review, and any other applicable early-development obligations, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, time consuming, and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, or at all. Failures in connection with one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing.\nRegulatory agencies may analyze or interpret the results of clinical trials differently than us. Even if the results of our clinical trials are favorable, the clinical trials for a number of our product candidates are expected to continue for several years and may take significantly longer to complete. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u25cf delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on trial design;\n\u25cf delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organization (\u201cCRO\u201d) and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf delays in opening clinical trial sites or obtaining required IRB or independent ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u25cf actual or perceived lack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials;\n\u25cf discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by trial participants or other safety issues, such as drug interactions, including those which cause confounding changes to the levels of other concomitant medications;\n\u25cf slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials;\n\u25cf difficulty in retaining subjects for the entire duration of applicable clinical studies (as study subjects may withdraw at any time due to adverse side effects from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or for any other reason;\n\u25cf delays or inability in manufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials due to regulatory and manufacturing constraints;\n\u25cf inadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or product candidate formulation;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining regulatory authorization s, such as INDs and any others that must be obtained, maintained, and/or satisfied to commence a clinical trial, including \u201cclinical holds\u201d or delays requiring suspension or termination of a trial by a regulatory agency, such as the FDA, before or after a trial is commenced;\n\u25cf changes in applicable regulatory policies and regulation, including changes to requirements imposed on the extent, nature or timing of studies;\n\u25cf delays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf uncertainty regarding proper dosing;\n\u25cf delay or failure to supply product for use in clinical trials which conforms to regulatory specification;\n\u25cf unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf failure of our CROs, or other third-party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u25cf failure by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees to comply with all applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u25cf scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n\u25cf failure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf regulatory concerns with cannabinoid products, generally, and the potential for abuse;\n\u25cf insufficient data to support regulatory approval;\n\u25cf inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; or\n\u25cf difficulty in maintaining contact with patients during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state and foreign governments in each of the U.S., European and Canadian markets, in which we plan to sell our product candidates. We must adhere to all regulatory requirements, including FDA\u2019s Good Laboratory Practice (\u201cGLP\u201d), GCP, and GMP requirements, pharmacovigilance requirements, advertising and promotion restrictions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and their European equivalents. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, including FDA pre-or post-approval requirements, then the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities could sanction our Company. Even if a drug is approved by the FDA or other competent authorities, regulatory authorities may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing trials. Any of our product candidates which may be approved in the U.S. will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import, export, advertising, promotion, sampling, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to GMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers (in the event contract manufacturers are appointed in the future) are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with GMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work will have to spend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, quality control and quality assurance. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. Similar restrictions and requirements exist in the European Union and other markets where we operate.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of the product, it may impose restrictions on that product or on us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n\u25cf issue warning letters;\n\u25cf impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf suspend regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u25cf impose restrictions on our operations, including by requiring us to enter in to a Corporate Integrity Agreement or closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, if any; or\n\u25cf seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nWe may be subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations and implementation of or changes to such healthcare laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we successfully complete the requisite preclinical and clinical testing, make the required regulatory submissions and obtain any corresponding authorizations or licenses (as applicable), fulfill all other applicable development-related regulatory obligations, and, eventually, obtain FDA approval to market one or more of our current or future product candidates in the United States, we may be subject to certain healthcare laws and regulations. In both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our future product candidates. If we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other federal, state or foreign regulations, we may be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from federal health care programs and the restructuring of our operations. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Since many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the courts, there is an increased risk that we may be found in violation of one or more of their provisions. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we are ultimately successful in our defense, will cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention away from the operation of our business. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control.\nIn some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, some European Union jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between European Union member states. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. In the European Union, the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become intense. As a result, barriers to entry of new products are becoming increasingly high and patients are unlikely to use a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government.\nWe may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, the importation of foreign products may compete with any future product that we may market, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nSpecifically in the U.S., we expect that the 2010 Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product. There have been judicial challenges to certain aspects of the ACA and numerous legislative attempts to repeal and/or replace the ACA in whole or in part, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. At this time, the full effect that the ACA will have on our business in the future remains unclear. An expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may cause general downward pressure on the prices of prescription drug products, lower reimbursements or any other product for which we obtain regulatory approval, reduce product utilization and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any of our future product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nThere is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials.\nWe have no products on the market, and our new potential cannabinoid-based drug product candidates are currently either in preclinical development or the research and discovery phase. Accordingly, none of our prospective products or investigational candidates have ever been tested in a human subject. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability with respect to our product candidates in which cannabinoids are featured as the active pharmaceutical ingredient depends on obtaining regulatory approvals for and, if approved, successfully commercializing our product candidates, either alone or with third parties. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our product candidates, we or an existing or future collaborator must conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of our product candidates.\nGenerally, there is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials. We may suffer significant setbacks in our clinical trials similar to the experience of a number of other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. Further, even if we view the results of a clinical trial to be positive, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of the data. In the event that we obtain negative results from clinical trials for product candidates or other problems related to potential chemistry, manufacturing and control issues or other hurdles occur and our future product candidates are not approved, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain financing to continue our operations, our ability to execute on our current business plan may be materially impaired, and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community might be significantly damaged. In addition, our inability to properly design, commence and complete clinical trials may negatively impact the timing and results of our clinical trials and ability to seek approvals for our drug candidates.\nThe testing, marketing and manufacturing of any new drug product for use in the United States will require approval from the FDA. We cannot predict with any certainty the amount of time necessary to obtain such FDA approval and whether any such approval will ultimately be granted. Preclinical and clinical trials may reveal that one or more products are ineffective or unsafe, in which event further development of such products could be seriously delayed or terminated. Moreover, obtaining approval for certain products may require testing on human subjects of substances whose effects on humans are not fully understood or documented. Delays in obtaining FDA or any other necessary regulatory approvals of any proposed drug and failure to receive such approvals would have an adverse effect on the drug\u2019s potential commercial success and on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that a proposed drug may be found to be ineffective or unsafe due to conditions or facts that arise after development has been completed and regulatory approvals have been obtained. In this event, we may be required to withdraw such proposed drug from the market. To the extent that our success will depend on any regulatory approvals from government authorities outside of the United States that perform roles similar to that of the FDA, uncertainties similar to those stated above will also exist.\nSerious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude, delay or limit approval of our prospective products or current or future product candidates, limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance, or cause the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed.\nIf any of our prospective products or current or future product candidates, prior to or after any approval for commercial sale, cause serious or unexpected side effects, or are associated with other safety risks such as misuse, abuse or diversion, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may deny regulatory approval of our future product candidates;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require certain labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications or limitations on the indications for use, and/or impose restrictions on distribution in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d) in connection with approval or post-approval;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval, require more onerous labeling statements, impose a more restrictive REMS, or require it to recall any product that is approved;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf our relationships with our collaboration partners may suffer;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer. The reputational risk is heightened with respect to those of our future product candidates that are being developed for pediatric indications.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that the product candidates present an unacceptable risk to participants, or if preliminary data demonstrates that our future product candidates are unlikely to receive regulatory approval or unlikely to be successfully commercialized.\nAfter completing preclinical testing and obtaining the requisite regulatory authorizations, as applicable, we may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials for any number of reasons, including if we believe that a product\u2019s use, or a person\u2019s exposure to it, may cause adverse health consequences or death. In addition, regulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Although we have never been asked by a regulatory agency, IRB or data safety monitoring board to temporarily or permanently discontinue a clinical trial, if we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of any of our future product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events may result in labeling statements such as warnings or contraindications. In addition, such events or labeling could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our future product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our collaboration partners.\nThe success of our prospective product candidates and future approved products, if any, especially those containing hemp-derived CBD, is subject to a number of constantly-evolving state and federal laws, regulations, and enforcement policies pertaining to hemp-derived CBD and/or cannabis more generally.\nThe Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, or the \u201c2018 Farm Bill,\u201d was signed into law on December 20, 2018. This 2018 Farm Bill expressly excluded \u201chemp\u201d from the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act\u2019s, as amended (the \u201cCSA\u201d)\u2019s definition of marijuana and, accordingly, declassified substances derived from or containing any part(s) of the cannabis plant containing not more than 0.3% THC on a dry-weight basis from Schedule I. In effect, the 2018 Farm Bill legalized the cultivation and commercial sale of hemp in the United States, subject to applicable state laws and regulations and applicable FDCA provisions, including any implementing regulations, as interpreted and enforced by the FDA.\nLocal, state, federal, and international hemp and CBD laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance requirements. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business regarding cannabinoid production. It is also possible that the federal government will begin strictly enforcing existing laws, which may limit the legal uses of the hemp plant and its derivatives and extracts, such as cannabinoids. we cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our activities in the cannabis industry.\nIn addition, the 2018 Farm Bill did not alter the FDA\u2019s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, including cannabinoids, under the FDCA. Hemp products, including cannabinoids, that qualify as drugs, food, dietary supplements, veterinary products, and cosmetics, for example, are subject to regulation by the FDA. Following passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA reaffirmed its enforcement authority and reiterated the requirement that a product containing CBD or other cannabinoid(s) (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit implicitly or explicitly attributed to, or based on, the presence of the cannabinoid as an ingredient, or any other health/medical claim, must be approved by the FDA for its intended use(s) before it may be introduced into interstate commerce. Our prospective product candidates are currently intended for development under an IND and, eventually, approval under an NDA, which will mean that, if approved, we can market such products with claims about their proven medical benefits for the applicable indications for use to the extent consistent with the product\u2019s NDA.\nWhile we believe that the 2018 Farm Bill and analogous state legislation has reduced the amount of DEA oversight of hemp-derived cannabinoids, this is a rapidly evolving area of U.S. law and substantial uncertainty remains as to the future of federal and state regulation of cannabinoid products. In addition, the FDA has approved only one natural cannabis-based drug product, which contains only hemp-derived CBD. There can be no assurance that our product candidates containing cannabinoids (as the active drug ingredient(s)) will be similarly approved for commercialization in the United States at any time in the near or distant future. Any regulations the FDA issues relating to the sale, marketing, and/or other activities involving cannabinoid or certain cannabinoid-containing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding future state regulations and the continuing barriers that still exist for cannabinoids in certain product categories due to FDA regulation, it is unknown what impact the removal of hemp from the CSA, and any resulting commercialization of hemp products, may have on our business.\nCosts associated with compliance with numerous laws and regulations could impact our financial results. In addition, we could become subject to increased enforcement and/or litigation risks associated with the CBD industry.\nThe manufacture, labeling and distribution of products containing CBD or other cannabinoids is governed by various federal, state and local agencies. To the extent we are able to successfully commercialize any of our currently contemplated product candidates via the FDA\u2019s NDA approval pathway, the presence of cannabinoids as active or inactive ingredients, as applicable, may give rise to heightened regulatory scrutiny and greater risk of consumer litigation, either of which could further restrict the permissible scope of our marketing claims about such products or our ability to sell them in the United States at all. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different hemp or CBD-related regulations in jurisdictions may increase costs and/or the risk that we may violate one or more applicable regulatory requirements. If our operations, or any of our activities or prospective products, are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to the manufacture, distribution, or sale of prescription drug products, generally, and to products containing hemp or CBD, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business or our financial results.\nFailure to comply with any applicable FDA requirements, relating to CBD or otherwise, may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. Our advertising is also subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Additionally, analogous state advertising and labeling laws are often enforced by state attorneys general, and any state or federal enforcement action based on potentially misleading or deceptive advertising is often followed by costly class-action complaints under state consumer-protection laws.\nThe FDA, on its own and in collaboration with the FTC, has issued numerous warning letters to companies offering for sale of topical, oral, and other types of products containing CBD, which were not approved under the FDA\u2019s NDA process, in response to their making unsubstantiated claims on product webpages, online stores, and social media websites about the products\u2019 purported therapeutic or other drug-like benefits in connection with CBD or other cannabinoids. The FDA deemed that companies \u201cused these online platforms to make unfounded, egregious claims about their products\u2019 ability to limit, treat or cure cancer, neurodegenerative conditions, autoimmune diseases, opioid use disorder, and other serious diseases, without sufficient evidence and the legally required FDA approval.\u201d\nThe agency has continuously demonstrated its commitment to taking action against companies making medical claims about products containing CBD (as the active ingredient), as selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims can put patients and consumers at risk. The FDA does not believe CBD has been shown to be safe and effective for any therapeutic use, except as used in Epidiolex, the only new drug containing CBD that has been approved by FDA under the NDA process, which was approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. The agency\u2019s principal concern with CBD products on the market that are unlawfully claiming to treat serious medical conditions is that deceptive marketing of unproven treatments may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases. Additionally, because they are not evaluated by the FDA, there may be other ingredients that are not disclosed, which may be harmful.\nThe FDA has pledged to continue to monitor the marketplace and take enforcement action as-needed to protect the public against companies illegally selling products containing CBD as the active ingredient, claiming to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, psychiatric disorders and diabetes; illegally selling cannabis and cannabis-derived products that can put consumers at risk; and marketing and distributing such products in violation of the FDA\u2019s authorities.\nNegative public perception of hemp and cannabinoid-related businesses, misconceptions about the nature of our business and regulatory uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe believe the cannabinoid industry is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy, quality, and legality of cannabinoid, whether derived from hemp or marijuana. Consumer perception of cannabinoid products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention, and other publicity regarding the consumption of cannabinoid products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention, or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the cannabinoid market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. Our dependence upon consumer perceptions means that adverse scientific research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention, or other publicity relating to cannabinoid products, generally or any particular cannabinoid products or derivatives, in particular, regardless of merit or accuracy, could have a material adverse effect on our business, the demand for our product candidates or any products for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future. Such adverse publicity or other negative media attention could arise even if the adverse effects reportedly associated with such products resulted from consumers\u2019 failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed. Any adverse publicity or other similar occurrences affecting consumer perception may have a material adverse impact on our reputation, perception of our product candidates, our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and the commercial viability of the products for which regulatory approval is obtained in the future, if any.\nOur management will be required to devote a substantial time to comply with public company regulations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, impose various requirements on public companies, including those related to corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel must devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with these requirements will require that we incur substantial accounting and related expenses and expend significant management efforts. We will likely need to hire additional accounting and financial staff to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The costs of hiring such staff may be material and there can be no assurance that such staff will be immediately available to us. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, our business may be harmed.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Internal control over financial reporting is a process used to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 and concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to the material weakness related to segregation of duties. Specifically, due to the small size of our Company, we do not maintain sufficient segregation of duties to ensure the processing, review and authorization of all transactions including non-routine transactions. We are in the process of remediating our material weaknesses and designing an effective internal control environment.\nRemediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing material weakness or any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may be identified in the future in a timely manner, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected; our liquidity, our access to capital markets, the perceptions of our creditworthiness may be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting; our reputation may be harmed; and our stock price may decline.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position.\nWe currently hold full or limited rights to several patents as an in-licensee covering the use of CBD including with current cancer treatments, both broadly, as well as for specific cancer types. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain additional patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection (i.e., know-how), and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property of our future product candidates. The strengths of patents in the pharmaceutical field involve complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our products and technology. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents globally can be prohibitively expensive.\nOur policy is to look to patent technologies with commercial potential in jurisdictions with significant commercial opportunities. However, patent protection may not be available for some of the products or technology we are developing. If we must spend significant time and money protecting, defending or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed. We may not develop additional proprietary products that are patentable.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain. The scope and extent of patent protection for our future product candidates are particularly uncertain. Our future product candidates will be based on medicinal chemistry instead of cannabis plants. While we have sought patent protection, where appropriate, directed to, among other things, composition-of-matter for our specific formulations, their methods of use, and methods of manufacture, we do not have and will not be able to obtain composition of matter protection on these previously known CBD derivatives per se. Although we have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection in the U.S., Europe and other countries for our proprietary technologies, future product candidates, their methods of use, and methods of manufacture, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection. If any of our products is approved and marketed for an indication for which we do not have an issued patent, our ability to use our patents to prevent a competitor from commercializing a non-branded version of our commercial products for that non-patented indication could be significantly impaired or even eliminated.\nPublication of information related to our future product candidates by us or others may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to these products and product candidates. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights. In addition, any of our issued patents may be opposed and/or declared invalid or unenforceable. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may face competition from companies who attempt to create a generic product to compete with our future product candidates. We may also face competition from companies who develop a substantially similar product to our future product candidates that is not covered by any of our patents.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain additional intellectual property and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Infringement claims by third parties may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents, protect our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may face competition from companies who develop a substantially similar product to our future product candidates that is not covered by any of our intellectual property. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting, defending, and enforcing intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. There is also a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the U.S., involving patient and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. We may, from time to time, be notified of claims that we are infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties, and we cannot provide assurances that other companies will not, in the future, pursue such infringement claims against it, our commercial partners, or any third-party proprietary technologies we have licensed.\nWe may be unsuccessful in licensing additional intellectual property to develop new product candidates.\nWe may in the future seek to in-license additional intellectual property that we believe could complement or expand our product candidates or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of such licenses may cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable intellectual property. If we acquire additional intellectual property to develop new therapeutic product candidates, we may not be able to realize anticipated cost savings or synergies.\nIf third parties claim that intellectual property used by us infringes upon their intellectual property, our operating profits could be adversely affected.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the U.S., involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. We may, from time to time, be notified of claims that we are infringing upon patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties, and we cannot provide assurances that other companies will not, in the future, pursue such infringement claims against us, our commercial partners or any third-party proprietary technologies we have licensed. If we were found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property right, or if we failed to obtain or renew a license under a patent or other intellectual property right from a third party, or if a third party that we were licensing technologies from was found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property rights of another third party, we may be required to pay damages, including damages of up to three times the damages found or assessed, if the infringement is found to be willful, suspend the manufacture of certain products or reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible, or we may be unable to enter certain new product markets. Any such claims could also be expensive and time-consuming to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. Our competitive position could suffer as a result. In addition, if we have declined or failed to enter into a valid non-disclosure or assignment agreement for any reason, we may not own the invention or our intellectual property, and our products may not be adequately protected. Thus, we cannot guarantee that any of our future product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where it does not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our current and former employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, vendors and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets. Any party with whom we or they have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they disclose such trade secrets, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe may not obtain the requisite votes at our special meeting to ratify our reverse stock split.\nOn January 21, 2021, we received a stockholder litigation demand letter from the law firm of Purcell Julie & Lefkowitz LLP, on behalf of James Self, a purported stockholder of our Company. The letter demands that we (i) deem ineffective the December 30, 2020 amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation in which we effected a one-for-four reverse stock split of our common stock (the \u201c2020 Reverse Stock Split\u201d) due to the manner in which non-votes by brokers were tabulated, (ii) seek appropriate relief for damages allegedly suffered by the company and its stockholders or seek a valid stockholder approval of the amendment and reverse stock split, and (iii) adopt adequate internal controls to prevent a recurrence of the alleged misconduct. We dispute that the amendment was ineffective or that there were any inadequate internal controls related to the same. However, to eliminate any questions about the amendment, we intend to seek to ratify the amendment at a special stockholders\u2019 meeting pursuant to Section 204 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This special stockholders\u2019 meeting is scheduled to occur on May 14, 2021.\nOn March 19, 2021, in response to the stockholder demand letter, we filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A, which provided notice of a special meeting of stockholders and sought the ratification of the filing and effectiveness of the certificate of amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on December 30, 2020 to effect the 2020 Reverse Stock Split. Should we fail to obtain the requisite votes to ratify the 2020 Reverse Stock Split, the 2020 Reverse Stock Split will deemed to be invalid, and we will not have a requisite amount of authorized shares of common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility, and our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at a profit and incur losses.\nThe market price our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation. Market prices for securities of life sciences and biopharma companies in particular have historically been particularly volatile and have shown extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes, may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf investors react negatively to the effect on our business and prospects;\n\u25cf the announcement of new products, new developments, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin or earnings, and changes in our business, operations or prospects;\n\u25cf announcements relating to strategic relationships, mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, capital commitments, or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the life sciences and biopharma industries;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other life sciences and biopharma companies;\n\u25cf general market conditions or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance or financial condition;\n\u25cf sale of our common stock by stockholders, including executives and directors;\n\u25cf volatility and limitations in trading volumes of our common stock;\n\u25cf volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of companies in the life sciences and biopharma industries;\n\u25cf our ability to finance our business;\n\u25cf ability to secure resources and the necessary personnel to pursue our plans;\n\u25cf failures to meet external expectations or management guidance;\n\u25cf changes in our capital structure or dividend policy, future issuances of securities, sales or distributions of large blocks of common stock by stockholders;\n\u25cf our cash position;\n\u25cf announcements and events surrounding financing efforts, including debt and equity securities;\n\u25cf analyst research reports, recommendation and changes in recommendations, price targets, and withdrawals of coverage;\n\u25cf departures and additions of key personnel;\n\u25cf disputes and litigation related to intellectual properties, proprietary rights, and contractual obligations;\n\u25cf investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, or accounting practices and other dynamics; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, many of which may be out of our control.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of particular companies\u2019 securities, securities class action litigations have often been instituted against these companies. Litigation of this type, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require that we make significant payments.\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant financial market volatility and uncertainty in recent months. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional equity securities in the future, which may result in dilution to existing investors.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may, from time to time, sell additional equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine. If we sell additional equity securities, existing stockholders may be materially diluted. New investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders, such as liquidation and other preferences. In addition, the number of shares available for future grant under our equity compensation plans may be increased in the future. Also, the exercise or conversion of outstanding options or warrants to purchase shares of capital stock may result in dilution to our stockholders upon any such exercise or conversion.\nCertain stockholders could attempt to influence changes within our Company which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur stockholders may from time to time seek to acquire a controlling stake in our Company, engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly-traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming and could disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the operation of our business. These actions could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative evaluations, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the availability of research and reports that third-party industry or financial analysts publish about our Company. There are many large, publicly traded companies active in the life sciences and biopharma industries, which may mean it will be less likely that we receive widespread analyst coverage. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our Company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges in connection with the Offer that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough Ameri and Jay Pharma conducted due diligence on each other prior to the completion of the Offer, there can be no assurances that their diligence revealed all material issues that may be present in the other company\u2019s business, that all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence will be uncovered, or that factors outside of our control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise, and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with each company\u2019s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may make future financing difficult to obtain on favorable terms or at all.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware corporate law may make it difficult for our stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors and could deter or delay third parties from acquiring our Company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nUnder our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), including Section 203 of the DGCL. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d we may not enter into a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that person for three (3) years without special approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control. For purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL, \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d means, generally, someone owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned fifteen percent (15%) or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three (3) years, subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 203 of the DGCL.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that we will retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nIn the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted, which could affect our market price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is listed on NASDAQ. For continued listing on NASDAQ, we will be required to comply with the continued listing requirements, including the minimum market capitalization standard, the corporate governance requirements and the minimum closing bid price requirement, among other requirements. In the event that we fail to satisfy any of the listing requirements of NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted. If we are unable to list on NASDAQ, we would likely be more difficult to trade in or obtain accurate quotations as to the market price of our common stock. If our common stock is delisted from trading on NASDAQ, and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange or to have it quoted on NASDAQ, our securities could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3 or obtain additional financing in the future).\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nThe listing of our common stock on NASDAQ does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market exists. If an active market for our common stock does not develop, it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all.\nWe may acquire businesses or products, or form strategic alliances, in the future, and may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances, or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing, and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. There is no assurance that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the synergies expected in order to justify the transaction, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.", "PERMNO": 82215, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AMRH"}
