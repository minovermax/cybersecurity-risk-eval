Risk Factors\nOur business and operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, certain risks and uncertainties. An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nEconomic Risk\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position and operations have been and are expected to continue to be significant.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the outbreak has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced certain sectors of economic activity. Efforts to contain the pandemic, including vaccinations, have made progress in reducing the impact of COVID-19 and some restrictions that were put in place to reduce the spread of the virus have relaxed. However, as new variants of the virus cause additional outbreaks, their impact cannot be predicted at this time and could depend on numerous factors, including the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the variants, the availability of effective vaccines in different parts of the world, vaccination rates among the population and the response by governmental bodies to the pandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the continuing spread and rise of new variants, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the rollout and effectiveness of vaccination programs and the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, there may continue to be seasonal resurgences and we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s global economic impact.\nIn order to protect the health of our customers and employees, and to comply with applicable government directives, we have modified our business practices, including periodically allowing our employees to work remotely from their homes and cancelling certain in-person meetings. We may take further such actions that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers and communities or as may be required by government order. These actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar actions by our vendors and business partners, have not materially impaired our ability to support our employees, conduct our business and serve our customers, but there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to successfully mitigate the risks presented by COVID-19 or that our ability to operate will not be materially affected going forward. For instance, our business operations may be disrupted if key personnel or significant portions of our employees are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, if any of our vendors or business partners become unable to continue to provide their products and services, which we rely upon to maintain our day-to-day operations, our ability to serve our customers could be impacted.\nOur business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the general geographical markets in which we operate.\nOur operations are heavily concentrated in the Greene, Christian, Jasper and Newton Counties, which are in the southwestern corner of Missouri, including the cities of Springfield, Nixa, Ozark, Joplin, Carthage and Neosho, Missouri (our \u201cMarket Area\u201d). Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Although our customers' business and financial interests may extend well beyond our Market Area, adverse economic conditions that affect our Market Area could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us, affect the value of collateral underlying loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our relatively high concentration of real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values.\nReal estate lending comprises a significant portion of our lending business. Real estate loans including mortgage loans held for sale were $688.6 million, or approximately 83% of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2021. The market value of real estate securing our real estate loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in our Market Area which is where most of the real estate on which our real estate loans are made is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in our Market Area could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of our control or that of our borrowers could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties impairing the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans which could materially and adversely affect the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations depending on the severity of the economic downturn or the nature of the regulatory changes.\nDeterioration in asset quality could have an adverse impact on our business.\nA significant source of risk for us arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of diverse real and personal property that may be affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, environmental contamination (as discussed in more detail below) and other external events. In addition, decreases in real estate values due to the nature of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio (discussed above) could affect the ability of customers to repay their loans. The Bank\u2019s loan policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services throughout our market area. Our competitors include other community banks, regional and super-regional banking institutions, national banking institutions, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies, and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and some are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are. Many of our competitors compete across geographic boundaries and are able to provide customers with a feasible alternative to traditional banking services.\nAs we try to meet our competitors\u2019 terms and pricing, increased competition in our markets may result in:\n\u25cf\ninterest rate changes to various types of accounts;\n\u25cf\na decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits;\n\u25cf\nreduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates; or\n\u25cf\nloan terms that are more favorable to the borrower and less favorable to the Bank.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect our business.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions, including the Bank, are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of the difficulties or failures of other banks, which would increase the capital we need to support our growth. There can be no assurance that we could raise the necessary capital to support our growth on terms satisfactory to us or at all.\nQCR Holdings Merger Risk\nThe consummation of the proposed merger with QCR Holdings is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including shareholder and regulatory approvals, that may be outside of the Company\u2019s or QCR\u2019s control and that the Company and QCR may be unable to satisfy or obtain or which may delay the consummation of the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that could reduce the anticipated benefits from the merger or cause the parties to abandon the merger.\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to the proposed merger with QCR Holdings that was announced on November 9, 2021, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe market price of QCR common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of the Company or QCR currently;\n\u25cf\nthe termination of the merger agreement could result in negative impacts on the Company\u2019s stock price or negative reactions from the Company\u2019s customers and employees,\n\u25cf\nif the proposed merger is not consummated, the Company will have incurred substantial expenses relating the merger;\n\u25cf\nthe proposed merger has required and will require substantial time and resource commitments by the Company\u2019s management, which otherwise would have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to the Company as an independent company; and\n\u25cf\nwhile the merger is pending, the Company is subject to certain restrictions and uncertainties that may prevent it from pursuing other business opportunities;\n\u25cf\nthe proposed merger is subject a number of conditions, including approval by the Company\u2019s stockholders and other regulatory approvals.\nThe proposed merger may be delayed substantially or may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the agreement at any time, or the Company or QCR may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances. Any delay or termination of the proposed merger could mean that the Company fails to realize the anticipated benefits in a timely manner or at all.\nCredit and Interest Rate Risk\nEffects of COVID-19 substantially increases our credit risk.\nOur risks of non-timely loan repayment and deterioration in the value of collateral supporting the loans are affected by the strength of our borrower\u2019s businesses. Concern about the spread of COVID-19 has caused and is likely to continue to cause business shutdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, labor disruptions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment and commercial property vacancy rates, reduced profitability, and overall economic and financial market instability, all of which may cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan and mortgage payments. If the effects of COVID-19 result in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our portfolio, we could incur significant delinquencies, foreclosures and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure. The future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and other services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in us taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure, in the event of delinquencies. In addition, we have unfunded commitments to extend credit to customers. During a challenging economic environment like this, our customers are more dependent on our credit commitments and increased borrowings under these commitments could adversely impact our liquidity. Furthermore, in an effort to support our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are participating in the PPP under the CARES Act whereby loans to small businesses are made and those loans are subject to the regulatory requirements that would require forbearance of loan payments for a specified time or that would limit our ability to pursue all available remedies in the event of a loan default. If the borrower under the PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, we are at heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to the loans to customers to which we would have otherwise extended credit. Detailed information regarding PPP loans and loan modifications are included below in the General section of Part II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nEffects of COVID-19 may materially adversely increase interest rate risk.\nOur net interest income, lending activities, deposits and profitability could be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 150 basis points to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent, citing concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on overall markets. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition. Because there have been no comparable recent global pandemics that resulted in similar global impacts, we do not yet know the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s effects on our business, operations, or the global economy as a whole. Any future development will be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements, third party providers\u2019 abilities to support our operations, and any actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The uncertain future development of this crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, operating results, financial condition, liquidity or capital levels.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to the percentage of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes a significant amount of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to owner-occupied residential real estate loans or consumer loans because commercial loans often have larger balances, and repayment usually depends on the borrowers\u2019 successful business operations. The underlying commercial real estate values, customer cash flow and payment expectations on such loans can be more easily influenced by adverse conditions in the related industries, the real estate market or in the economy in general. Any significant deterioration in the credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio or underlying collateral values would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nManagement\u2019s analysis of the necessary funding for the allowance for loan loss account may be incorrect or may suddenly change resulting in lower earnings.\nThe funding of the allowance for loan loss account is the most significant estimate made by management in its financial reporting to stockholders and regulators. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes.\nAlthough management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 was adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible, we cannot predict loan losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that our allowance for loan losses will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions are more difficult than management currently expects. If negative changes to the performance of our loan portfolio were to occur, management may find it necessary to or be required to fund the allowance for loan loss account through additional charges to our provision for loan loss expense. These changes may occur suddenly and be dramatic in nature. Additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses and loan losses in excess of said allowance may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA new accounting standard will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FASB has adopted a new accounting standard that is scheduled to be effective for us on January 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we will need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRapidly changing interest rate environments could reduce our net interest margin and otherwise negatively impact our results of operations.\nInterest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are a large part of our net income. Interest rates are the key drivers of our net interest margin and are subject to many factors beyond the control of management. As interest rates change, our net interest income is affected. Rapid increases in interest rates in the future could result in our interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in the maturities of our assets and liabilities. Furthermore, substantially higher rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth for us. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between our interest rates earned on assets and our rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease our net interest income, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rate changes may affect borrowers\u2019 repayment schedules, negatively impacting our financial condition.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of underlying collateral may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on certain of our loans as borrowers refinance at lower rates. Fluctuation in interest rates may therefore change borrowers\u2019 timing of repayment of, or ability to repay loans, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our nonperforming assets, decreasing net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in our nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets resulting from changes in interest rates would have an adverse impact on net interest income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect our revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is a short-term interest rate used as a pricing reference for certain loans, derivatives and other financial instruments. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC issued a joint statement confirming that the lesser used one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings would cease publication at the end of 2021, but the remaining USD LIBOR settings would continue publication until June 30, 2023 to better facilitate an orderly transition. These announcements, in conjunction with other financial benchmark reforms and changes in the interbank lending markets, have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and certain other rates or indices that are used as interest rate \u201cbenchmarks.\u201d In addition, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the market for floating-rate financial instruments.\nUncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including the value of, return on and trading market for our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to benchmarks, including any LIBOR-based securities, loans and derivatives. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for an actual discontinuation of benchmarks, including LIBOR, that may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics (including, but not limited to, interest rates to be paid to or by us), which may also result in adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations. Such transition may also result in litigation with counterparties impacted by the transition as well as increased regulatory scrutiny and other adverse consequences. In addition, any replacement benchmark ultimately adopted as a substitute for LIBOR, including SOFR, may behave differently than LIBOR in a manner detrimental to our financial performance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had derivative financial instruments, a line of credit with another financial institution, certain investment securities and segments of commercial and consumer loans indexed to LIBOR. Management continues to monitor developments with the transition to a new benchmark and will adopt fallback language on existing contracts as well as select an alternative benchmark during 2022. As there are still uncertainties in adopting a new index rate, the overall impact of this change on our financial results is unknown at this time.\nOperational Risk\nThe effects of COVID-19 may continue to adversely affect the operations of the Bank.\nRestrictions on our workforce\u2019s access to our facilities could limit our ability to meet customer servicing expectations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. We rely on business processes and branch activity that largely depend on people and technology, including access to information technology systems as well as information, applications, payment systems and other services provided by third parties. In response to COVID-19, we have modified our business practices periodically allowing our employees to work remotely from their homes to have our operations uninterrupted as much as possible. Further, technology in employees\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. The continuation of these remote work measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cybersecurity risks include increased phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nMoreover, we rely on many third parties in our business operations, including appraisers of the real property collateral securing our loans, vendors that supply essential services such as loan servicers, providers of financial information, systems and analytical tools and providers of electronic payment and settlement systems, and local and federal government agencies, offices, and courthouses. In light of the developing measures responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these entities may limit the availability and access of their services. For example, loan originations could be delayed due to the limited availability of real estate appraisers for the collateral. Loan closings could be delayed related to reductions in available staff in recording offices or the closing of courthouses in certain counties, which slows the process for title work, mortgage and UCC filings in those counties. If the third-party service providers continue to have limited capacities for a prolonged period or if additional limitations or potential disruptions in these services materialize, it may negatively affect our operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with real estate collateral securing our loans.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. Under certain circumstances, we may take title to the real property collateral through foreclosure or other means. As the titleholder of the property, we may be responsible for environmental risks, such as hazardous materials, which attach to the property. For these reasons, prior to extending credit, we conduct an environmental review to identify any known environmental risks associated with the real property that will secure our loans. In addition, we routinely inspect properties prior to foreclosing. If environmental risks are found, environmental laws and regulations may prescribe our approach to remediation. As a result, while we have ownership of a property, we may incur substantial expense and bear potential liability for any damages caused. The environmental risks may also materially reduce the property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the property. We also cannot guarantee that our environmental review will detect all environmental issues relating to a property, which could subject us to additional liability.\nOur operations are concentrated in one subsidiary bank. An event or a series of events having a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and, accordingly, on your investment in us.\nAs a holding company with only one subsidiary bank, our investment risk is concentrated in just one primary operating asset in a relatively small geographic location. A substantial portion of our cash flow comes from dividends paid directly to us by the Bank. If and to the extent the Bank is not successful or an event were to occur that prevents it or hinders it from operating effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Larger bank holding companies with more subsidiary banks or bank facilities and which are more geographically dispersed are not as susceptible to the concentrated risks we are if one of their subsidiary banks or facilities was not able to operate effectively.\nA failure in or breach of our information security controls, or those of our third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, adversely impact our financial condition and cause reputational harm.\nInformation pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third-party vendors, such as our online banking, mobile banking and accounting systems. Our operations are heavily dependent on the secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as the execution of transactions over these networks and systems.\nAs a bank, we are susceptible to electronic fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our customers. In addition, our customers may use personal mobile or computing devices to access our products or services that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. If one or more of these events occurs, it may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, inadvertent and unintentional disclosure or misuse of our information or our customer information, misappropriation of assets, litigation or damage to our reputation. In addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.\nThe risk of such incidents within the financial services industry has increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of attackers, such as hackers. In recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity.\nFraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our customers, denial or degradation of service attacks and malware or other cyber-attacks. Breaches of information security also may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our customers\u2019 confidential information, including our employees and our third-party vendors.\nAlthough we have implemented security measures that are designed to prevent security breaches and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective, especially as cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Failure to mitigate breaches of security could result in violations of applicable privacy laws, regulatory fines, litigation exposure, and increased security compliance costs, all of which could damage our reputation and result in the loss of customers and business. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe depend upon third-party vendors for a significant portion of our operations.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for a substantial portion of our operations, including communication, record retention, and financial control systems technology. While we endeavor to select reliable and competent vendors, we cannot control our vendors or their actions. The potential for operational risk exposure exists because of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties in our daily and ongoing operations. Any problems caused by or suffered by a third-party vendor, including a vendor\u2019s failure to provide contracted services, poor performance by a vendor, disruption of a vendor\u2019s business operations, or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our ability to serve our customers or to conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing a vendor could entail significant delay and expense.\nOur third-party vendors are also subject to the cybersecurity risks discussed above. A cyberattack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of a third-party vendor could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we review the security practices of third-party vendors before contracting with them, we cannot control their systems or security. If our data or the data of our customers is improperly accessed, used, transmitted, or otherwise obtained because of, or due in part to, actions or inactions caused by our third-party vendors, we could face significant operational harm, legal and financial exposure, and reputational damage.\u201d\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we cannot predict how changes in technology will affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect our financial results.\nTechnology and other changes now allow many customers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely impact our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes.\nThe financial condition of the Bank\u2019s customers and borrowers could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and its results of operations.\nTwo of the Bank\u2019s primary sources of funds are customer deposits and loan repayments. Customer deposit levels may also be affected by a number of factors, including the competitive interest rate environment in both the national market and our Market Area, local and national economic conditions, natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides, wildfires, extreme weather conditions, hurricanes, floods, and other acts of nature, geopolitical events such as those involving civil unrest, changes in the government regimes, terrorism or military conflict, and pandemics and other public health crises, and other catastrophic events.\nThough scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of liquidity, they are subject to the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans. The ability of the borrowers to repay their loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to those noted above, including concerns about the occurrence of such events.\nThe foregoing events or concerns about the occurrence of any such events, could impair our borrowers\u2019 ability to service their loans, decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers, erode the value of loan collateral, result in an increase in the amount of our non-performing loans and a higher level of non-performing assets (including real estate owned), net charge-offs, and provision for loan losses, lead to other operational difficulties and impair our ability to manage our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our common stock. We also could be adversely affected if our key personnel or a significant number of our employees were to become unavailable due to a public health crisis or an outbreak of a contagious disease (such as the current COVID-19 pandemic), natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or other reason. Natural disasters, geopolitical events, public health crises (again, such as COVID-19) and other catastrophic events could also negatively affect our customers, counterparties and service providers, as well as result in disruptions in general economic activity and the financial and real estate markets.\nThere continue to be broad and continuing concerns related to the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. If COVID-19 has an adverse effect on (i) customer deposits, (ii) the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations to us, (iii) the demand for our loans or our other products and services, (iv) other aspects of our business operations, or (v) on financial markets or economic growth, this could, depending on the extent of the decline in customer deposits or loan defaults, materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdequate liquidity is critical in our ability to meet the needs of our customers. An inability to access funding through customer deposits, available borrowings, sales of loans or investments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. Furthermore, regional and community banks, including the Bank, generally have less access to the capital markets, than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size and limited analyst coverage. Any significant decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability in the future to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our stockholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA decrease in cash flows from our investment portfolio may adversely affect our liquidity.\nAnother primary source of liquidity for the Bank is cash flows from investment securities. Cash flows from the investment portfolio may be affected by changes in interest rates, resulting in excessive levels of cash flow during periods of declining interest rates and lower levels of cash flow during periods of rising interest rates. These changes may be beyond our control and could significantly influence our available cash.\nIf we are required to rely on secondary sources of liquidity, those sources may not be immediately available.\nWe may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include the FHLB advances, brokered deposits and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative publicity about the financial services industry as a whole. We may also be required to pledge investments as collateral to borrow money from third parties. In certain cases, we may be required to sell investment instruments for sizable losses to meet liquidity needs, thereby reducing interest income and resultantly net income. While we believe that we are currently sufficiently liquid, there can be no assurance we will not in the future be required to turn to these secondary sources of liquidity which may not be available or only at costs that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nInability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management and staff could adversely affect our revenues, net income and growth plans.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals and their ability to attract and retain customer relationships in a community bank environment. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as our loan and deposit portfolios. Certain key management team members and loan officers are not subject to employment contracts with us. Such employees are at-will and thus are not restricted from terminating their employment. The lack of employment contracts with key employees could have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain such employees. The loss of key management or our key loan officers with their contacts in the business communities within our Market Area may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues.\nIf we do struggle with employee retention, our success may also be impacted if we are unable to recruit replacement management and key employees in a reasonable amount of time. There is intense competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting, hiring, and training expenses, resulting in lower net income.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses, regulatory sanctions, lawsuits and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers, or improper use of confidential information. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks. However, if our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory and Compliance Risk\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that may significantly affect our operations or earnings.\nWe are subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision, as discussed in more detail below, which is primarily for the benefit and protection of the Bank\u2019s customers and not for the benefit of investors. As a result, various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our Bank subsidiary can pay to us without regulatory approval. Our regulatory compliance is costly. We are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various agencies, including the FRB, the MDF and FDIC. These regulators have broad discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, as discussed under \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of this report, which require that we and the Bank maintain adequate capital to support our growth and the Bank\u2019s growth. To the extent our activities and/or the Bank\u2019s activities are restricted or limited by regulation or regulators\u2019 supervisory authority, our future profitability may be adversely affected.\nAn uncertain regulatory environment could impact our business, financial performance, and results of operations.\nMany aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to continued rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. The U.S. Congress continues to propose new legislation that could increase or change regulation of the financial services industry and impact the operations of the Bank or Company.\nOn February 3, 2017, Executive Order 13772 announcing new \u201cCore Principles\u201d for regulating the U.S. financial system was enacted. Among other things, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with federal regulatory agencies, was directed to review existing laws and regulations and report on the extent to which they were consistent with the Core Principles. Indications were also made in public statements that the Dodd-Frank Act will be under scrutiny and that some of its provisions and the rules promulgated thereunder may be revised, repealed or amended. It is not clear when, or if, changes to existing statutory or regulatory requirements may be implemented.\nThe implementation, amendment, or repeal of federal financial services laws or regulations may impact our profitability, limit our business opportunities, impose additional costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any changes may also require us to invest management attention and resources to achieve compliance. In addition, any proposed legislative or regulatory changes that could benefit our business may not occur in the timeframe proposed, may appear different in final form than proposed, or may not occur at all.\nChanges in federal or state regulation may increase our costs.\nThe laws, regulations, policies, and interpretations that govern our industry are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. The Dodd-Frank Act reshaped regulation of banking institutions and the numerous requirements stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act have resulted in increased compliance costs for institutions both large and small, including us and the Bank. As these regulations continue to be implemented, interpreted, and enforced, our compliance must evolve as well. The CFPB has shown that it is a proactive agency and we anticipate that the CFPB will continue to expand its supervisory and enforcement authority into new areas and to issue new rules and guidance.\nWe cannot predict the nature or effect of current or proposed legislative or regulatory changes on us or the Bank with any certainty. Changes in laws or regulations could impact our business practices and profitability. We also cannot predict the cost of new compliance that may be required to keep pace with industry regulatory changes.\nDecreases in capital and changes to the formulas for calculating adequate capital may negatively impact us or result in increased regulatory supervision.\nFederal rules require banking institutions to maintain an adequate level of regulatory capital (net assets available to absorb losses). Due to the risks associated with the industry, banking institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses. Revised minimum capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Rule became effective for us and the Bank on January 1, 2015, with additional requirements, such as the capital conservation buffer (discussed below). These requirements change the definition of capital, increase minimum required risk-based capital ratios, and increase the risk-weights for certain assets. Cumulatively, the Basel III Rule is more stringent than prior requirements and requires financial institutions to hold more and better capital against their assets, decreasing the size of their balance sheets. Although the impact on us has been minimal to date, we cannot guarantee that will continue.\nFinancial institutions that adopted the CBLR framework must maintain capital conservation buffers above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer must be maintained to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. If we or the Bank fall below thresholds, we could be subject to increasingly strict limitations on capital distributions and bonus payments. Additional details are listed below.\nFederal law provides regulators with broad powers to take \"prompt corrective action\" to resolve capital deficiencies at insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. There are five capital tiers: \"well capitalized,\" \"adequately capitalized,\" \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" and \"critically undercapitalized.\" As an institution\u2019s capital levels deteriorates and it falls below the \u201cwell capitalized\u201d threshold, such institution faces increasing penalties. Regulator\u2019s corrective powers include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nrequiring a waiver to accept brokered deposits;\n\u25cf\nrequiring submission of a capital plan;\n\u25cf\nlimiting growth or restricting activities;\n\u25cf\nrequiring the issuance of additional capital stock;\n\u25cf\nrestricting transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting executive bonuses or raises;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting the payment of subordinated debt; and\n\u25cf\nappointing a receiver.\nA final rule issued on September 17, 2019 by federal banking regulators provides a simpler method of measuring adequate capital ratios for community banking organizations. The community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework is an optional framework that is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. The framework provides a simple measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations, consistent with section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent are considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rule. These institutions also must have met well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The final rule went into effect on January 1, 2020. The Company opted into the new CBLR method during 2020. The decision to adopt this framework did not have a material impact on financial results of the Company.\nAccordingly, we and the Bank could be subject to regulatory penalties and restrictions if capital falls below certain minimum thresholds set by federal banking regulators.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, including economic conditions specifically in our Market Area, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe effects of the monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve upon our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future cannot be predicted, but have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including our Bank, in the past.\nChanges in the federal or state tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe are subject to tax law changes that could increase the effective tax rate payable to the state or federal government. These changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result, could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. Should future changes to tax regulations and rates occur, the Company\u2019s customers are likely to experience varying effects from changes in both the individual and business tax provisions. Such changes could include (i) limiting the deductibility of mortgage interest on single family residential mortgage loans, (ii) limitations on interest deductions for home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. Recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us.\nWe could in the future become subject to lawsuits or regulatory proceedings challenging the legality of our lending or business practices. Future actions against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us. As a participant in the financial services industry, we are exposed to a high level of potential litigation related to our businesses and operations. Although we maintain insurance, the scope of this coverage may not provide us with full, or even partial, coverage in any particular case.\nOur businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject us to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure our operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing our revenue.\nRisks Related to Investment in Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\nProvisions in our governing documents, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) and federal regulations could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders.\nThese provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\na prohibition on voting shares of common stock beneficially owned in excess of 10% of total shares outstanding without prior Board approval;\n\u25cf\nsupermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations with any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of our outstanding common stock;\n\u25cf\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf\nthe election of directors to staggered terms of three years;\n\u25cf\na requirement that only directors may fill a vacancy in our Board of Directors; and\n\u25cf\nsupermajority voting requirements to remove any of our directors.\nIn addition, because we are a bank holding company, purchasers of 10% or more of our common stock may be required to obtain approvals under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u201cBHCA\u201d), and in certain cases such approvals may be required at a lesser percentage of ownership.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.\nThere are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by Delaware law, as well as regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligation to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to the Bank. If current or any future regulatory requirements are not met, the Bank will not be able to pay dividends to us, and we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe DGCL provides that dividends by a Delaware corporation may be paid only from: (1) \u201csurplus\u201d determined in the manner described in the DGCL, or (2) in case there is no \u201csurplus,\u201d net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Dividends paid from the second source may not be paid unless the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets at current market value is intact.\nMoreover, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Federal Reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments (i.e., perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt) in light of our earnings, capital adequacy and financial condition. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve indicates that the Board of Directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the dividends if:\n\u25cf\nthe company\u2019s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n\u25cf\nthe prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or\n\u25cf\nthe company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nIn the future, if we default on certain of our outstanding debts, we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current.\nFailure to pay interest on our debt may adversely impact our ability to pay common stock dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $10.3 million of subordinated debentures held by a Capital Trust. Interest payments on the Company\u2019s existing debenture, which totaled $569,000 for 2021, must be paid before the Company can pay dividends on its capital stock, including its common stock. The Company has the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if it elects to defer interest payments, all deferred interest must be paid before the Company can pay dividends on its capital stock.\nAlthough the Company expects to be able to pay all required interest on the junior subordinated debenture, there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, it has a low average daily trading volume relative to many other stocks whose shares are also quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. We cannot assure you that the volume of trading in our common stock will increase in the future.\nAdditionally, general market forces may have a negative effect on our stock price, independent of factors affecting our stock specifically. Factors beyond our control, including price and trading fluctuation, can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These conditions may result in (i) volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and (ii) sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nSpecifically, the following factors may cause the market price of our shares to fluctuate:\n\u25cf\nannouncements of developments related to our business model;\n\u25cf\neconomic conditions in our market area;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in our results from operations;\n\u25cf\na shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to analyst\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections; and\n\u25cf\nannouncements of new acquisitions or projects.\nOther\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to us from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, unethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and general reporting practices within the U.S. financial services industry, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies, such as those pertaining to our allowance for loan losses, require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results vary significantly, there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods.", "PERMNO": 81560, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "GFED"}
