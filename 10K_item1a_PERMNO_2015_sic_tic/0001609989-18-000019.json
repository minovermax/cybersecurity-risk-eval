{"cik": "1609989", "company": "Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our Company and our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impact our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Pending Merger\nThe pending Merger with GMI is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may require significant time and attention of our management, and may have a material adverse effect on us if it is not completed.\nOn February 22, 2018, the Registrant entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, GMI will purchase our common stock for cash consideration. The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed Merger and restricts us, without GMI\u2019s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration of our business with GMI may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe currently anticipate that we will close the Merger during the second quarter of 2018, but we cannot be certain when or if the conditions for the Merger will be satisfied or waived. The Merger cannot be completed until the conditions are satisfied or waived, including the receipt of required antitrust and other regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Satisfying the conditions to the closing of the Merger may take longer than we expect. In the event that the Merger is not completed for any reason, the holders of our common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed Merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company and holders of our common stock will continue to own their shares of our common stock. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price may reflect an assumption that the Merger will be consummated at the per share merger consideration of $40.00 in cash specified in the Merger Agreement. Investor confidence also could decline.\nWhether or not we complete the Merger, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences as a result of pursuing the Merger, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nexecution of the proposed Merger will require significant time and attention from management, which may distract them from the operation of our business and the execution of other initiatives that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nour employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with the Company pending the completion of the Merger;\n\u2022\nparties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or alter their present business relationships with us;\n\u2022\nwe could be subject to litigation related to the proposed Merger, which could result in significant costs and expenses;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay significant costs and expenses relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees, whether or not the Merger is completed;\n\u2022\nwe may have to forgo other opportunities in favor of the Merger instead of pursuing such other opportunities that could be beneficial to the Company; and\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, particularly if we fail to complete the Merger.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the amount of the per share merger consideration to be paid in cash pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fixed and will not be increased for changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition or results of operation or in the event of any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy on a timely basis or at all.\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our growth strategy of expanding distribution and improving placement of our products in the stores of our retail partners, attracting new consumers to our brand, and introducing new products and product line extensions and expanding into new markets. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to:\n\u2022\nenter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with retailers and other potential distributors of our products;\n\u2022\neffectively compete in specialty and FDM channels;\n\u2022\nsecure shelf space in the stores and websites of our retail partners;\n\u2022\nincrease our brand recognition by effectively implementing our marketing strategy and advertising initiatives;\n\u2022\nexpand and maintain brand loyalty;\n\u2022\ndevelop new products and product line extensions that appeal to consumers;\n\u2022\nmaintain and, to the extent necessary, improve our high standards for product quality, safety and integrity;\n\u2022\nmaintain sources for the required supply of quality raw ingredients to meet our growing demand;\n\u2022\ncontinue successfully to expand our internal manufacturing capabilities, including completing construction of our new dry food manufacturing facility and ramping up production of that facility;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully operate our Heartland Facilities;\n\u2022\nfurther expand in both new and existing international markets;\n\u2022\nidentify and successfully enter, and market our products in, new geographic markets and market segments; and\n\u2022\ncontinue to educate the veterinarian community about our line of veterinary exclusive therapeutic products and generate recommendations from veterinarians for our current portfolio of Wholesome Natural products.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy and may need to change our strategy. If we fail to implement our growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe growth of our business depends on our ability to predict accurately consumer trends and demand and successfully introduce new products and product line extensions, improve existing products and offer our products at attractive price points.\nOur growth depends, in part, on our ability successfully to introduce new products and product line extensions and improve and reposition our existing products to meet the requirements of pet parents and the dietary needs of their pets. This, in turn, depends on our ability to predict and respond to evolving consumer trends, demands and preferences. The development and introduction of innovative new products and product line extensions involve considerable costs. In addition, it may be difficult to establish new supplier relationships and determine appropriate product selection when developing a new product or product line extension. Any new product or product line extension may not generate sufficient customer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion and may reduce our operating income. In addition, any such unsuccessful effort may adversely affect our brand. If we are not able to anticipate, identify or develop and market products that respond to changes in requirements and preferences of pet parents and their pets or if our new product introductions or repositioned products fail to gain consumer acceptance, we may not grow our business as anticipated, our sales may decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. If our retail prices were to increase due to a price increase by us or by price increases or lower promotions by our retailer partners, the consumer demand for our products and hence our sales may decline.\nAny damage to our reputation or our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMaintaining our strong reputation with consumers, our retail partners and our suppliers is critical to our success. Our brand may suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives are not successful. The importance of our brand may increase if competitors offer more products with formulations similar to ours. Price competition between retailers may drive our retail prices down and may adversely impact our brand equity and reputation among consumers and/or retailers. Further, our brand may be negatively impacted due to real or perceived quality issues or if consumers perceive us as being untruthful in our marketing and advertising, even if such perceptions are not accurate. Product contamination, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations of product quality issues, mislabeling or contamination, even if untrue or caused by our third-party contract manufacturers or raw material suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We maintain guidelines and procedures to ensure the quality, safety and integrity of our products. However, we may be unable to detect or prevent product and/or ingredient quality issues, mislabeling or contamination, particularly in instances of fraud or attempts to cover up or obscure deviations from our guidelines and procedures. If any of our products become unfit for consumption, cause injury or are mislabeled, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability. Damage to our reputation or our brand or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur growth and business are dependent on trends that may change or not continue, and our historical growth may not be indicative of our future growth.\nThe growth of the overall pet food industry depends primarily on the continuance of current trends in humanization of pets and premiumization of pet foods as well as on general economic conditions, the size of the pet population and average dog size. The growth of the Wholesome Natural market segment and our business, in particular, depends on the continuance of such humanization and premiumization trends and health and wellness trends. We also benefit from growth rates in the channels in which we participate, such as pet superstores, food and mass stores, farm and feed stores and eCommerce. These trends may not continue or may change. For example, pet superstores have recently experienced reduced foot traffic and reduced sales. We believe that these trends may continue, which would result in a decline in our growth rate unless offset by growth in other channels and accounts. In addition, in the event of a decline in the overall number or average size of pets, a change in the humanization, premiumization or health and wellness trends or during challenging economic times, we may be unable to persuade our customers and consumers to purchase our branded products instead of lower-priced products, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and our growth rate may slow or stop. In addition, while we expect that our net sales will continue to increase, we believe that our growth rate will decline in the future as our scale increases.\nThere may be decreased spending on pets in a challenging economic climate.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, and may in the future experience, challenging economic conditions. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nmaterially adversely affected by a challenging economic climate, including adverse changes in interest rates, volatile commodity markets and inflation, contraction in the availability of credit in the market and reductions in consumer spending. In addition, a slow-down in the general economy or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional, local or Private Label products or other less expensive products may result in reduced demand for our products which may affect our profitability. The keeping of pets and the purchase of pet-related products may constitute discretionary spending for some of our consumers and any material decline in the amount of consumer discretionary spending may reduce overall levels of pet ownership or spending on pets. As a result, a challenging economic climate may cause a decline in demand for our products which could be disproportionate as compared to competing pet food brands since our products command a price premium. In addition, we cannot predict how current or worsening economic conditions will affect our retail partners, suppliers and distributors. If economic conditions result in decreased spending on pets and have a negative impact on our retail partners, suppliers or distributors, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends, in part, on the sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade promotion programs.\nDue to the highly competitive nature of our industry, we must effectively and efficiently promote and market our products through television, internet and print advertisements as well as trade promotions and incentives to sustain our competitive position in our market. Marketing investments may be costly. In addition, we may, from time to time, change our marketing strategies and spending, including the timing or nature of our trade promotions and incentives. We may also change our marketing strategies and spending in response to actions by our competitors and other pet food companies. The sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade promotions and incentives are important to our ability to retain and/or improve our market share and margins. If our marketing and trade promotions and incentives are not successful or if we fail to implement sufficient and effective marketing and trade promotions and incentives or adequately respond to changes in our competitors\u2019 marketing strategies, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase prices, our margins may decrease.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to persuade consumers to purchase our branded products, which generally command a price premium as compared to prices of Engineered and Private Label products. Some products in the Engineered market segment may be labeled as \u201cnatural\u201d in accordance with the AAFCO regulatory definition even though they do not satisfy all the requirements of the Wholesome Natural market segment. These products are often priced lower than ours and even if we do not increase prices, consumers may choose to purchase such products instead of ours, based on the fact that such products cost less but yet are still labeled as \u201cnatural.\u201d\nWe rely in part on price increases to offset cost increases and improve the profitability of our business. Our ability to maintain prices or effectively implement price increases may be affected by a number of factors, including competition, effectiveness of our marketing programs, the continuing strength of our brand, market demand and general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures. In particular, in response to increased promotional activity by other pet food companies, we have in the past increased, and may in the future increase, our promotional spending, which for the period of the\npromotion, results in a lower average price per pound for our products and adversely impacts our gross margins. In addition, evolving customer dynamics in the grocery and mass channels may require us to increase our promotional spending in these channels, which may adversely impact our gross margins.\nDuring challenging economic times, consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price premium for our branded products and may shift purchases to lower-priced or other value offerings, making it more difficult for us to maintain prices and/or effectively implement price increases. In addition, our retail partners and distributors may pressure us to rescind price increases that we have announced or already implemented, whether through a change in list price or increased promotional activity. If we are unable to maintain or increase prices for our products or must increase promotional activity, our margins may be adversely affected. Furthermore, price increases generally result in volume losses, as consumers purchase fewer units. If such losses are greater than expected or if we lose distribution due to a price increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf our products are alleged to cause injury or illness or fail to comply with governmental regulations, we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims.\nOur products may be exposed to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if they are alleged to cause or pose a risk of injury or illness or if they are alleged to have been mislabeled, misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise be in violation of governmental regulations. We may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we consider do not meet our standards, whether for palatability, appearance or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. For example, over the past three years, we issued five voluntary recalls, four of which were the result of errors occurring at third-party suppliers. These recalls resulted in a reduction to net sales and the incurrence of incremental expenses. If there is any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation or lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe also may be subject to product liability claims if the consumption or use of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness. While we carry product liability insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur in connection with product liability claims. For example, punitive damages are generally not covered by insurance. In addition, we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance, obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or secure additional coverage, which may result in future product liability claims being uninsured. If there is a product liability judgment against us or a settlement agreement related to a product liability claim, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a relatively limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales.\nWe sell our products to retail partners and distributors in specialty channels and recently commenced selling our products to grocery and mass retailers in the FDM channel. Our two largest retail partners, PetSmart (including Chewy.com as of an estimated acquisition date of June 1, 2017) and Petco, accounted for 41% and 18% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, 41% and 22% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 46% and 24% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we experienced significant\ngrowth in our net sales to eCommerce retailers and are becoming increasingly dependent on such retailers. If we were to lose any of our key customers, if any of our retail partners reduce the amount of their orders or if any of our key customers consolidate, reduce their store footprint and/or gain greater market power, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, national pet superstores have experienced reduced store traffic. If pet superstores continue to experience reduced store traffic, or experience any operational difficulties, we may be adversely affected. We may be similarly adversely impacted if any of our other key customers experience any operational difficulties or generate less traffic.\nIn addition, we do not enter into contracts with national pet superstores, eCommerce retailers, grocery and mass retailers, and certain other large retailers, that obligate them to buy, or us to sell, our products, and we do not have long-term contracts with our other customers. As a result, we rely on our consumers\u2019 continuing demand for our products and our position in the market for all purchase orders. We also rely on our retail partners carrying a broad selection of our products and working with us to execute in-store sales and marketing programs in order to differentiate our brands and drive consumer demand. If our retail partners or distributors are not satisfied with their margins on BLUE products due to changes in their expectations or due to changes to pricing strategies by us, our sales could decrease and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may be similarly negatively impacted if our retail partners change their pricing and margin expectations or business strategies as a result of our decision to expand distribution into grocery and mass retailers in the FDM channel, industry consolidation or otherwise, including a reduction or restriction of our in-store programs (both online and offline), a reduction in the number of brands they carry, a reduction or even elimination of the shelf space, or a change in the prominence of the shelf space they allocate to our products. They could even make a decision to stop selling our products altogether or increase emphasis on Private Label or other brands\u2019 products.\nWe rely upon a limited number of contract manufacturers to provide a significant portion of our supply of products.\nThere is limited available manufacturing capacity that meets our quality standards. Our current plans to meet expected production needs rely in large part on successful ongoing operations at our Joplin Dry Food Facility and our new Heartland Richmond Facility and Joplin Treats Facility. Our Joplin Dry Food Facility may not, however, continue to operate in accordance with our expectations, and we may experience delays in the ramping up of our Joplin Treats Facility and the completion of construction and ramping up of our Heartland Richmond Facility.\nWe have agreements with a network of contract manufacturers that require them to provide us with specific finished products. Most of our agreements with our contract manufacturers automatically renew for consecutive one-year terms until notice of non-renewal is given. Upon expiration of our existing agreements with these contract manufacturers, or if our contract manufacturers were to merge or get acquired, we may not be able to renegotiate the terms of our agreements with these contract manufacturers on a commercially reasonable basis or at all.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 approximately 43%, 41%, and 44%, respectively, of our cost of sales was derived from products purchased from the Company\u2019s five largest contract manufacturers. We manufacture our wet foods at two different locations owned by a single\ncontract manufacturer and certain of our treats are also manufactured by single-source contract manufacturers. The manufacture of our products may not be easily transferable to other sites in the event that any of our contract manufacturers experience breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies, labor problems, power outages, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters or the need to comply with environmental and other directives of governmental agencies. From time to time, a contract manufacturer may experience financial difficulties, bankruptcy or other business disruptions, which could disrupt our supply of finished goods or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the contract manufacturer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption, such as establishing a new contract manufacturing arrangement with another provider.\nThe loss of any of these contract manufacturers or the failure for any reason of any of these contract manufacturers to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with us, including a failure to meet our quality controls and standards, may result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods. We may be unable to locate an additional or alternate contract manufacturing arrangement that meets our quality controls and standards in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nTo the extent our customers purchase products in excess of consumer consumption in any period, our sales in a subsequent period may be adversely affected as our customers seek to reduce their inventory levels.\nFrom time to time, our customers may purchase more product than they expect to sell to consumers during a particular time period. Our customers may grow their inventory in anticipation of, or during, our promotional events, which typically provide for reduced prices during a specified time or other customer or consumer incentives. Our customers may also grow inventory in anticipation of a price increase for our products, or otherwise over-order our products as a result of overestimating demand for our products. If a customer increases its inventory during a particular reporting period as a result of a promotional event, anticipated price increase or otherwise, then sales during the subsequent reporting period may be adversely impacted as our customers seek to reduce their inventory levels. This effect may be particularly pronounced when the promotional event, price increase or other event occurs near the end or beginning of a reporting period or when there are changes in the timing of a promotional event, price increase or similar event, as compared to the prior year. To the extent our customers seek to reduce their usual or customary inventory levels or change their practices regarding purchases in excess of consumer consumption, our net sales and results of operations may be materially adversely affected in that period.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and may lose market share or experience margin erosion if we are unable to compete effectively.\nThe pet food industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of product quality and palatability, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety and ingredients, interesting product names, product packaging and package design, shelf space (both online and in-store), reputation, price and promotional efforts. We compete with a significant number of companies of varying sizes, including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies that may have greater financial resources and larger customer bases than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to identify and adapt to changes in consumer preferences more quickly than us due to their resources and scale. They may also be more\nsuccessful in marketing and selling their products, better able to increase prices to reflect cost pressures and better able to increase their promotional activity, which may impact us and the entire pet food industry. Increased promotional activity may include increasing the size of packaging, which in turn has in the past reduced and may in the future reduce foot traffic at retailers and the number of opportunities we have to educate pet parents about the benefits of BLUE. In addition, these larger companies have entered the Wholesome Natural market segment and we expect them to continue to launch new Wholesome Natural brands, acquire existing Wholesome Natural brands, launch brand extensions or increase the promotion of existing Wholesome Natural brands and pet food products, all of which will increase our direct competition. We also compete with other companies who focus solely on manufacturing Wholesome Natural pet foods that may be smaller, more innovative and/or able to bring products to market faster and move more quickly to exploit and serve niche markets. If these competitive pressures cause our products to lose market share or experience margin erosion, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may face issues with respect to increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies, contaminations, adulterations or mislabeling.\nWe and our contract manufacturers use various raw materials and other supplies in our business, including ingredients, packaging materials and fuel. The prices of our raw materials and other supplies are subject to fluctuations attributable to, among other things, changes in supply and demand of crops or other commodities, weather conditions, agricultural uncertainty or governmental incentives and controls.\nWe generally do not have long-term supply contracts with our ingredient suppliers. The length of the contracts is fixed for a period of time, typically up to a year or for a season and/or a crop year. In addition, some of our raw materials are sole-sourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers. We may not be able to renew or enter into new contracts with our existing suppliers following the expiration of such contracts on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We purchase some of our raw materials in the open market, and although we aim to enter into fixed price and/or fixed quantity contracts for a pre-determined amount of our ingredients to reduce short term price volatility in certain commodities, these activities may not successfully reduce or stabilize the costs of our raw materials and supplies. If commodity prices increase or our procurement or future hedging activities are not effective, we may not be able to increase our prices to offset these increased costs. Moreover, our competitors may be better able than we are to implement productivity initiatives or effect price increases or to otherwise pass along cost increases to their customers.\nCertain of our raw materials and supplies are imported from outside of the United States. Our ability to import these materials and supplies at a competitive price depends on our ability to properly manage our global supply chain, including our import processes. Changes in port management and procedures, the availability and cost of freight, regulatory changes, and our efforts to comply with import and export regulations in various countries may affect our supply chain and ultimately the pricing and availability of our products.\nIn addition, we face competition from other companies producing pet food and human food that are purchasing the same raw materials and supplies that are used in our products. This competition may\nlead to increased ingredient prices and affect our ability to produce sufficient volume of our product due to scarcity of certain ingredients.\nSome of the raw materials we use are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes and pestilences and may be impacted by climate change and other factors. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce supplies of raw materials, increase the prices of raw materials, increase costs of storing raw materials and interrupt or delay our production schedules if harvests are delayed. Our competitors may not be impacted by such weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their suppliers and operations.\nWe conduct risk-based assessments of raw materials included in our products and implement monitoring of raw materials as appropriate based on those assessments. We may not be able to identify all relevant risks in a timely manner, if at all. If any of our raw materials or supplies are alleged or proven to include contaminants affecting the safety or quality of our products (including, for example, bacteria, mold or as a result of animal or human-related pandemics, such as outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, foot-and-mouth disease, avian influenza, or any other disease), we may need to find alternate materials or supplies, delay production of our products, discard or otherwise dispose of our products, or engage in a product recall, all of which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to detect or prevent the use of ingredients from our suppliers which do not meet our quality standards. Any use of such ingredients may result in a loss of consumer confidence in our brand and products and a reduction in our sales if consumers perceive us as being untruthful in our marketing and advertising and may materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our sources of raw materials and supplies are terminated or affected by adverse prices, weather conditions or quality concerns, we may not be able to identify alternate sources of raw materials or other supplies that meet our quality controls and standards to sustain our sales volumes or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur Heartland Joplin Facilities may not operate in accordance with our expectations.\nIn 2014, we commenced manufacturing operations at our Joplin Dry Food Facility. Opening this facility and bringing this facility up to full production required significant capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which diverted resources from our business operations. Maintaining and optimizing operations at our Joplin Dry Food Facility will continue to require certain capital expenditures as well as attention of our management and other personnel. In addition, we recently commenced operations at the Joplin Treats Facility, which is our first treats facility and is adjacent to our Joplin Dry Food Facility.\nWe expect our Joplin Dry Food Facility to provide us with in-house dry food manufacturing for approximately half of our forecasted dry food production needs over the next several years. This facility, however, may not provide us with the anticipated benefits. In addition, any substantial delay in ramping\nup the Joplin Treats Facility to full production on our schedule may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and achieve our expected financial performance. Our Heartland Joplin Facilities are located in an area susceptible to tornadoes and other adverse weather conditions, and the damage or destruction of such facilities due to fire or natural disasters, including tornadoes, power failures or disruptions or equipment breakdown, failure or substandard performance could severely affect our ability to operate these facilities. Our Heartland Joplin Facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult or costly to replace or repair and may require substantial lead-time to do so. For example, if we were unable to use our Heartland Joplin Facilities, the use of any new facilities would need to be approved by various federal and local planning, zoning and health agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Missouri Department of Health and the Missouri Department of Agriculture, and registered with the FDA, in addition to passing our internal quality assurance requirements which may take up to 18 months and would result in significant production delays. We also may not be able to find suitable alternatives with contract manufacturers on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. In addition, we may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of regulatory issues, equipment failure or delays in deliveries. Any such disruption or unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in our business and loss of inventory and/or data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. We have property and business disruption insurance coverage in place for our Heartland Joplin Facilities. However, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may not successfully complete and open our additional dry food manufacturing facility or our additional dry food manufacturing facility may not operate in accordance with our expectations.\nWe are in the process of expanding our internal manufacturing capacity under our previously announced multi-year capital investment program. While we recently commenced operations at our Joplin Treats Facility, we also are close to completing the expansion of our internal manufacturing capabilities to provide additional dry production capacity commencing in the second half of 2018 at our Heartland Richmond Facility. We may experience substantial delays in completing the construction and implementation of our Heartland Richmond Facility. Any substantial delay in opening our Heartland Richmond Facility, registering the facility with appropriate regulatory authorities or bringing the facility up to full production on our schedule may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and achieve our expected financial performance. Opening this facility and bringing it up to full production will require additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which will divert resources from our existing business operations. If we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete this projects or fail to implement the projects effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Even if our Heartland Richmond Facility begins operations according to our schedule, this facility may not provide us with the benefits that we expect to receive. If this facility do not provide us with the benefits that we expect to receive, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to manage our manufacturing and supply chain effectively which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe must accurately forecast demand for our products in order to ensure we have adequate available manufacturing capacity. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions that may cause our estimates\nto be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether our own manufacturing capacity or contract manufacturing capacity) in order to meet the demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer or consumer demand and harm our brand and our business. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand. If we underestimate demand, we risk having inadequate supplies. We also face the risk of having too much inventory on hand that may reach its expiration date and become unsaleable, and we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory. If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease.\nWe rely upon a number of third parties to manage or provide distribution centers for our products.\nIn addition to our Heartland Joplin warehouse, which we operate, our distribution operations include the use of third-party distribution centers as well as the use of third parties to manage such distribution centers. These third-party distribution centers may distribute our products as well as the products of other companies. Our distribution operations at these third-party distribution centers could be disrupted by a number of factors, including labor issues, failure to meet customer standards, bankruptcy or other financial issues affecting our third-party providers, or other issues affecting any such third party\u2019s ability to service our customers effectively. If there is any disruption of these distribution centers, our business may be materially adversely affected. As we expand the distribution of products in the FDM channel, we may not be able to accurately forecast our manufacturing or warehousing needs or may encounter difficulty obtaining additional storage if and when such additional storage is needed.\nIf we continue to grow, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nOur net sales have grown from $1,027.4 million in 2015 to $1,149.8 million in 2016 to $1,274.6 million in 2017. Our historical rapid growth, and continued growth as a CPG company, has placed and, if continued, may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. Our organizational structure may become more complex as we add additional staff, and we may require valuable resources to grow and continue to improve our operational, management and financial controls without undermining our strong corporate culture of entrepreneurship and collaboration that has been a strong contributor to our growth so far. If we are not able to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur market size estimate may prove to be inaccurate.\nData for pet food retail sales is collected for most, but not all channels, and as a result, it is difficult to estimate the size of the market and predict the rate at which the market for our products will grow, if at all. While our market size estimate was made in good faith, is within the range of a major independent\nthird-party estimate of the U.S. pet food industry and is based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, this estimate may not prove to be accurate.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand in and into countries in which we have no prior operating experience.\nWe have expanded and intend to continue to expand our global footprint by entering into new markets. As we expand our business into new countries we will encounter foreign economic, political, regulatory, personnel, technological, language barriers and other risks that may increase our expenses or delay our ability to become profitable in such countries. These risks include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ncustomers in some foreign countries potentially having longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nchanges in local tax laws, tax rates in some countries that may exceed those of the United States or Canada and lower earnings due to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activity;\n\u2022\nport conditions and the pricing of freight transport;\n\u2022\nthe credit risk of local customers and distributors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nany attempt by the Trump administration to withdraw from or materially modify the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) and certain other international trade agreements;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in legal, regulatory or tax requirements;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in import and export regulations, processes and procedures;\n\u2022\ndifferences in culture and trends in foreign countries with respect to pets and pet care;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties associated with managing a large global organization;\n\u2022\nthe risk that certain governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including nationalization of private enterprise;\n\u2022\nnon-compliance with applicable currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations or other similar regulations;\n\u2022\nviolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or comparable local anticorruption laws by acts of agents and other intermediaries whom we have limited or no ability to control; and\n\u2022\nviolations of regulations enforced by the U.S. Department of The Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control.\nIn addition, our expansion into new countries may require significant resources and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which will divert resources from our existing business operations. As we expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our operations outside of the United States and Canada.\nWe may face challenges growing our line of veterinary exclusive therapeutic products.\nWe have launched, and are seeking to expand, our line of veterinary exclusive therapeutic products. This market segment is dominated by divisions of larger companies that have made substantial investments in their veterinary exclusive therapeutic products over many years and have developed close relationships with veterinarians and veterinary clinics. If we are not able successfully to develop relationships with veterinarians and veterinary clinics, or engage with academics and new veterinary professionals, we may not be able to grow our sales of veterinary exclusive products. Our competitors continue to grow their lines of products in this market segment, resulting in increased competition for our line of products. In addition, these companies have a significantly larger number of veterinary sales representatives, and may have greater financial resources and the ability to fulfill product orders more quickly than we do.\nOur expansion into the veterinary exclusive segment will require significant resources and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which will divert resources from our existing business operations. As a result, we may not be able successfully to implement our veterinary exclusive therapeutic product growth strategy and may need to change our strategy. If we fail to implement this growth strategy or if we continue to invest resources in this strategy and it ultimately proves unsuccessful, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of or investments in new or complementary businesses, facilities, technologies or products, or through strategic alliances, and the failure to manage acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFrom time to time we may consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in new or complementary businesses, facilities, technologies or products, or enter into strategic alliances, that may enhance our capabilities, expand our manufacturing network, add new brands to our portfolio, complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets. Potential and completed acquisitions and investments and other strategic alliances involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nproblems assimilating the purchased business, facilities, technologies or products;\n\u2022\nissues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, contract manufacturers, retail partners and distribution customers;\n\u2022\nincreased complexity of running a broader portfolio of products, brands or facilities, which may conflict with our existing business;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nincreased legal and accounting compliance costs.\nWe do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions or strategic relationships we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such transactions on favorable terms or at all, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, facilities, technologies or products into our business or retain any key personnel, suppliers or customers. Our ability successfully to grow through strategic transactions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable target businesses, facilities, technologies and products and to obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time-consuming and may disrupt our ongoing business and prevent management from focusing on our operations. If we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, facilities, technologies and products effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur substantial indebtedness may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $398.0 million of indebtedness, consisting of amounts outstanding under our term loan facilities, and a total availability of $120.0 million under our revolving credit facility. Our indebtedness could have significant consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of funding growth, working capital, capital expenditures, investments or other cash requirements;\n\u2022\nreducing our flexibility to adjust to changing business conditions or obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our term loan facilities are at variable rates;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility in operating our business; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes.\nIf our cash from operations is not sufficient to meet our current or future operating needs, expenditures and debt service obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to generate cash to meet our operating needs, expenditures and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance and financial condition, which will be affected by financial, business, economic legislative, regulatory and other factors, including potential changes in costs, pricing, the success of product innovation and marketing, competitive pressure and consumer preferences. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and other cash needs, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities restrict our ability to take these actions and we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities can terminate their commitments to loan money, can declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, any downgrade of our debt ratings by any of the major rating agencies, which could result from our financial performance, acquisitions or other factors, would also negatively impact our access to additional debt financing (including leasing) or refinancing on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we are successful in taking any such alternative actions, such actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could harm our competitive position or require us to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur trademarks such as \u201cBlue Buffalo,\u201d \u201cLifeSource Bits,\u201d \u201cLife Protection Formula,\u201d \u201cBLUE Wilderness,\u201d \u201cBLUE Basics,\u201d \u201cBLUE Freedom,\u201d and \u201cBLUE Natural Veterinary Diet\u201d along with the BLUE shield logo, the Blue Buffalo figure logo and the tag line \u201cLove them like family. Feed them like family.\u201d are valuable assets that support our brand and consumers\u2019 perception of our products. We rely on trademark, copyright, trade secret, patent and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our trademarks, trade names, proprietary information, technologies and processes. Our non-disclosure agreements and confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information, which could harm our competitive position. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks, inventions and other proprietary information and patents in some foreign countries. We may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. Further, third parties may also engage in litigation or similar activities to challenge the validity and scope of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations. If we fail to protect our intellectual property, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could result in substantial damages and diversion of management\u2019s efforts and attention.\nWe have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of third-party intellectual property. The steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement or other violation of the intellectual property of others may not be successful. From time to time, third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and may continue to do so in the future.\nWhile we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties and/or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, we may from time to time be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others. For example, patent applications in the United States and some foreign countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our products or processes. If patents later issue on these applications, we may be found liable for subsequent infringement.\nAny claims that our products or processes infringe these rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could, among other things, be required to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages (potentially treble damages in the United States);\n\u2022\ncease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue the use of the infringing processes;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing processes; and\n\u2022\nenter into licensing arrangements from the third party claiming infringement, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or may not be available at all.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, our ability to compete could be affected or our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nA failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, or processes may materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our sales and marketing, accounting and financial and legal and compliance functions, engineering and product development tasks, research and development data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control,\nincluding fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, ransomware and computer viruses. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate or our failure to effectively implement new systems could disrupt our entire operation and could result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and a loss of important information. Further, to the extent that we may have customer or consumer information in our databases, any unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, such information could result in claims under data protection laws and regulations. If any of these risks materialize, our reputation and our ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation and we may incur material costs in order to comply with existing or future laws and regulation, and our failure to comply may result in enforcement, recalls and other adverse actions.\nWe are subject to a broad range of federal, state and local laws and regulations intended to protect public health, natural resources and the environment. See \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation.\u201d Our operations are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the FDA, the Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\"), and by various state, local and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products, including food safety standards.\nAmong other regulatory requirements, the FDA reviews the inclusion of specific claims in pet food labeling, such as claims regarding \u201chairball control\u201d and \u201curinary tract health.\u201d We currently produce pet food products, such as cat food with hairball management claims, which undergo FDA pre-market review. These products, as well as other of our products, such as those in our BLUE Natural Veterinary Diet line, provide all or most of the nutrients in support of an animal\u2019s total daily nutrient needs but are also labeled or marketed with claims that may suggest that they are intended to treat or prevent disease, thereby potentially meeting the statutory definitions of both a food and a drug. The FDA recently issued guidance containing a list of specific factors it will consider in determining whether to initiate enforcement action against such products if they do not comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to drugs. These factors include, among other things, whether the product is only made available through or under the direction of a veterinarian and does not present a known safety risk when used as labeled. While we believe that we market our products in compliance with the policy articulated in FDA\u2019s guidance and in other claim-specific guidance, the FDA may disagree or may classify some of our products differently than we do, and may impose more stringent regulations which could lead to alleged regulatory violations, enforcement actions and product recalls. For example, a manufacturer of animal drugs must comply with the FDA\u2019s GMPs for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and is subject to FDA inspection to confirm its compliance. In addition, we may produce more products that may be subject to FDA pre-market review, including new products we introduce to the Therapeutic market segment.\nThe FDA Food Safety Modernization Act provides direct recall authority to the FDA and includes a number of other provisions designed to enhance food safety, including increased inspections by the FDA of domestic and foreign food facilities and increased review of food products imported into the United States. In addition to periodic government agency inspections affecting our operations generally, our Heartland Joplin Facilities are, and our Heartland Richmond Facility will be, subject to mandatory continuous on-site inspections by the FDA, and certain of our raw material suppliers are subject to\nmandatory continuous on-site inspection by the USDA. The FSMA also mandates that the FDA adopt preventative controls to be implemented by pet food facilities in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. Under the FSMA, the FDA finalized the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP), Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals on September 17, 2015. The final rule has staggered compliance dates based on the business size. There are two components of the final rule with different compliance dates including CGMP requirements and the Preventive Controls. Blue Buffalo was required to be in compliance with the CGMP by September 2016 and was required to be in compliance with the Preventive Controls by September 2017. The FDA also finalized the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) on November 27, 2015, with a compliance date of July 2017. The third relevant regulation is the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food, which had a compliance date of April 6, 2017. We believe that we are in compliance with those regulations in effect that are relevant to our business.\nComplying with government regulation can be costly or may otherwise adversely affect our business. Our business is also affected by import and export controls and similar laws and regulations, both in the United States and elsewhere. Issues such as national security or health and safety, which may slow or otherwise restrict imports or exports, may adversely affect our business. Violations of or liability under any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties against us, revocation or modification of applicable permits, environmental investigations or remedial activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, warning or untitled letters or cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance, among other things. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur (directly, or indirectly through our contract manufacturers) material costs to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls. In addition, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to additional regulatory requirements, including compliance with the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental regulatory agencies (including the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources) and the National Labor Relations Board. Such laws and regulations generally have become more stringent over time and may become more so in the future. Costs of compliance, and the impacts on us of any non-compliance, with any such laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no single U.S. government regulated definition of the term \u201cnatural\u201d for use in the pet food industry. On November 10, 2015, the FDA requested public comments on the use of the term \u201cnatural\u201d in the labeling of human food products. Comments were due on or before May 10, 2016. It is unclear whether the FDA will engage in rulemaking and, if so, whether any resulting regulation would impact the pet food industry.\nCurrently, many states in the United States have adopted the AAFCO definition of the term \u201cnatural\u201d with respect to the pet food industry, which means no synthetic additives or synthetic processing except vitamins, minerals or certain trace nutrients, and only ingredients that are derived solely from plant, animal or mined sources. Certain groups and individuals have proposed requiring pet food labeling to disclose the presence or use of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. We may incur material costs to comply with any new GMO-labeling requirements, and could be subject to liabilities if we fail to timely comply. If any of these changes materialize, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations are also subject to the laws of, and regulation by governmental authorities in, Canada, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and provincial and local regulations; Mexico, including the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food; Japan, including the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Ministry of the Environment; and comparable regulators in other countries where our products are sold.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings relating to our business operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to allegations, and may be party to legal claims and regulatory proceedings, relating to our business operations. Such allegations, claims and proceedings may be brought by third parties, including our customers, employees, governmental or regulatory bodies or competitors. Defending against such claims and proceedings is costly and time consuming and may divert management\u2019s attention and personnel resources from our normal business operations, and the outcome of many of these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these claims or proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, a judgment, a fine or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur, or injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management as well as team members within stores.\nOur continued growth and success requires us to hire, retain and develop our leadership bench. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key executives, as well as provide for the succession of senior management, our growth and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain employees who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to represent our brand effectively, including our Pet Detectives who interact with consumers in stores. If we are unable to attract, train and retain new employees and new team members to act as Pet Detectives, this could delay or prevent the implementation of our business strategy and in turn, lead to fewer sales of our products. In addition, we have in the past been a defendant in a purported class action by former and current Pet Detectives, which alleged certain violations of wage and labor laws in California and Oregon, and we may be subject to other claims in the future.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nTogether, Invus and The Bishop Family Limited Partnership constitute a \u201cgroup\u201d that controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Under NASDAQ rules a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and such a company may elect not to comply\nwith certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including the requirements (i) that a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (ii) to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities and (iii) to have director nominations be made, or recommended to the full Board of Directors, by independent directors or by a nominations committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and to adopt a written charter or board resolution addressing the nominations process. We have elected to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nInvus controls us and its interests may conflict with yours in the future.\nInvus beneficially owns approximately 44.7% of our common stock. Invus effectively controls us and will effectively be able to control the election and removal of our directors and thereby determine our corporate and management policies, including potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales, amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and other significant corporate transactions for so long as Invus and its affiliates retain significant ownership of us. This concentration of our ownership may delay or deter possible changes in control of the Company, which may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock. So long as Invus continues to own a significant amount of our combined voting power, Invus will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions and, so long as Invus and its affiliates collectively own at least 5% of all outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, it will be able to appoint individuals to our Board of Directors under the amended and restated investor rights agreement we have entered into with Invus. The interests of Invus may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nIn the ordinary course of their business activities, Invus and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of Invus, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Invus also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, Invus may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs, and are subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of being a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and costs of recruiting and retaining non-executive directors. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and NASDAQ. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. These rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Our management will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nThe market price of shares or our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly results of operations, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments, and adverse publicity about our industry or individual scandals. In response, the market price of shares of our common stock could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid or at all.\nIn the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. In addition, we are required to furnish with each annual report on Form 10-K, a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accountants are required to attest to the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, in each case pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating.\nThe process of designing, implementing, maintaining and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation is time-consuming, costly, and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the NASDAQ, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, including restrictions under our senior secured credit facilities and other indebtedness we may incur, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nBlue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own and, as such, it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses, including future dividend payments, if any.\nOur operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments, if any, is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. We do not currently expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future; however, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility significantly restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nYou may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,302 million shares of common stock authorized but unissued. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of common stock and options relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and\nconditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. As of December 31, 2017, we have 205,978 shares reserved for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Purchase and Option Plan of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (the \u201c2012 Plan\u201d) and 7,552,780 shares reserved for issuance under the Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d).\nAny common stock that we issue, including under the 2012 Plan, the 2015 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, may result in additional dilution to you.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, including sales by Invus, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nShares held by Invus and certain of our directors, officers and employees are eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to an investor rights agreement entered into on July 10, 2012 and amended and restated on January 21, 2015, we granted Invus the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of its shares of our common stock under the Securities Act.\nIf Invus exercises its registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of the Company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. Among other things:\n\u2022\nalthough we do not have a stockholder rights plan, these provisions allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nthese provisions provide for a classified Board of Directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nthese provisions require advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\n\u2022\nthese provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the date on which Invus, The Bishop Family Limited Partnership, or The Bishop Family Partnership, and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nthese provisions provide for the removal of directors only for cause and only upon affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors if Invus, The Bishop Family Partnership and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock; and\n\u2022\nthese provisions require the amendment of certain provisions only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors if Invus, The Bishop Family Partnership and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 40% of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue 150 million shares of our preferred stock, subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules and regulations and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as shares of preferred stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers, preferences and rights of these additional series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with our common stock, which may reduce its value.", "PERMNO": 15494, "SIC": 2040, "TIC": "BUFF."}
