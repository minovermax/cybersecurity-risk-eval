RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K, including the exhibits hereto and the information incorporated by reference herein, as well as our 2022 Annual Report to Shareholders (our \u201c2022 Annual Report\u201d), contain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Information regarding activities, events and developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including, but not limited to, information relating to our future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value, are forward-looking statements based on management\u2019s estimates, assumptions and projections. Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future economic and financial condition and results of operations, the plans and objectives of management and our assumptions regarding our performance and such plans and objectives, as well as the amount and timing of repurchases of our Common Shares or other uses of cash flows. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified through the use of words such as \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cprojected,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cforesee,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould\u201d and other similar words and variations.\nForward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K and our 2022 Annual Report are predictions only and actual results could differ materially from management\u2019s expectations due to a variety of factors, including those described below. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such risk factors.\nThe forward-looking statements that we make in this Form 10-K and our 2022 Annual Report are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions regarding future events and speak only as of their dates. We disclaim any obligation to update developments of these risk factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements that we make, or to make corrections to reflect future events or developments, except as required by the federal securities laws.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we underestimate or overestimate demand for our products and do not maintain appropriate inventory levels, our net sales and/or working capital could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to manage our inventory levels to meet our customers\u2019 demand for our products is important for our business. Our production levels and inventory management goals for our products are based on estimates of demand, taking into account production capacity, timing of shipments, and inventory levels. If we overestimate or underestimate either channel or retail demand for any of our products during a given season, we may not maintain appropriate inventory levels, which could negatively impact our net sales, profit margins, net earnings, working capital and/or cash flow, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, result in loss of customers, or cause us to incur excess and obsolete inventory charges or excess warehouse storage costs.\nFor example, during fiscal 2022, a significant decrease in sales volume coupled with a recent expansion of our production and supply chain resulted in higher fixed costs and inventory levels. These factors negatively impacted our net sales, profit margins, net earnings and operating cash flow.\nDisruptions in availability or increases in the prices of raw materials, fuel or transportation costs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe source many of our commodities and other raw materials on a global basis. The general availability and price of those raw materials can be affected by numerous forces beyond our control, including political instability, trade restrictions and other government regulations, duties and tariffs, price controls, changes in currency exchange rates and weather. A significant disruption in the availability or price of any of our key raw materials could negatively impact our business.\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, the indirect impacts of the conflict in Ukraine, including increases in the cost of raw materials (including fertilizer inputs such as urea) and commodities (including the price of oil), supply chain and logistics challenges and foreign currency volatility. Increases in the prices of key commodities and other raw materials could adversely affect our ability to manage our cost structure. Market conditions may limit our ability to raise selling prices to offset increases in our raw material costs. Further, sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers and/or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur proprietary technologies can limit our ability to locate or utilize alternative inputs for certain products. For certain inputs, new sources of supply may have to be qualified under regulatory standards, which can require additional investment and delay bringing a product to market. We utilize hedge agreements periodically to fix the prices of a portion of our urea and fuel needs. The hedge agreements are designed to mitigate the earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with the costs of urea and fuel. In periods of declining prices, utilizing these hedge agreements may effectively increase our expenditures for these raw materials.\nThe effects of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and any possible recurrence of other similar types of pandemics, or any other widespread public health emergencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Public health responses have included national pandemic preparedness and response plans, travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, event postponements and cancellations and closures of facilities including local schools and businesses. The global pandemic and actions taken to contain COVID-19 have disrupted the global economy and financial markets. Increases in COVID-19 cases may increase the possibility of further shutdowns, production delays, staffing and resource challenges which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have actively addressed the pandemic\u2019s ongoing impact on our employees, operations, customers, consumers, and communities, by, among other things, implementing contingency plans, making operational adjustments where necessary, and providing assistance to organizations that support front-line workers. The first priority of our pandemic response has been and remains the health, safety and well-being of our employees which we have addressed by following Center for Disease Control health guidelines and applicable state and local guidelines. While we believe that these actions should enable us to maintain our operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so as a result of the unpredictability of the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the responses of local, state, federal and foreign governmental authorities to the pandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depends on future developments that are highly uncertain, rapidly evolving and difficult to predict at this time, including:\n\u2022the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic;\n\u2022the availability, usage and effectiveness of vaccines or alternative treatments;\n\u2022the ability of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, contractors and third-party logistics providers to meet their obligations to us (including supplying us with essential raw materials, components and finished products, or shipping finished goods to customers) on a timely basis and at previously anticipated costs without significant disruption, and our ability to identify alternative sources of materials and services, if necessary;\n\u2022our ability to continue to meet our customers\u2019 needs in the event of the suspension or interruption of essential elements of our manufacturing and supply arrangements and activities such as the continued availability of raw materials, transportation, labor and production capacity and at previously anticipated costs;\n\u2022the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers (including retailers and distributors), including their ability to remain open, continue to sell our products, pay for the products purchased from us on a timely basis or at all and collect payment from their customers;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial and credit markets and economic activity generally, including our ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants, access lending, capital markets, and other sources of liquidity when needed on reasonable terms or at all\u037e\n\u2022higher costs of labor, commodities, components, parts and accessories and/or transportation related costs; and\n\u2022the demand for our products, which may be impacted by, among other things, the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, travel restrictions or financial hardship, shifts in short- or long-term consumer behavior including moving from one or more of our more discretionary and profitable products to less profitable products, or stockpiling and similar pantry-loading activity that could negatively impact future demand.\nNegative developments with respect to any of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nBecause of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, our top customers, or a material reduction in the inventory of our products that they carry, could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur top two retail customers, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, together accounted for 43% of our fiscal 2022 net sales and 46% of our outstanding accounts receivable as of September 30, 2022. The loss of, or reduction in orders from any major customer for any reason (including, for example, changes in a retailer\u2019s strategy, reduction in inventories of our products that they maintain, claims or allegations that our products or products we market on behalf of third parties are unsafe, a decline in consumer demand, regulatory, legal or other external pressures or a change in marketing strategy), and customer disputes regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our inability to collect accounts receivable from one of our major customers, or a significant deterioration in the financial condition of one of these customers, including a bankruptcy filing or a liquidation, could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not have long-term sales agreements with, or other contractual assurances as to future sales to, any of our major retail customers. In addition, continued consolidation in the retail industry has resulted in an increasingly concentrated retail base, and as a result, we are significantly dependent upon sales to key retailers who have significant bargaining strength. To the extent such concentration continues to occur, our net sales and income from operations may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of, or other adverse developments involving our relationship with, one or more of our key customers. In addition, our business may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailers, such as inventory reductions, limitations on access to shelf space, price demands and other conditions.\nWe may not successfully develop new product lines and products or improve existing product lines and products.\nOur future success depends on creating and successfully competing in markets for our products including our ability to improve our existing product lines and products and to develop and manufacture new product lines and products to meet evolving consumer needs. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in developing and manufacturing new product lines and products or product innovations that satisfy consumer needs or achieve market acceptance, or that we will develop, manufacture and market new product lines and products or product innovations in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and manufacture new product lines and products or product innovations, our ability to maintain or grow our market share may be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the development and introduction of new product lines and products and product innovations require substantial research and development expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if such new product lines, products or innovations do not achieve market acceptance.\nMany of the products we manufacture and market contain active ingredients that are subject to regulatory approval. The need to obtain such approval could delay the launch of new products or product innovations that contain active ingredients or otherwise prevent us from developing and manufacturing certain products and product innovations.\nOur marketing activities may not be successful.\nWe invest substantial resources in advertising, consumer promotions and other marketing activities to maintain, extend and expand our brand image. Negative publicity about us or our brands, including publicity regarding product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and matters related to climate impact and waste management) and other sustainability or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could occur and could be widely and rapidly disseminated, including through the use of social media sites. There can be no assurances that our marketing strategies will be effective or that the amount we invest in advertising activities will result in a corresponding increase in sales of our products. If our marketing initiatives are unsuccessful, including our ability to leverage new media such as digital media and social networks to reach existing and potential customers or our brands suffer damage to reputation due to real or perceived quality issues which reputational damage can be quickly multiplied by social media, we will have incurred significant expenses without the benefit of higher revenues.\nThe highly competitive nature of our markets could adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow revenues.\nEach of our operating segments participates in highly competitive markets. Our products compete against national and regional products and private label products produced by various suppliers. Many of our competitors sell their products at prices lower than ours. Our most price sensitive customers may trade down to lower priced products during challenging economic times or if current economic conditions worsen. We compete primarily on the basis of product innovation, product quality, product performance, value, brand strength, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support, the strength of our relationships with major retailers and advertising. Some of our competitors have significant financial resources. The strong competition that we face in all of our markets may prevent us from achieving our revenue goals, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur manufacturing operations, including our reliance on third-party manufacturers, could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to maintain or develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing capability and processes that will enable us to meet the quality, price, design and product standards or production volumes required to successfully manufacture our products. Even if we are successful in maintaining and developing our manufacturing capabilities and processes, we may not be able to do so in time to satisfy the requirements of our customers.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture certain products. This reliance generates a number of risks, including decreased control over the production and related processes, which could lead to production delays or interruptions and inferior product quality control. In addition, performance problems at these third-party manufacturers could lead to cost overruns, shortages or other problems, which could increase our costs of production or result in delivery shortages or delays to our customers.\nIn addition, if one or more of our third-party manufacturers becomes insolvent or unwilling to continue to manufacture products of acceptable quality, at acceptable costs and in a timely manner, our ability to deliver products to our retail customers could be significantly impaired. Substitute manufacturers may not be available or, if available, may be unwilling or unable to manufacture the products we need on acceptable terms. Moreover, if customer demand for our products increases, we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current third-party manufacturers, or others, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing outside of the U.S. and risks from tariffs and/or international trade wars.\nWe import many of our raw materials and finished goods from countries outside of the United States, including but not limited to China. Our import operations are subject to complex customs laws, regulations, tax requirements, and trade regulations, such as tariffs set by governments, either through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. Tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly goods from China, have increased the cost of the goods we purchase. Additional tariffs could be imposed by the U.S. with relatively short notice to us. These governmental actions could have, and any similar future actions may have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The overall effect of these risks is that our costs may increase or we may experience supply disruptions, which in turn may result in lower profitability if we are unable to offset such increases through higher prices, and/or that we may suffer a decline in sales if our customers do not accept price increases.\nOur reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in disruptions to our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nAlthough we continue to implement risk mitigation strategies for single-source suppliers, we also rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain of our raw materials, product components and other necessary supplies, including certain active ingredients used in our products. If we are unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relationships, if we are unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels needed for our business, or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experience other financial distress, we could experience disruptions in production, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant interruption in the operation of our or our suppliers\u2019 facilities could impact our capacity to produce products and service our customers, which could adversely affect revenues and earnings.\nOperations at our and our suppliers\u2019 facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including fire, flooding or other natural disasters, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war, terrorism, government shut-downs and work stoppages. A significant interruption in the operation of our or our suppliers\u2019 facilities, including as a result of COVID-19, could significantly impact our capacity to produce products and service our customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and financial position, particularly with respect to products that we manufacture at a limited number of facilities, such as our fertilizer and liquid products.\nDisruptions to transportation channels that we use to distribute our products may adversely affect our margins and profitability.\nWe may experience disruptions to the transportation channels used to distribute our products, including increased congestion, a lack of transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, import or export controls or delays, and labor disputes or shortages. Disruptions in our trucking capacity may result in reduced sales or increased costs, including the additional use of more expensive or less efficient alternatives to meet demand. Congestion can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs, reduction in our profitability or reduced sales. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shifts in demand or changes in our extended supply chain has resulted in several disruptions and delays, as well as quantity limits and price increases, in our transportation channels.\nClimate change and unfavorable weather conditions could adversely impact financial results.\nOur consumer lawn and garden net sales in any one year are susceptible to weather conditions in the markets in which our products are sold. For instance, periods of abnormally wet or dry weather can adversely impact the sale of certain products, while increasing demand for other products with the overall impact to the Company difficult to predict.\nClimate change continues to receive increasing global attention. The possible effects of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing storm patterns and intensities, changing temperature levels and changes in legislation, regulation and international accords. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities and energy, which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require.\nConsumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of concerns regarding the impact of climate change, governmental regulations and public perceptions. We will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. Climate change may decrease demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, fluctuating climatic conditions may result in unpredictable modifications in the manner in which consumers garden or their attitudes towards gardening, making it more difficult for us to provide appropriate products to appropriate markets in time to meet consumer demand.\nAdditionally, climate change may present additional physical risks to our operations (including damage to our manufacturing and distribution facilities or the manufacturing and distribution facilities of our suppliers) which could disrupt our supply chain or harm or disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nCertain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders are increasing their focus on corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. From time to time, we communicate certain initiatives, including goals, regarding environmental matters, responsible sourcing and social investments, including pursuant to our Corporate Responsibility Report. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, to achieve such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Our business could be negatively impacted by such matters. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain of our products may be purchased for use in new and emerging industries or segments and/or be subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions.\nWe sell products, including hydroponic gardening products, that end users may purchase for use in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis, that may not grow or achieve market acceptance in a manner that we can predict. The demand for these products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments. For example, our Hawthorne segment sales volume has decreased due to an oversupply of cannabis, which has driven cannabis wholesale prices down significantly and has resulted in a decrease in indoor and outdoor cultivation. The oversupply has been driven by the impacts of increased licensing activity across the U.S., as well as significant capital investment in the cannabis production marketplace over the past several years and the market impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, we sell products that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis, that are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions. For example, certain countries and 39 U.S. states have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis.\nIf we are unable to effectively execute our e-commerce business, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.\nWe sell certain of our products over the Internet through our online store and other e-commerce retail platforms. The success of our e-commerce business depends on our investment in these platforms, consumer preferences and buying trends relating to e-commerce, and our ability to both maintain the continuous operation of our online store and our fulfillment operations that support both our own and our retail customers\u2019 e-commerce platforms. It is essential that these platforms provide a shopping experience that will generate orders and return visits to the respective platforms.\nWe are also vulnerable to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce business, including: changes in required technology interfaces; website downtime and other technical failures; costs and technical issues associated with website software, systems and technology investments and upgrades; data and system security; system failures, disruptions and breaches and the costs to address and remedy such failures, disruptions or breaches; computer viruses; and changes in and compliance with applicable federal and state regulations. In addition, our efforts to remain competitive with technology trends,\nincluding the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others, may increase our costs and may not increase sales or attract consumers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales of our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nAdditionally, the success of our e-commerce business and the satisfaction of our consumers depend on the timely receipt of our products by our consumers. The efficient delivery of our products to our consumers requires that our distribution centers have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce operations and any anticipated increased levels that may occur as a result of the growth of our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution centers, or if any distribution centers shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire or other natural disaster, we could face inventory shortages that may result in out of stock conditions in our online store, incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our consumers and experience dissatisfaction from our consumers. Any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation.\nOur operations may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber attack.\nWe rely on information technology systems to conduct business, including communicating with employees and our key retail customers, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products to retail customers and analyzing and reporting results of operations. While we have taken steps to ensure the security of our information technology systems, our systems may nevertheless be vulnerable to computer viruses, security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users. If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly for an extended period of time, whether as a result of a significant cyber incident or otherwise, our ability to communicate internally as well as with our retail customers could be significantly impaired, which may adversely impact our business.\nAdditionally, in the normal course of our business, we collect, store and transmit proprietary and confidential information regarding our customers, employees, suppliers and others, including personally identifiable information. An operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to loss, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of this information about our employees or consumers, which may result in regulatory or other legal proceedings, and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. We also may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly-evolving types of cyber attacks. Any such attacks or precautionary measures taken to prevent anticipated attacks may result in increasing costs, including costs for additional technologies, training and third party consultants. The losses incurred from a breach of data security and operational failures as well as the precautionary measures required to address this evolving risk may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations make us susceptible to the costs and risks associated with operating internationally.\nWe operate manufacturing, sales and service facilities outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, the Netherlands and China. Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022additional costs of compliance with local regulations;\n\u2022historically, in certain countries, higher rates of inflation than in the United States;\n\u2022changes in the economic conditions or consumer preferences or demand for our products in these markets;\n\u2022restrictive actions by multinational governing bodies, foreign governments or subdivisions thereof;\n\u2022changes in foreign labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees;\n\u2022changes in U.S. and foreign laws regarding trade and investment, including the impact of tariffs;\n\u2022less robust protection of our intellectual property under foreign laws; and\n\u2022difficulty in obtaining distribution and support for our products, including the impact of shipping port delays.\nIn addition, our operations outside the United States are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. The costs associated with operating our continuing international business could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the future.\nIn the event the Third Restated Agreement for Monsanto\u2019s consumer Roundup\u00ae products terminates or Monsanto\u2019s consumer Roundup\u00ae business materially declines, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption.\nIf we (i) become insolvent, (ii) commit a material breach, material fraud or material willful misconduct under the Third Restated Agreement, (iii) experience a change of control (subject to certain exceptions), or (iv) impermissibly assign our rights or delegate our obligations under the Third Restated Agreement, Monsanto may terminate the Third Restated Agreement without paying a termination fee to the Company, subject to certain terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable agreements. In addition, if Program EBIT (as defined in the Third Restated Agreement) falls below $50 million in any program year, Monsanto may terminate the Third Restated Agreement without paying a termination fee to the Company, subject to certain terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable agreements.\nMonsanto may also terminate the Third Restated Agreement in the event of (a) a change of control of Monsanto or a sale of the Roundup\u00ae business effective at the end of the fifth full year after providing notice of termination, subject to certain terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable agreements, or (b) Monsanto\u2019s decision to decommission the permits, licenses and registrations needed for, and the trademarks, trade names, packages, copyrights and designs used in, the sale of the Roundup\u00ae products in the lawn and garden market (a \u201cBrand Decommissioning Event\u201d), but, in each case, Monsanto would have to pay a termination fee to the Company.\nIf circumstances exist or otherwise develop that result in a material decline in Monsanto\u2019s consumer Roundup\u00ae business, or in the event of Monsanto\u2019s insolvency or bankruptcy, we would seek to mitigate the impact on us by exercising various rights and remedies under the Third Restated Agreement and applicable law. We cannot, however, provide any assurance that our exercise of such rights or remedies would produce the desired outcomes or that a material decline in Monsanto\u2019s consumer Roundup\u00ae business would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the event that the Third Restated Agreement terminates or Monsanto\u2019s consumer Roundup\u00ae business materially declines, we would lose all, or a substantial portion, of the significant source of earnings and overhead expense absorption the Third Restated Agreement provides.\nFor additional information regarding the Third Restated Agreement including certain of our rights and remedies under the Third Restated Agreement, see \u201cNOTE 7. MARKETING AGREEMENT\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names and issued patents. We have not sought to register every one of our marks either in the United States or in every country in which such mark is used. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the United States with respect to the registered brand names and issued patents we hold. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, proprietary information and/or brand names, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. A successful claim of trademark, patent or other intellectual property infringement against us, or any other successful challenge to the use of our intellectual property, could subject us to damages or prevent us from providing certain products or services, or using certain of our recognized brand names, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon the retention and availability of key personnel and the effective succession of senior management.\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key personnel. Our future operations could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior executives and other key personnel. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our chief executive officer, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur workforce reductions may cause undesirable consequences and our results of operations may be harmed.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we undertook a strategic reduction in our workforce as part of a series of organizational changes and initiatives intended to create operational and management-level efficiencies. This workforce reduction may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in workforce and reduced employee morale, which may cause our employees who were not affected by the reduction in workforce to seek alternate employment. Employees whose positions were eliminated or those who determine to seek alternate employment may seek employment with our competitors.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will not undertake additional workforce reductions or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous or any future workforce reduction plans. In addition, if we continue to reduce our workforce, it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any new product, growth or revenue opportunities and to execute on our business plans. Additionally, reductions in workforce may make it more difficult to recruit and retain new employees. If we need to increase the size of our workforce in the future, we may encounter a competitive hiring market due to labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in the availability of workers and increased wage costs.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and, while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings and are subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the course of our business (see the discussion in \u201cITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u201d of this Form 10-K). Legal proceedings, in general, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts of damages, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products or products we market on behalf of third parties may also result in a decline in sales for a particular product and could damage the reputation or the value of related brands, involve us in litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations and, depending on the nature of the allegations, could negatively impact our reputation or the reputation of products we market on behalf of third parties. Additionally, defending against these legal proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nRisks Related to Our M&A, Lending and Financing Activities\nOur indebtedness could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $2,992.1 million of debt and $1,185.5 million in available borrowings under our credit facility. Our inability to meet restrictive financial and non-financial covenants associated with that debt, or to generate sufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt, could adversely affect our financial condition. For example, our debt level could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, advertising, research and development efforts, pay dividends, repurchase our Common Shares and other general corporate activities;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur ability to make payments on or to refinance our indebtedness, fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay dividends and make repurchases of our Common Shares will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which, to\nsome extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIn addition, our credit facility and the indentures governing our 5.250% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c5.250% Senior Notes\u201d), our 4.500% Senior Notes due 2029 (the \u201c4.500% Senior Notes\u201d), our 4.000% Senior Notes due 2031 (the \u201c4.000% Senior Notes\u201d) and our 4.375% Senior Notes due 2032 (the \u201c4.375% Senior Notes\u201d and, collectively with the 5.250% Senior Notes, the 4.500% Senior Notes, the 4.000% Senior Notes and the 4.375% Senior Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) contain restrictive covenants and cross-default provisions. Our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. For example, under our credit facility the maximum permitted leverage ratio is (i) 6.25 for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 through the first quarter of fiscal 2023, (ii) 6.50 for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023, (iii) 6.25 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and the first quarter of fiscal 2024, (iv) 5.50 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and (v) 4.50 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and thereafter. Our leverage ratio was 6.01 at September 30, 2022. A breach of any of those financial ratio covenants or other covenants could result in a default. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and could cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. We cannot provide any assurance that the holders of such indebtedness would waive a default or that we could pay the accelerated indebtedness in full.\nSubject to compliance with certain covenants under our credit facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes, we may incur additional debt in the future. If we incur additional debt, the risks described above could intensify.\nAcquisitions, other strategic alliances and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions, strategic alliances and investments are an important element of our overall long-term corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or product has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022Assumptions implicit to our acquisition strategy or valuations are not realized.\n\u2022Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n\u2022Failure to successfully further develop the acquired business or product lines.\n\u2022Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company.\n\u2022Integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resources and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions.\n\u2022Transition of operations, users and customers onto our existing platforms.\n\u2022Reliance on the expertise of our strategic partners with respect to market development, sales, local regulatory compliance and other operational matters.\n\u2022Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition and antitrust laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition.\n\u2022In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\n\u2022Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n\u2022Liability for or reputational harm from activities of the acquired company before the acquisition or from our strategic partners, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities.\n\u2022Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments or strategic alliances could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, investments or alliances, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances and investments could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. Also, the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) could adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our Senior Notes.\nNRSROs rate the Senior Notes and the Company based on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the NRSROs can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of the Senior Notes or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could increase our cost of financing, limit our access to the capital markets and have an adverse effect on the market price of the Senior Notes.\nIn September 2022, S&P Global Ratings lowered our issuer credit rating to BB- from BB and lowered its rating on our Senior Notes to B from B+. In June 2022, Moody's Investors Service changed our outlook to negative from stable, affirmed our Ba2 Corporate Family Rating, Ba2-PD Probability of Default Rating and Ba3 rating on the Senior Notes and downgraded our speculative grade liquidity rating to SGL-3 from SGL-2.\nA failure to dispose of assets or businesses in a timely manner may cause the results of the Company to suffer.\nWe evaluate as necessary the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help meet our objectives. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives. Alternatively, we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, we are subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may prevent us from completing the transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside our control could affect future financial results.\nOur lending activities may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAs part of our strategic initiatives, we have provided financing to buyers of certain business assets we have sold and to certain strategic partners. Our exposure to credit losses on these financing balances and strategic investments will depend on the financial condition of these counterparties as well as legal, regulatory and macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as deteriorating conditions in the world economy or in the industries served by the borrowers and federal legalization of the U.S. cannabis market. While we monitor our exposure, there can be no guarantee we will be able to successfully mitigate all of these risks. Credit losses, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUncertainty regarding the LIBOR replacement process and expected discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely impact our current or future debt obligations, including certain hedging arrangements.\nCertain of our debt obligations and instruments, including certain hedging arrangements, use the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a reference rate for establishing the variable interest rate applicable to such debt obligations and instruments. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. However, for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the cessation date has been deferred to June 30, 2023 for the most commonly used tenors (overnight and one, three and six months). This extension to 2023 means that many legacy U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts would terminate before related LIBOR rates cease to be published. The Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has recommended the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short-term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d).\nWe have entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate movements under certain of our variable-rate debt obligations. Using SOFR as the basis on which interest on our variable-rate debt and/or under our interest rate swaps is calculated may result in interest rates and/or payments that do not directly correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form.\nThe potential effect of the replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined.\nOur hedging arrangements expose us to certain counterparty risks.\nIn addition to commodity hedge agreements, we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage the net interest rate risk inherent in our sources of borrowing as well as foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and other approved transactional currency exposures. Utilizing these hedge agreements exposes us to certain counterparty risks. The failure of one or more of the counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the hedge agreements, whether as a result of weakening financial stability or otherwise, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur postretirement-related costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans associated with our U.S. and former international businesses, as well as a postretirement medical plan in the United States for certain retired associates and their dependents. The performance of the financial markets and changes in interest rates impact the funded status of these plans and cause volatility in our postretirement-related costs and future funding requirements. If the financial markets do not provide the expected long-term returns on invested assets, we could be required to make significant pension contributions. Additionally, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements.\nWe utilize third-party actuaries to evaluate assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. In the event we determine that our assumptions should be revised, such as the discount rate or expected return on assets, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. The assumptions we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Company\nCompliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products.\nLaws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways. All pesticide products sold in the United States must comply with FIFRA and most must be registered with the U.S. EPA and similar state agencies. Our inability to obtain or maintain such registrations, or the cancellation of any such registration of our products, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on a variety of factors, including the product(s) involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. We attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute active ingredients, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid or reduce these risks. In addition, in Canada, regulations have been adopted by several provinces that substantially restrict our ability to market and sell certain of our consumer pesticide products.\nUnder the Food Quality Protection Act, enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996, food-use pesticides are evaluated to determine whether there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the cumulative effects of pesticide exposures. Under this Act, the U.S. EPA is evaluating the cumulative and aggregate risks from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in our products, certain of which may be also used on crops processed into various food products, are manufactured by independent third parties and continue to be evaluated by the U.S. EPA as part of this exposure risk assessment. The U.S. EPA or the third-party registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us. We cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of these continuing evaluations.\nIn addition, the use of certain fertilizer and pesticide products (including pesticide products that contain glyphosate) is regulated by various environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may, among other things, ban the use of certain ingredients contained in such products or require (i) that only certified or professional users apply the product, (ii) that certain products be used only on certain types of locations, (iii) users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, and/or (iv) notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future. Even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations and licenses, we cannot provide assurance that our products, particularly pesticide products, will not cause or be alleged to cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances, particularly when used improperly or contrary to instructions. The costs of compliance, remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially adversely affect future quarterly or annual operating results.\nOur products and operations may be subject to increased regulatory and environmental scrutiny in jurisdictions in which we do business. For example, we are subject to regulations relating to our harvesting of peat for our growing media business which has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny. In the United States, state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to an agreed-upon condition. In some locations, we have been\nrequired to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water. In Canada, our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of regulation.\nIn addition to the laws and regulations already described, various governmental agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, the remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation of the presence of certain regulated materials, as well as related costs of investigation and remediation of damage to natural resources, at various properties, including our current and former properties as well as offsite waste handling or disposal sites that we have used. Liability may be imposed upon us without regard to whether we knew of or caused the presence of such materials and, under certain circumstances, on a joint and several basis. There can be no assurances that the presence of such regulated materials at any such locations, or locations that we may acquire in the future, will not result in liability to us under such laws or regulations or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits based on alleged conduct or environmental conditions.\nOn October 18, 2021, the Biden Administration announced a multi-agency plan to address PFAS contamination. Various federal agencies, including the U.S. EPA, will take actions to prevent the release of PFAS into the air, drinking systems, and food supply and to expand cleanup efforts to remediate the impacts of PFAS pollution. As part of this announcement, the U.S. EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA\u2019s Commitments to Action 2021-2024, which identifies timelines by which the U.S. EPA plans to take specific actions during the first term of the Biden Administration. It is possible that some of these actions may have an impact - direct or indirect - on our business. For example, in August 2022, the U.S. EPA proposed to designate PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, as hazardous substances under CERCLA, which could have wide-ranging impact on companies across various industries. Until further detail is provided, including whether the rule is enacted as proposed, we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the impact of these proposed actions.\nThe adequacy of our current non-FIFRA compliance-related environmental accruals and future provisions depends upon our operating in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations, as well as the assumptions that we have both identified all of the significant sites that must be remediated and that there are no significant conditions of potential contamination that are unknown to us. A significant change in the facts and circumstances underlying these assumptions or in current enforcement policies or requirements, or a finding that we are not in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flows.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses and tax credits) and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly related to our operations in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income of the appropriate character in the relevant jurisdiction.\nFrom time to time, tax proposals are introduced or considered by the U.S. Congress or the legislative bodies in local, state and foreign jurisdictions that could also affect our tax rate, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, or our tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are also affected by the amounts we charge for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items in intercompany transactions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. In connection with these audits (or future audits), tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. As a result, the ultimate resolution of our tax audits, changes in tax laws or tax rates, and the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets could materially affect our tax provision, net income and cash flows in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nWhile we have a general history of increasing the rate of cash dividends on, and engaging in repurchases of, our Common Shares, any future decisions to maintain, reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders or repurchasing our Common Shares could cause the market price for our Common Shares to decline.\nOur payment of quarterly cash dividends on and repurchase of our Common Shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program are subject to, among other things, our financial position and results of operations, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements, credit facility provisions and other factors. Prior to fiscal 2022, we have generally increased the cash dividends on our Common Shares as well as engaged in share repurchase activity. In fiscal 2022, the dividend amount was not\nincreased from the prior year. On February 6, 2020, the Scotts Miracle-Gro Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program allowing for repurchases of up to $750.0 million of Common Shares from April 30, 2020 through March 25, 2023. The total remaining share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2022 was $461.9 million.\nWe may maintain, or increase or decrease (including eliminating) the amount of cash dividends on, and increase or decrease the amount of repurchases of, our Common Shares in the future. Any decision by us regarding the payment of quarterly cash dividends or repurchases of our Common Shares pursuant to our current share repurchase authorization program could cause the market price of our Common Shares to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends on or repurchases of our Common Shares are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends or repurchasing Common Shares at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our Common Shares.\nHagedorn Partnership, L.P. beneficially owns approximately 25% of our Common Shares and can significantly influence decisions that require the approval of shareholders.\nHagedorn Partnership, L.P. beneficially owned approximately 25% of our outstanding Common Shares on a fully diluted basis as of November 18, 2022. As a result, it has sufficient voting power to significantly influence the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders, including entering into certain business combination transactions. In addition, because of the percentage of ownership and voting concentration in Hagedorn Partnership, L.P., elections of our board of directors will generally be within the control of Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. While all of our shareholders are entitled to vote on matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, the concentration of our Common Shares and voting control presently lies with Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. As such, it would be difficult for shareholders to propose and have approved proposals not supported by Hagedorn Partnership, L.P. Hagedorn Partnership, L.P.\u2019s interests could differ from, or conflict with, the interests of other shareholders.", "PERMNO": 77300, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "SMG"}
