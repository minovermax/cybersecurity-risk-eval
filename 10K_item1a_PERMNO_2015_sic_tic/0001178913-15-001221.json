{"cik": "1337675", "company": "Jazz Technologies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter which makes it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur revenues, expenses and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u00b7\nThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the volatility of the markets served by our customers;\n\u00b7\nChanges in the economic conditions of geographical regions where our customers and their markets are located;\n\u00b7\nShifts by integrated device manufacturers and customers between internal and outsourced production;\n\u00b7\nInventory and supply chain management of our customers;\n\u00b7\nThe loss of a key customer, postponement of an order from a key customer or the rescheduling or cancellation of large orders;\n\u00b7\nThe occurrence of accounts receivable write-offs, failure of a key customer to pay accounts receivable in a timely manner or the financial condition of our customers;\n\u00b7\nThe rescheduling or cancellation of planned capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nThe occurrence of an unexpected event, such as environmental events or industrial accidents such as fire or explosions, electricity outage or misprocess, affecting the manufacturing process and our ability to recover the lost or damaged products and provide quality and timely production to our customers with no significant additional costs;\n\u00b7\nCompleting capacity expansion and recruitment of personnel in a timely manner to address product demands by our customers;\n\u00b7\nMergers and acquisitions in the semiconductor industry and its effect on our market share;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to satisfy our customers\u2019 demand for quality and timely production;\n\u00b7\nThe timing and volume of orders relative to our available production capacity;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to obtain raw materials and equipment on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u00b7\nPrice erosion in the industry;\n\u00b7\nOur susceptibility to intellectual property rights disputes;\n\u00b7\nOur dependency on export licenses and other permits required for our operations and the sale of our products;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to maintain existing partners and to enter into new partnerships and technology and supply alliances on mutually beneficial terms;\n\u00b7\nInterest, price index and currency rate fluctuations that were not hedged;\n\u00b7\nTechnological changes and short product life cycles;\n\u00b7\nTiming for the design and the qualification of new products;\n\u00b7\nIncrease in the fair value of our bank loans and debentures; and\n\u00b7\nChanges in accounting rules and new accounting rules affecting our results.\nFurthermore, integrated device manufacturers continue to design and manufacture integrated circuits in their own fabrication facilities. There is a possibility that in certain periods or under certain circumstances such as low demand, they will choose to manufacture their products in their facilities instead of manufacturing products at external foundries. If our customers will choose to manufacture internally rather than manufacture at our facilities, our business may be negatively impacted.\nDue to the factors noted above and other risks discussed in this section, many of which are beyond our control, investors should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons to predict our future performance. Unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our Company, including our operating results, financial condition and ability to maintain our operations.\nA global recession, unfavorable economic conditions and/or a credit crisis may adversely affect our results.\nA downturn or a weakness in the semiconductor industry and/or in the global economy and/or in the Company's customer base and/or customers' products base, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its customers' existing demand for products, attract new customers and new business, increase the utilization rates in its manufacturing facility and maintain it at a high level that would suffice to cover its substantial fixed costs, maintain commercial relationships with its customers, suppliers, and creditors, including its lenders, continue its capacity growth, and improve the Company\u2019s future financial results and position, including its ability to raise funds in the capital markets, and to fulfill its debt obligations and other liabilities, including to refinance its debt and liabilities and/or pay them in a timely manner, comprised mainly of debentures and the bank credit line. There is no assurance that such downturn will not occur. The effects of such a downturn may include global decreased demand, downward price pressure, excess inventory and unutilized capacity worldwide, which may negatively impact consumer and customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and the end products of the Company\u2019s customers.\nIf we are unable to manage fluctuations in cash flow, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nOur working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations, depending on a number of factors. If we are unable to manage fluctuations in cash flow, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Factors which could lead us to suffer cash flow fluctuations include:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the level of revenues from our operating activities;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the collection of receivables;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and size of payables;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and size of capital expenditures; and\n\u00b7\nthe repayment schedules of our debt service obligations under our short-term and long-term liabilities.\nIn addition, we may need to devote a significant portion of our operating cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt. The use of cash to finance our debt could leave us with insufficient funds to adequately finance our operating activities and capital expenditures, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have debt which may have significant negative consequences, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding sources in a timely manner to allow us to re-finance it and/or repay our debt obligations and other liabilities.\nOur debt par value as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $122 million, comprised of approximately $45 million par value of notes originally due June 2015 (the \u201c2010 Notes\u201d) (which were early redeemed in January 2015), $58 million par value of convertible notes due December 2018 (the \u201c2014 Notes\u201d) and $19 million borrowing under the Wells Fargo line of credit which matures in December 2018. Said debt could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nrequiring the use of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our debt rather than investing our cash flows to fund our growth plans, working capital and capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources;\n\u00b7\nenforcement by the lenders under the Wells Fargo line of credit of their liens against our assets in the event of default; and/or\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and other liabilities.\nTo serve our debt and meet our other cash needs, we may need significant amounts of cash, which may not be available to us. We may need to re-finance and/or repay $58 million of 2014 Notes and $19 million borrowed under the Wells Fargo line of credit. Such re-financing and/or repayment amounts may not be available to us in a timely manner or in sufficient amounts to cover our debt and may adversely affect our business and our financial position and may result in higher financing expenses.\nOur ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt and to fund capital expenditures, working capital and other cash needs will depend largely upon our future operating performance, our ability to repay or refinance the notes and our ability to drawdown additional funds, if required, from Wells Fargo. Our future operating performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic conditions, financial market, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under the Wells Fargo line of credit or from other sources in an amount and on terms and conditions sufficient to enable us to make payments on our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. In order to finance our debt and other liabilities and obligations, we continue to explore measures to obtain funds from sources in addition to cash on hand and expected cash flow from our ongoing operations, including sales of assets; issuance of new securities; intellectual property licensing; improving operational efficiencies and sales; and exploring other alternatives to reduce our debt, including debt refinancing or restructuring or recycling of existing debt into new debt or other vehicles.\nA default by us on any of our debt contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the interests of our creditors, and may affect our ability to fulfill our debt obligations and other liabilities.\nThe lack of a significant backlog resulting from our customers not placing purchase orders far in advance makes it difficult for us to forecast our revenues in future periods.\nOur customers generally do not place purchase orders far in advance, partly due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. As a result, we do not typically operate with any significant backlog. The lack of a significant backlog makes it difficult for us to forecast our revenues in future periods. Moreover, since our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenues, we may be unable to adjust costs in a timely manner to compensate for revenue shortfalls. We expect that in the future our revenues in any quarter will continue to be substantially dependent upon purchase orders received in that quarter and in the immediately preceding quarter. We cannot assure you that any of our customers will continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in prior periods. If orders received from our customers differ adversely from our expectations with respect to the product, volume, price or other items, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe occasionally manufacture wafers based on forecasted demand, rather than actual orders from customers. If our forecasted demand exceeds actual demand, we may have obsolete inventory, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe generally do not manufacture wafers unless we receive a customer purchase order. On occasion, we may produce wafers in excess of customer orders based on forecasted customer demand, because we may forecast future excess demand or because of future capacity constraints. If we manufacture more wafers than are actually ordered by customers, we may be left with excess inventory that may ultimately become obsolete and must be scrapped when it cannot be sold. Significant amounts of obsolete inventory could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to operate our facilities at utilization rates that are high enough to maintain revenue levels that would cover our fixed costs, maintain operating profits and allow us to be profitable.\nAs is common in our industry, a large portion of our total costs is comprised of fixed costs, associated mainly with our manufacturing facility, while our variable costs are relatively small. Therefore, during periods when our facility manufactures at high utilization rates, we are able to cover our costs. However, at times when the utilization rate is low, the reduced revenues may not cover all of the costs since a large portion of them are fixed costs and remain constant, irrespective of the fact that fewer wafers were manufactured. In addition, depreciation costs in our industry are high, which has resulted in GAAP operating and/or net loss for certain quarters in the last number of years. If customer demand for our products is not sufficient, or if we are unable to timely address the increased customer demands, we may not be able to operate our facility consistently at high utilization rates, which may not enable us to fully cover all of our costs, achieve and maintain operating profits or achieve net profits. In addition, we may be unable to generate enough cash from operations that would cover our fixed costs, capital expenditures, liabilities and debt payments. We cannot assure that we will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.\nOur sales cycles are typically long and orders received may not meet our expectations, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur sales cycles, which we measure from first contact with a customer to first shipment of a product ordered by the customer, vary substantially and may last as long as two years or more, particularly for new technologies. In addition, even after we make initial shipments of prototype products, it may take several more months to reach full production of the product. As a result of these long sales cycles, we may be required to invest substantial time and incur significant expenses in advance of the receipt of any product order and related revenue. If orders ultimately received differ from our expectations with respect to the product, volume, price or other items, we will have excess capacity that we may not be able to fill within a short period of time, resulting in lower utilization of our facility,which may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to maintain our operations.\nDemand for our foundry services is dependent on the demand in our customers\u2019 end markets. A decrease in demand for, or selling prices of, products that contain semiconductors may decrease the demand for our services and products and reduce our margins.\nOur customers generally use the semiconductors produced in our fab in a wide variety of applications. We derive a significant percentage of our operating revenues from customers who use our manufacturing services to make semiconductors for communication devices, consumer electronics, PCs and other electronic devices. Any significant decrease in the demand for communication devices, consumer electronics, PCs or other electronic devices may decrease the demand for our services and products. In addition, if the average selling prices of communication devices, consumer electronics, PCs or other electronic devices decline significantly, we will be pressured to further reduce our selling prices, which may reduce our revenues and, therefore, may reduce our margins significantly. As demonstrated by downturns in demand for high technology products in the past, market conditions can change rapidly, without apparent warning or advance notice. In such instances, our customers will experience inventory buildup and/or difficulties in selling their products and, in turn, will reduce or cancel orders for wafers from us. The timing, severity and recovery of these downturns cannot be predicted accurately or at all. When they occur, our business and profitability may suffer.\nIn order for demand for our wafer fabrication services to increase, we shall attract new customers or the markets for the end products using these services must develop and expand. Because our services may be used in many new applications, it is difficult to forecast demand. If demand is lower than expected, we may have excess capacity, which may adversely affect our financial results. If demand is higher than expected, we may be unable to fill all of the orders we receive, which may result in the loss of customers and revenue.\nThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and any resulting periodic overcapacity may lead to erosion of sale prices and make our business and operating results particularly vulnerable to economic downturns, and overcapacity in the semiconductor industry may reduce our revenues, earnings and margins.\nThe semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. Traditionally, companies in the semiconductor industry have expanded aggressively during periods of decreased demand in order to have the capacity needed to meet expected demand in future upturns, including through acquiring additional manufacturing facilities. If actual demand does not increase or declines, or if companies in the industry expand too aggressively, the industry may experience a period in which industry-wide capacity exceeds demand. This could result in overcapacity and excess inventories, potentially leading to rapid erosion of average sale prices, as well as to underutilization of manufacturing facilities that as a result may be unable to cover their fixed costs and other liabilities, potentially leading to such facilities to cease their operations. The prices that we can charge our customers for our services are significantly related to the overall worldwide supply of integrated circuits and semiconductor products. The overall supply of semiconductor products is based in part on the capacity of other companies, which is outside of our control. In periods of overcapacity, despite the fact that we utilize niche technologies and manufacture specialty products, we may have to lower the prices we charge our customers for our services which may reduce our margins and weaken our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot give assurance that an increase in the demand for foundry services in the future will not lead to under-capacity, which could result in the loss of customers and materially adversely affect our revenues, earnings and margins. Analysts believe that such patterns may repeat in the future. The overcapacity, under-utilization and downward price pressure characteristic of a downturn in the semiconductor market and/or in the global economy, such as experienced several times in the past, may negatively impact consumer and customer demand for the Company\u2019s products, the end products of the Company\u2019s customers and the financial markets, which may affect our ability to raise funds and/or re-structure and/or re-finance our debt and/or service our other liabilities.\nIf we do not maintain our current customers and attract additional customers, our business may be adversely affected.\nLoss or cancellation of business from, or decreases in the sales volume or sales prices to, our significant customers, or our failure to replace them with other customers, could seriously harm our financial results, revenue and business. Because the sales cycle for our services typically exceeds one year, if our customers order significantly fewer wafers than forecasted or if we lose customers, we will have excess capacity that we may not be able to fill within a short period of time, resulting in lower utilization of our facilities. We may have to reduce prices in order to try to sell more wafers and attract additional customers in order to utilize the excess capacity. In addition to the revenue loss that could result from unused capacity or lower sales prices, we might have difficulty adjusting our costs to reflect the lower revenue in a timely manner, which could harm our financial results.\nWe are substantially dependent upon our relationships with certain customers, and the termination or non-renewal of our agreements or other arrangements with these customers or reduction in the orders received from these customers, may materially and negatively impact our financial position and financial results.\nCollectively, our top four customers accounted for 53% of our revenues in 2014, with one of our customers that accounted for 33% of our revenue in 2014 and from which we expect revenue to be at approximately the same percentage level in 2015. We expect to continue to receive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future. The loss or reduction in volume of any one of these customers, whether due to insolvency, their unwillingness or inability to perform their obligations under their respective relationships with us, or our inability to produce products at their requested quality, cycle time and/or yield, or our inability to renew on commercially reasonable terms any of their respective arrangements with us, or maintain the high level of orders received from these customers, may materially and negatively impact our overall business and our consolidated financial position and financial results.\nIf we do not maintain and develop our technology processes and services, we will lose customers and may be unable to attract new ones.\nThe semiconductor market is characterized by rapid change, including the following:\n\u00b7\nrapid technological developments;\n\u00b7\nevolving industry standards;\n\u00b7\nchanges in customer and product end user requirements;\n\u00b7\nfrequent new product introductions and enhancements; and\n\u00b7\nshort product life cycles with declining prices as products mature.\nOur ability to maintain our current customer base and attract new customers is dependent in part on our ability to continuously develop and introduce to production advanced specialized manufacturing process technologies and purchase the appropriate equipment. If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce these processes to production in a timely manner or at all, or if we are unable to purchase the appropriate equipment required for such processes, we may be unable to maintain our current customer base and may be unable to attract new customers.\nThe semiconductor foundry business is highly competitive; our competitors may have competitive advantages over us.\nThe semiconductor foundry industry is highly competitive. We compete with more than ten independent dedicated foundries, the majority of which are located in Asia-Pacific, including foundries based in Taiwan, China, Korea and Malaysia, and with over 20 integrated semiconductor and end-product manufacturers that allocate a portion of their manufacturing capacity to foundry operations. The foundries with which we compete benefit from their close proximity to other companies involved in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, or ICs.\nAs our competitors continue to increase their manufacturing capacity, there could be an increase in specialty semiconductor capacity during the next several years. As specialty capacity increases there may be more competition and pricing pressure on our services, and underutilization of our capacity may result. Any significant increase in competition or pricing pressure may erode our profit margins, weaken our earnings or increase our losses.\nIn addition, some semiconductor companies have advanced their CMOS designs to 45 nanometer or smaller geometries. These smaller geometries may provide the customer with performance and integration features that may be comparable to, or exceed, features offered by our specialty process technologies, and may be more cost-effective at higher production volumes for certain applications, such as when a large amount of digital content is required in a mixed-signal semiconductor and less analog content is required. Our specialty processes will therefore compete with these processes for customers and some of our potential and existing customers could elect to design these advanced CMOS processes into their next generation products. We are not currently capable, and do not currently plan to become capable, of providing CMOS processes at these smaller geometries. If our potential or existing customers choose to design their products using these advanced CMOS processes, our business may suffer.\nIn addition, many of our competitors may have one or more of the following competitive advantages over us:\n\u00b7\ngreater manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7\nmultiple and more advanced manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7\nmore advanced technological capabilities;\n\u00b7\na more diverse and established customer base;\n\u00b7\ngreater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources;\n\u00b7\na better cost structure; and/or\n\u00b7\nbetter operational performance in cycle time and yields.\nIf we do not compete effectively, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we experience difficulty in achieving acceptable device yields, good quality, high product yields, good product performance and delivery times as a result of manufacturing problems, our business and financial position could be seriously harmed.\nThe process technology for the manufacture of semiconductor wafers is highly complex, requires advanced and costly equipment and is constantly being modified in an effort to improve device yields, product performance and delivery times. Microscopic impurities such as dust and other contaminants, difficulties in the production process, defects in the key materials and tools used to manufacture a wafer and other factors can cause wafers to be rejected or individual semiconductors on specific wafers to be non-functional, as well as bottle necks caused in production line due to high demand to certain process flows or machines. We may experience difficulty achieving acceptable device yields, product performance and product delivery times in the future as a result of manufacturing problems. Any of these problems could seriously harm our operating results, financial condition and ability to maintain our operations.\nAlthough we have been enhancing our manufacturing capabilities and efficiency, from time to time we have experienced production difficulties that have caused delivery delays and quality control problems, as is common in the semiconductor industry. In the past, we have encountered the following problems:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in upgrading or expanding existing facilities;\n\u00b7\nunexpected breakdowns in our manufacturing equipment and/or related facility systems;\n\u00b7\nunexpected events, such as an electricity outage or misprocess, affecting the manufacturing process;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in changing or upgrading our process technologies;\n\u00b7\nraw materials shortages and impurities; and\n\u00b7\ndelays in delivery and shortages of spare parts and in maintenance of our equipment.\nIf we are unable to purchase equipment and raw materials, we may not be able to manufacture our products in a timely fashion, which may result in a loss of existing and potential new customers.\nTo increase the production capability of our facility and to maintain the quality of production in our facility, we must procure additional equipment. In periods of high market demand, the lead times from order to delivery of manufacturing equipment could be as long as 12 to 18 months. We also procure used equipment which can take longer to qualify into the manufacturing process, hence we may not be able to manufacture our products in a timely manner. In addition, our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, chemicals, gases and various metals, and require large amounts of fresh water and electricity. Manufacturing equipment and raw materials generally are available from several suppliers. In several instances, however, we purchase equipment and raw materials from a single source. Shortages in supplies of manufacturing equipment and raw materials could occur due to an interruption of supply or increased industry demand. Any such shortages could result in production delays that could result in a loss of existing and potential new customers. This may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe depend on intellectual property rights of third parties and failure to maintain or acquire licenses could harm our business.\nWe depend on third party intellectual property in order for us to provide certain foundry and design services to our clients. If problems or delays arise with respect to the timely development, quality and provision of such intellectual property to us, the design and production of our customers\u2019 products could be delayed, resulting in underutilization of our capacity. If any of our third party intellectual property vendors goes out of business, liquidates, merges with, or is acquired by, another company that discontinues the vendor\u2019s previous line of business, or if we fail to maintain or acquire licenses to such intellectual property for any other reason, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, license fees and royalties payable under these agreements may impact our margins and operating results.\nFailure to comply with the intellectual property rights of third parties or to defend our intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and defending our intellectual property rights. Because of the complexity of the technologies used and the multitude of patents, copyrights and other overlapping intellectual property rights, it is often difficult for semiconductor companies to determine infringement. Therefore, the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to intellectual property claims from time to time, some of which have been resolved through license agreements, the terms of which have not had a material effect on our business.\nBecause of the nature of the industry, we may continue to be a party to infringement claims in the future. In the event any third party were to assert infringement claims against us or our customers, we may have to consider alternatives including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nnegotiating cross-license agreements;\n\u00b7\nseeking to acquire licenses to the allegedly infringed patents, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\ndiscontinuing use of certain process technologies, architectures, or designs, which could cause us to stop manufacturing certain integrated circuits if we were unable to design around the allegedly infringed patents;\n\u00b7\nfighting the matter in court and paying substantial monetary damages in the event we lose; or\n\u00b7\nseeking to develop non-infringing technologies, which may not be feasible.\nAny one or several of these alternatives could place substantial financial and administrative burdens on us and hinder our business. Litigation, which could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our resources, may also be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us or our customers against claimed infringement of the rights of others. If we fail to obtain certain licenses or if litigation relating to alleged patent infringement or other intellectual property matters occurs, it could prevent us from manufacturing particular products or applying particular technologies, which could reduce our opportunities to generate revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 165 patents in force. We intend to continue to file patent applications when appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection may take a long time and be expensive. We cannot assure you that patents will be issued from pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, they will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. In addition, we cannot assure you that other countries in which we market our services and products will protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. Further, we cannot assure you that we will at all times enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or that courts will uphold our intellectual property rights, or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to protect our proprietary technology, which could reduce our opportunities to generate revenues.\nEffective intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. It may be difficult for us to protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other companies in these countries. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business and results of operations.\nWe could be seriously harmed by failure to comply with environmental regulations.\nOur business is subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the use, discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous materials used in our production processes. If we fail to use, discharge or dispose of hazardous materials appropriately, or if applicable environmental laws or regulations change in the future, we could be subject to substantial liability or could be required to suspend or adversely modify our manufacturing operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss due to fire because the materials we use in our manufacturing processes are highly flammable.\nWe use highly flammable materials such as silane and hydrogen in our manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to the risk of loss arising from fires. The risk of fire associated with these materials cannot be completely eliminated. Although we maintain insurance policies to reduce potential losses that may be caused by fire, including business interruption insurance, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses due to a fire. If our fab were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of a fire, and if our insurance proves to be inadequate, it may reduce our manufacturing capacity and revenues. In addition, a power outage, even of very limited duration, caused by a fire may result in a loss of wafers in production, deterioration in our fab yield and substantial downtime to reset equipment before resuming production.\nPossible product returns could harm our business.\nProducts manufactured by us may be returned within specified periods if they are defective or otherwise fail to meet customers\u2019 prior agreed upon specifications. Although product returns have historically been less than 1% of revenues, future product returns which exceed our established provisions by significant amounts, if any, may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to our international operations.\nWe have made substantial revenue from customers located in Asia-Pacific and in Europe. Because of our international operations, we are vulnerable to the following risks:\n\u00b7\nwe price our products primarily in US dollars; if the Euro, Yen or other currencies weaken relative to the US dollar, our products may be relatively more expensive in these regions which may affect our ability to be competitive compare to the local manufactures in these regions and could result in a decrease in our revenue;\n\u00b7\nthe burdens and costs of compliance with foreign government regulation, as well as compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u00b7\ngeneral geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability, international terrorism, potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business;\n\u00b7\nimposition of regulatory requirements, tariffs, import and export restrictions and other trade barriers and restrictions including the timing and availability of export licenses and permits;\n\u00b7\nadverse tax rules and regulations;\n\u00b7\nweak protection of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\ndelays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions;\n\u00b7\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations.\nIn addition, the United States and foreign countries may implement quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products, leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country. The geographical distance between the United States, Asia and Europe also creates a number of logistical and communication challenges. We cannot assure you that we will not experience any serious harm in connection with our international operations.\nOur business could suffer if we are unable to retain and recruit qualified personnel.\nWe depend on the continued services of our executive officers, senior managers and skilled technical and other personnel. Our business could suffer if we lose the services of some of these personnel because we may not be able to find and adequately integrate replacement personnel into our operations in a timely manner. We seek to recruit highly qualified personnel and there is intense competition for the services of these personnel in the semiconductor industry. Competition for personnel may increase significantly in the future as new fabless semiconductor companies as well as new semiconductor manufacturing facilities are established. Our ability to retain existing personnel and attract new personnel is in part dependent on the compensation packages we offer. As demand for qualified personnel increases, we may be forced to increase the compensation levels and to adjust the cash, equity and other components of compensation we offer our personnel.\nOur business plan is premised on the increasing use of outsourced foundry services by both fabless semiconductor companies and integrated device manufacturers for the production of semiconductors using specialty process technologies. Our business may not be successful if this trend does not continue to develop in the manner we expect.\nWe operate as an independent semiconductor foundry focused primarily on specialty process technologies. Our business model assumes that demand for these processes within the semiconductor industry will grow and will follow the broader trend towards outsourcing foundry operations. Although the use of foundries is established and growing for standard CMOS processes, the use of outsourced foundry services for specialty process technologies is less common and may never develop into a significant part of the semiconductor industry. If fabless companies and vertically integrated device manufacturers choose not to access independent specialty foundry capacity, the manufacture of specialty process technologies may not follow the trend of standard CMOS processes. If the broader trend to outsourced foundry services does not prove applicable to the specialty process technologies that we are focused on, our business, results of operations and cash flow may be harmed.\nIf we are not able to continue transitioning our product mix from standard CMOS process technologies to specialty process technologies, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nSince Jazz Semiconductor\u2019s separation from Conexant, it has focused its research and development and marketing efforts primarily on specialty process technologies and adding new customers in the specialty field. These specialty process technologies include advanced analog, radio frequency, high voltage, bipolar and silicon germanium bipolar CMOS processes and double-diffused metal oxide semiconductor processes. To be competitive, reduce our dependence on standard process technologies and successfully implement our business plan, we will need to continue to derive a significant percentage of our revenues from specialty process technologies. In order to expand and diversify our customer base, we need to identify and attract customers who will use the specialty process technologies we provide. We cannot assure you that demand for our specialty process technologies will increase or that we will be able to attract customers who use them.\nIn addition, because we intend to continue to focus on specialty process technologies, we do not plan to invest in the research and development of more advanced standard CMOS processes. As standard CMOS process technologies continue to advance, we will not remain competitive in these process technologies. If Jazz\u2019s current customers switch to another foundry for standard CMOS process technologies and we are unable to increase our revenues from our specialty process technologies, Jazz\u2019s business, results of operations and cash flows may be harmed.\nOur historical financial performance may not be indicative of our future results.\nSince Jazz Semiconductor\u2019s inception, a large percentage of its revenues has primarily been derived from products manufactured using standard CMOS processes that are no longer the focus of its business. As customers design their next generation products for smaller geometry CMOS processes, they may look to other foundries to provide their requisite manufacturing capacity. As a result, we may not continue to generate the same level of revenues from our standard CMOS processes in the future as it shifts our focus and operations to our more specialized processes: advanced analog, radio frequency, high voltage, bipolar and silicon germanium bipolar CMOS processes and double-diffused metal oxide semiconductor processes. If our potential or existing customers design their products using smaller geometry CMOS processes at other foundries, and we are unable to increase the revenues we derive from our specialty process technologies, our business, results of operations and cash flows may be harmed.\nOur manufacturing suppliers or our customers could reduce our sales or require design modifications due to noncompliance with existing or future governmental regulations.\nThe semiconductors we produce and the export of technologies used in our manufacturing processes may be subject to U.S. export control and other regulations implemented by the U.S. and/or other countries. Failure to comply with existing or evolving U.S. or foreign governmental regulation or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates could materially harm our business by reducing our sales, or requiring extensive modifications to our customers\u2019 products. Neither we nor our customers may export products using or incorporating controlled technology without obtaining an export license. These restrictions may make foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their processes and their customers\u2019 products more competitive in the global market than us or our customers. The U.S. government may not approve any pending or future export license requests. In addition, the list of products and countries for which export approval is required, and the regulatory policies with respect thereto, could be revised from time to time.\nA significant portion of our workforce is unionized, and our operations may be adversely affected by work stoppages, strikes or other collective actions which may disrupt our production and adversely affect the yield and deliveries of our fab.\nA significant portion of our employees at our Newport Beach, California fab are represented by a union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement that is scheduled to expire in May 2015 and is currently being negotiated for renewal We cannot predict the effect that continued union representation or future organizational activities will have on our business. We cannot assure you that we will not experience a material work stoppage, strike or other collective action in the future, which may disrupt our production and adversely affect our yield and deliveries of our fab, resulting in negative impacts to our customers, financial position and financial results.\nIf we are unable to collaborate successfully with electronic design automation vendors and third-party design service companies to meet our customers\u2019 design needs, our business could be harmed.\nWe have established relationships with electronic design automation vendors and third-party design service companies. We work together with these vendors to develop complete design kits that our customers can use to meet their design needs using our process technologies. Our ability to meet our customers\u2019 design needs successfully depends on the availability and quality of the relevant services, tools and technologies provided by electronic design automation vendors and design service providers, and on whether Jazz, together with these providers, is able to meet customers\u2019 schedule and budget requirements. Difficulties or delays in these areas may adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs, and thereby harm our business.\nIf the semiconductor wafers we manufacture are used in defective products, we may be subject to product liability or other claims and our reputation could be harmed.\nWe provide custom manufacturing to our customers who use the semiconductor wafers we manufacture as components in their products sold to end users. If these products are used in defective or malfunctioning products, we could be sued for damages, especially if the defect or malfunction causes physical harm to people. The occurrence of a problem could result in product liability claims as well as a recall of, or safety alert or advisory notice relating to, the product. We cannot assure you that our insurance policies will cover specific product liability issues or that they will be adequate to satisfy claims made against Jazz in the future. Also, we may be unable to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates, in adequate amounts, or at all. Product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and on our ability to attract and retain customers.\nOur production yields and business could be significantly harmed by natural disasters, particularly earthquakes.\nOur Newport Beach, California fab is located in southern California, a region known for seismic activity. Due to the complex and delicate nature of our manufacturing processes, our facilities are particularly sensitive to the effects of vibrations associated with even minor earthquakes. Our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities, computer systems and personnel. We cannot be certain that precautions we have taken to seismically upgrade our fab will be adequate to protect our facilities in the event of a major earthquake, and any resulting damage could seriously disrupt our production and result in reduced revenues. In addition, we have no insurance coverage which may compensate us for losses that may be incurred as a result of earthquakes, and any such losses or damages incurred by us may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nClimate change may negatively affect our business.\nThere is increasing concern that climate change is occurring and may have dramatic effects on human activity without aggressive remediation steps. Public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs.\nScientific examination of, political attention to and rules and regulations on issues surrounding the existence and extent of climate change may result in increased production costs due to increase in the prices of energy and introduction of energy or carbon tax. A variety of regulatory developments have been introduced that focus on restricting or managing emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Enterprises may need to purchase new equipment at higher costs or raw materials with lower carbon footprints. These developments and further legislation that is likely to be enacted may adversely affect our operations. Changes in environmental regulations, such as those on the use of per fluorinated compounds, may increase our production costs, which may adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn addition, more frequent droughts and floods, extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels may occur due to climate change. For example, transportation suspension caused by extreme weather conditions may harm the distribution of our products. We cannot predict the economic impact, if any, of disasters or climate change.\nCompliance with the US Conflict Minerals Law may affect our ability or the ability of our suppliers to purchase raw materials at an effective cost.\nMany industries rely on materials which are subject to regulation concerning certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\"DRC\") or adjoining countries, which include Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, Angola, Congo, and Central African Republic. These minerals are commonly referred to as conflict minerals. Conflict minerals which may be used in our industry or by our suppliers include Columbite-tantalite (derivative of tantalum [Ta]), Cassiterite (derivative of tin [Sn]), gold [Au], Wolframite (derivative of tungsten [W]), and Cobalt [Co]. The SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements beginning in May 2014 with respect to use of conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Although we expect that we and our vendors will be able to comply with the requirements, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to gather all the information required from our vendors. In addition, there is increasing public sentiment that companies should avoid using conflict materials from the DRC and adjoining countries. Although we believe our suppliers do not rely on such conflict materials, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies of materials needed in our production from supply chains outside the DRC and adjoining countries. A failure to obtain necessary information or to maintain adequate supplies of materials from supply chains outside the DRC and adjoining countries may delay our production, increasing the risk of losing customers and business.\nOur production may be interrupted if it cannot maintain sufficient sources of fresh water and electricity.\nThe semiconductor manufacturing process requires extensive amounts of fresh water and a stable source of electricity. Droughts, pipeline interruptions, power interruptions, electricity shortages or government intervention, particularly in the form of rationing, are factors that could restrict our access to these utilities in the area in which our fab is located. In particular, our Newport Beach, California fab is located in an area that is susceptible to water and electricity shortages. If there is an insufficient supply of fresh water or electricity to satisfy our requirements, we may need to limit or delay our production, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Increases in utility costs would also increase our operating expenses. In addition, a power outage, even of very limited duration, could result in a loss of wafers in production, deterioration in our fab yield and substantial downtime to reset equipment before resuming production.\nRisks relating to construction activities and our fabrication facility lease.\nWe lease our fabrication facilities and headquarters under lease contracts that we can extend until 2027, through the exercise of options at our sole discretion to extend the lease periods from 2017 to 2022 and from 2022 to 2027. A few years ago our landlord began a construction project adjacent to the fabrication facility. Although we do not anticipate material adverse impact to our operations, it is possible that construction activities adjacent to our fabrication facility could result in temporary reductions or interruptions in the supply of utilities to the property and that a portion or all of the fabrication facility may need to be idled temporarily during development. If construction activities limit or interrupt the supply of water, gas or electricity to our fabrication facility or cause significant vibrations or other disruptions, it could limit or delay our production, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, an unplanned power outage caused by construction activities, even of very limited duration, could result in a loss of wafers in production, deterioration in our fab yield and substantial downtime to reset equipment before resuming production. In addition, the recent lease amendment set forth certain obligations of the Company and the landlord, including certain noise abatement actions at the fabrication facility.", "PERMNO": 91190, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "TSEM1"}
