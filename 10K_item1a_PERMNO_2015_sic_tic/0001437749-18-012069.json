{"cik": "719274", "company": "GIGA TRONICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-06-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur recent losses, limited liquidity and limited capital resources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern\nWe incurred net losses of $3.1 million in fiscal 2018, and $1.5 million in fiscal 2017. These losses have contributed to an accumulated deficit of $28.7 million as of March 31, 2018.\nBeginning in fiscal 2012, we invested primarily in the development of our Advanced Signal Generation and Analysis system product platform for EW test & emulation applications (formerly referred to as \u201cHydra\u201d) which the Company believes possesses greater long-term opportunities for revenue growth and improved gross margins compared to our previous general-purpose test & measurement product lines, the substantial majority of which have been sold as of March 31, 2018. Through March 31, 2018, the Company has spent over $13 million towards the development of the ASGA system product platform. Although we anticipate long-term revenue growth and improved gross margins from the new ASGA product platform, delays in completing it have also contributed to our losses. We have also experienced delays in the development of features, receipt of orders, and shipments for the new ASGA system products. These delays have significantly contributed to a decrease in working capital from $620,000 at March 25, 2017 to ($386,000) at March 31, 2018. Although ASGA system products have now shipped to several customers, potential delays in the refinement of further features, longer than anticipated sales cycles, or the ability to generate shipments in significant quantities, could significantly contribute to additional future losses.\nThese matters raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nTo address these matters, our management has taken several actions to provide additional liquidity and reduce costs and expenses going forward. These actions are described in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Part II-Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, Going Concern and Management\u2019s Plan.\nWe face risks related to production delays, delays of customer orders and higher selling price of a new product platform\nWe invested heavily in the development of our new ASGA product platform, however, delays in completing its development, together with early design and manufacturing issues and longer than anticipated sales cycles have contributed to our losses and increased accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2018. Additionally, the average selling price of our new ASGA products is considerably higher that our prior general-purpose test & measurement products, which in turn, requires additional internal approvals on the part of the purchaser and generally leads to longer sales cycles. Our financial condition may also cause potential customers to delay, postpone or decide against placing orders for our products. Continued longer than anticipated sales cycles in future fiscal years, or delays in production and shipping volume quantities, could significantly contribute to additional losses.\nTrading of our common stock has moved from the NASDAQ Capital Market to the OTCQB Market\nOn May 4, 2017, we received a notification letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) advising the Company that it has initiated proceedings to delist the Company from NASDAQ for the Company\u2019s failure to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s bid price rule. As previously reported on November 1, 2016, NASDAQ notified the Company that the bid price of its listed security had closed at less than $1 per share over the previous 30 consecutive business days, and, thus, did not comply with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cRule\u201d).\nOn October 30, 2017, the Company\u2019s common stock began trading on the OTCQB Market. The Company\u2019s ticker symbol (GIGA) remained the same. As a result of this change, there may be reduced liquidity for our common stock and it could be more difficult for investors to purchase or sell shares of our common stock.\nGiga-tronics Inc. remains a public company following the delisting and our shares will continues to trade publicly. We will continue to make SEC filings on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and we will remain subject to the SEC rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies under the Exchange Act. We will maintain an independent Board of Directors with an independent Audit Committee and provide annual financial statements audited by an independent auditor and unaudited interim financial reports reviewed by our independent auditors, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nOur sales are substantially dependent on the defense industry and a limited number of customers\nAll of our current product and service offerings are directed towards the defense marketplace which has a limited number of customers. If the defense market demand decreases, actual shipments could be less than projected shipments with a resulting decline in sales. Additionally, the loss of any one customer may have a material adverse effect on future operating results and financial condition. Our product backlog also has a number of risks and uncertainties such as the cancellation or deferral of orders, dispute over performance of our products and our ability to collect amounts due under these orders. If any of these events occur, actual shipments could be lower than projected shipments and revenues could decline which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nOur markets involve rapidly changing technology and standards\nThe market for electronics equipment is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop and commercialize our existing products, and in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new products and product lines with improved capabilities, and to continue to enhance existing products. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete the development of current or future products, or that such products will achieve market acceptance. The inability to develop new products in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on our operating performance and liquidity.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, making it difficult to predict future performance\nOur revenue, expenses and operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors. Factors that may contribute to these fluctuations include our dependence on the defense industry and a limited number of customers, the nature and length of our sales cycles for our products and services, the duration and delivery schedules within our customer contracts, our ability to timely develop and produce our products, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOur common stock price is volatile\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, receipt or cancellation of significant orders, reduction in revenues or lower earnings or increased losses and reduced levels of liquidity when compared to previous quarterly periods, and other factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or by our competitors, government regulations or developments in patent or other proprietary rights. In addition, the OTCQB Market and other stock markets have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. Some of these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the reported operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general foreign and domestic economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock at any time has historically traded on low volume on the NASDAQ Capital Market and OTCQB Market. Sales of a significant volume of stock could result in a decline of our share price.\nPerformance problems in our products or problems arising from the use of our products together with other vendors\u2019 products may harm our business and reputation\nProducts as complex as those we produce may contain unknown and undetected defects or performance problems. For example, it is possible that a product might not comply with stipulated specifications under all circumstances. In addition, our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a combined equipment environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. A defect or performance problem could result in lost revenues, increased warranty costs, diversion of engineering and management time and effort, impaired customer relationships and injury to our reputation generally. To date, performance problems in our products or in other products used together with our products have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, management cannot be certain that a material adverse impact will not occur in the future.\nOur competition has greater resources\nSeveral of our competitors including, among others, Agilent/Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments have substantially greater research and development, manufacturing, marketing, financial, and technological personnel and managerial resources than us. These resources also make these competitors better able to withstand difficult market conditions than us. There can be no assurance that any products developed by the competitors will not gain greater market acceptance than any developed by us.\nWe may incur substantial costs enforcing our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings\nIn connection with the potential enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or disputes related to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention and energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Additionally, we may not prevail in any future litigation and disputes, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not generate net cash flow from our operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital, our financial condition would be adversely affected and we may not to be able to execute our growth strategy and we could become insolvent\nWe cannot assure that we will generate cash from operations or other potential sources to fund our future working capital needs. The lack of additional working capital from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to discontinue or suspend unprofitable product lines, business segments or otherwise substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot assure that any necessary funds, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. If our financial condition were to worsen and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy, and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy.\nOur Advanced Signal Generation and Analysis system product platform is complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may increase our costs, harm our reputation with customers, give rise to costly litigation, or divert our resources from other purposes.\nOur new ASGA system products are extremely complex. Despite testing, our initial products contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors, or performance problems following its sale or when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, diversion of our personnel\u2019s attention from our product development efforts, exposure to liability for damages, damaged customer relationships, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, increased development and warranty costs could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins.\nWe are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. Staffing due to the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups can be expensive, divert our attention from executing our business plan and could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the area surrounding our facility could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs.\nBusiness interruptions could delay or prevent our business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur facility is located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable other natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations, such as cybersecurity breaches, that may be beyond our control. We do not carry insurance for earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows, and success as an overall business.", "PERMNO": 39029, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "GIGA"}
