{"cik": "78128", "company": "AQUA AMERICA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially harmed.\n\ufeff\nContamination of our water supply, including water provided to our customers, may result in disruption in our services, additional costs and litigation which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur water supplies, including water provided to our customers, are subject to possible contamination, including from:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nnaturally occurring compounds or man-made substances;\n\u00b7\nchemicals and other hazardous materials;\n\u00b7\nlead and other materials;\n\u00b7\npharmaceuticals and personal care products; and\n\u00b7\npossible deliberate or terrorist attacks.\n\ufeff\nDepending on the nature of the water contamination, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute, where feasible, the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source, including if practicable, the purchase of water from other suppliers, or continue the water supply under restrictions on use for drinking or broader restrictions against all use except for basic sanitation and essential fire protection. We may incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, costs for water quality testing and monitoring, treatment of the contaminated source through modification of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods, or the purchase of alternative water supplies. In addition, the costs we could incur to decontaminate a water source or our water distribution system and dispose of waste could also be significant. The costs resulting from the contamination may not be recoverable in rates we charge our customer, or may not be recoverable in a timely manner. If we are unable to adequately treat the contaminated water supply or substitute a water supply from an uncontaminated water source in a timely or cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We could also be subject to:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nclaims for consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination and/or hazardous substances in our water supplies, including toxic torts;\n\u00b7\nclaims for other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nclaims for customers\u2019 business interruption as a result of an interruption in water service;\n\u00b7\nclaims for breach of contract;\n\u00b7\ncriminal enforcement actions; or\n\u00b7\nother claims.\n\ufeff\nThe events in Flint, Michigan, which commenced in 2014, and other communities have brought attention to the issue of lead in drinking water from home plumbing. Lead in drinking water can come from lead that leaches from service lines, home plumbing solder, and fixtures or faucets. We have been working to prevent lead leaching from home plumbing sources by reducing water corrosivity and adding chemicals that can prevent leaching of lead in pipes and homes. We also focus on identifying and removing lead service lines and encouraging customers to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line if it is lead as they are identified during our main replacement program or during other maintenance activities. We support the recommendations of The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, a collaborative of leading water industry organizations that has recommended full replacement of lead service lines as a \u201cbest practice\u201d to reduce lead in drinking water, but we only have control over the company-owned portion of each service line. In cases where we are replacing a company-owned lead service line, our standard approach is to replace the company-owned portion and advise and encourage the customer to replace the customer-owned portion of the service line, all the way to the customer\u2019s home. We also advise customers of the potential health impacts of lead in drinking water, and conduct lead testing at homes following replacement of a lead service line. We do not plan on replacing customer-owned lead service lines at locations where our portion of the service line does not contain lead, but if we become aware of such situations we will notify the customer. We anticipate that the EPA will propose updated regulations for the 1992 Lead and Copper Rule in 2018. Any such regulatory changes could have an impact on our business.\n\ufeff\nWe may incur costs to defend our position and/or incur reputational damage even if we are not liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination and/or hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims, and losses incurred may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. Such claims or actions could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe rates we charge our customers are subject to regulation. If we are unable to obtain government approval of our requests for rate increases or if approved rate increases are untimely or inadequate to recover and earn a return on our capital investments, to recover expenses or taxes, or to take into account changes in water usage, our profitability may suffer.\n\ufeff\nThe rates we charge our customers are subject to approval by utility commissions in the states in which we operate. We file rate increase requests, from time to time, to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses. Our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the recovery of, and return on, our capital investments and expenses through the rates we charge our customers. Once a rate increase petition is filed with a utility commission, the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly, and our costs may not always be fully recoverable. The timing of our rate increase requests are therefore partially dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase. In addition, the amount or frequency of rate increases may be decreased or lengthened as a result of many factors including changes in regulatory oversight in the states in which we operate water and wastewater utilities and income tax laws, including regulations regarding tax-basis depreciation as it applies to our capital expenditures or qualifying utility asset improvements. We can provide no assurances that any future rate increase request will be approved by the appropriate utility commission; and, if approved, we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner.\n\ufeff\nIn Virginia, we may seek authorization to bill our utility customers in accordance with a rate filing that is pending before the respective regulatory commission. Furthermore, some utility commissions authorize the use of expense deferrals and amortization in order to provide for an impact on our operating income by an amount that approximates the requested\namount in a rate request. The additional revenue billed and collected prior to the final ruling is subject to refund to customers based on the outcome of the ruling. The revenue recognized and the expenses deferred by us reflect an estimate as to the final outcome of the ruling. If the request is denied completely or in part, we could be required to refund to customers some or all of the revenue billed to date, and write-off some or all of the deferred expenses.\n\ufeff\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures that are partially dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. Disruptions in the capital markets may limit our access to capital. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, or if the cost of borrowing increases, it may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to pay dividends.\n\ufeff\nOur business is capital intensive. In addition to the capital required to fund customer growth through our acquisition strategy, on an annual basis, we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property, plant and equipment. We obtain funds for our capital expenditures from operations, contributions and advances by developers and others, debt issuances, and equity issuances. We have paid dividends consecutively for 73 years and our Board of Directors recognizes the value that our common shareholders place on both our historical payment record and on our future dividend payments. Our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the availability of adequate capital, and we may not be able to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all. If in the future, our credit facilities are not renewed or our short-term borrowings are called for repayment, we would need to seek alternative financing sources; however, there can be no assurance that these alternative financing sources would be available on terms acceptable to us. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we may need to take steps to conserve cash by reducing our capital expenditures or dividend payments and our ability to pursue acquisitions may be limited. The reduction in capital expenditures may result in reduced potential earnings growth, affect our ability to meet environmental laws and regulations, and limit our ability to improve or expand our utility systems to the level we believe appropriate. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital in the future on reasonable terms and conditions for expansion, construction and maintenance. In addition, delays in completing major capital projects could delay the recovery of the capital expenditures associated with such projects through rates. If the cost of borrowing increases, we might not be able to recover increases in our cost of capital through rates. The inability to recover higher borrowing costs through rates, or the regulatory lag associated with the time that it takes to begin recovery, may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations.\n\ufeff\nWe are obligated to comply with debt covenants under some of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date, limit future borrowings, cause us to default on other obligations, and increase borrowing costs. If we are forced to repay or refinance (on less favorable terms) these borrowings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed by reduced access to capital and increased costs and rates.\n\ufeff\nOne of the important elements of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater utility systems. Any future acquisitions we decide to undertake may involve risks. Further, competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities, and strategic and financial buyers may hinder our ability to grow our business.\n\ufeff\nOne important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water and wastewater utility systems in order to broaden our service areas. We will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. It is our intent, when practical, to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations. The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management's time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ndilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\u00b7\nincurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, and environmental liabilities;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nfailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nrecording goodwill and other intangible assets for which we may never realize their full value and may result in an asset impairment that may negatively affect our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in quarterly results;\n\u00b7\nother acquisition related expenses; and\n\u00b7\nexposure to unknown or unexpected risks and liabilities.\n\ufeff\nSome or all of these items could harm our business and our ability to finance our business and to comply with regulatory requirements. The businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment, and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process, including in the integration of processes necessary for internal control and financial reporting, could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and harm our internal controls.\n\ufeff\nSome states in which we operate allow the respective public utility commissions to use fair market value to set ratemaking rate base instead of the traditional depreciated original cost of water or wastewater assets for certain qualifying municipal acquisitions. Depending on the state, there are varying rules and circumstances in which fair value is determined. One state\u2019s regulations allows ratemaking rate base to equal the lower of the average of the appraisals or the purchase price, and is subject to regulatory approval. There may be situations where we may pay more than the ultimate fair value of the utility assets as set by the regulatory commission, despite the fair value legislation suggesting its full recovery. In these situations, goodwill may be recognized to the extent there is an excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired through acquisition. Our financial condition and results of operations can be harmed by an inability to earn a return on, and recover our purchase price as a component of rate base.\n\ufeff\nWe compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers, for acquisition opportunities. As consolidation becomes more prevalent in the utility industry and competition for acquisitions increases, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. In addition, our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing utilities near our existing operations, thereby preventing us from acquiring them. Governmental entities or environmental / social activist groups have challenged, and may in the future challenge our efforts to acquire new service territories, particularly from municipalities or municipal authorities. Higher purchase prices and resulting rates may limit our ability to invest additional capital for system maintenance and upgrades in an optimal manner. Our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new companies and/or service territories with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations or capital, or that submit more attractive bids. Any of these risks may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur facilities could be the target of a possible terrorist or other deliberate attack which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the potential contamination of our water supply as described in a separate risk factor herein, we maintain security measures at our facilities and have heightened employee and public safety official awareness of potential threats to our water systems. We have and will continue to bear increases in costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations, and supplies, most of which have been recoverable under state regulatory policies. While the costs of increases in security, including capital expenditures, may be significant, we expect these costs to continue to be recoverable in water and wastewater rates. Despite our security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events, or other attacks on our water systems, should they occur. Such an event could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle any of our dams or reservoirs may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nSeveral of our water systems include impounding dams and reservoirs of various sizes. Although we believe our dam review program, which includes regular inspections and other engineering studies, will ensure our dams are structurally sound and well-maintained, the failure of a dam could result in significant downstream damage and could result in claims for property damage or for injuries or fatalities. We periodically inspect our dams and purchase liability insurance to\ncover such risks, but depending on the nature of the downstream damage and cause of the failure, the policy limits of insurance coverage may not be sufficient, and losses incurred may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates. A dam failure could also result in damage to, or disruption of, our water treatment and pumping facilities that are often located downstream from our dams and reservoirs. Significant damage to these facilities, or a significant decline in the storage of the raw water impoundment, could affect our ability to provide water to our customers until the facilities and a sufficient raw water impoundment can be restored. The estimated costs to maintain our dams are included in our capital budget projections and, although such costs to date have been recoverable in rates, there can be no assurance that rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to recover such costs in the future, if at all.\n\ufeff\nAny failure of our water and wastewater treatment plants, network of water and wastewater pipes, or water reservoirs could result in damages that may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur operating subsidiaries treat water and wastewater, distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes, and store water in reservoirs. A failure of a major treatment plant, pipe, or reservoir could result in claims for injuries or property damage. The failure of a major treatment plant, pipe, or reservoir may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quality and quantities to our customers or collect and treat wastewater in accordance with standards prescribed by governmental regulators, including state utility commissions, and may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\n\ufeff\nWe are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems, resulting from cyber security attacks or other cyber-related events, could harm our business.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business, especially with respect to customer service and billing, accounting and, in some cases, the monitoring and operation of our treatment, storage and pumping facilities. In addition, we rely on our systems to track our utility assets and to manage maintenance and construction projects, materials and supplies, and our human resource functions. A loss of these systems, or major problems with the operation of these systems, could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from the following types of cyber security attacks or other cyber-related events:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\npower loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;\n\u00b7\noperator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;\n\u00b7\nphysical and electronic loss of data;\n\u00b7\ncomputer viruses, cyber security attacks, intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of service actions, misappropriation of data and similar events;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the implementation of upgrades or modification to our information technology systems; and\n\u00b7\nhurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters.\n\ufeff\nAlthough we do not believe that our systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security attacks than other similar organizations, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from the types of cyber security attacks or other events listed above or other similar actions, and such incidents may go undetected for a period of time. Such cyber security attacks or other events may result in:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe loss or compromise of customer, financial, employee, or operational data;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of billing, collections or normal field service activities;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of electronic monitoring and control of operational systems; and\n\u00b7\ndelays in financial reporting and other normal management functions.\n\ufeff\nPossible impacts associated with a cyber security attack or other events may include: remediation costs related to lost, stolen, or compromised data; repairs to data processing systems; increased cyber security protection costs; adverse effects\non our compliance with regulatory and environmental laws and regulation, including standards for drinking water; litigation; and reputational damage. We maintain insurance to help defray costs associated with cyber security attacks or other events, but we cannot provide assurance that such insurance will provide coverage for any particular type of incident or event or that such insurance will be adequate, and losses incurred may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\n\ufeff\nOur business is impacted by weather conditions and is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could harm demand for our water service and our revenues and earnings.\n\ufeff\nDemand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems, and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, if there is more rainfall than normal, or rainfall is more frequent than normal, the demand for our water may decrease and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nDecreased residential customer water consumption as a result of water conservation efforts may harm demand for our water service and may reduce our revenues and earnings.\n\ufeff\nThere has been a general decline in water usage per residential customer as a result of an increase in conservation awareness, and the impact of an increased use of more efficient plumbing fixtures and appliances. These gradual, long-term changes are normally taken into account by the utility commissions in setting rates, whereas short-term changes in water usage, if significant, may not be fully reflected in the rates we charge. We are dependent upon the revenue generated from rates charged to our residential customers for the volume of water used. If we are unable to obtain future rate increases to offset decreased residential customer water consumption to cover our investments, expenses, and return for which we initially sought the rate increase, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.\n\ufeff\nDrought conditions and government imposed water use restrictions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers, and may impact our customers' use of our water, which may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers. Drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could harm our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers. An interruption in our water supply could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions, which may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe employ a portfolio rationalization strategy to focus our operations in areas where we have critical mass and economic growth potential and to divest operations where limited customer growth opportunities exist or where we are unable to achieve favorable operating results or a return on equity that we consider acceptable. Dispositions we decide to undertake may involve risks which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nIn the event we determine a division, utility system or business should be sold, we may be unable to reach terms that are agreeable to us or find a suitable buyer. If the business is part of our regulated operations, we may face additional challenges in obtaining regulatory approval for the disposition, and the regulatory approval obtained may include restrictive conditions. We may be required to continue to hold or assume residual liabilities with respect to the business sold. The negotiation of potential dispositions as well as the efforts to divest the acquired business could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management\u2019s time and resources. Any of these risks may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur operations are geographically concentrated in Pennsylvania, which make us susceptible to risks affecting Pennsylvania.\n\ufeff\nAlthough we operate water and wastewater facilities in a number of states, our operations are concentrated in Pennsylvania. As a result, our financial results are largely subject to political, water supply, labor, utility cost and regulatory risks, economic conditions, natural disasters and other risks affecting Pennsylvania.\n\ufeff\nGeneral economic conditions may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nA general economic downturn may lead to a number of impacts on our business and may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such impacts may include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\na reduction in discretionary and recreational water use by our residential water customers, particularly during the summer months when such discretionary usage is normally at its highest;\n\u00b7\na decline in usage by industrial and commercial customers as a result of decreased business activity;\n\u00b7\nan increased incidence of customers\u2019 inability to pay or delays in paying their utility bills, or an increase in customer bankruptcies, which may lead to higher bad debt expense and reduced cash flow;\n\u00b7\na lower natural customer growth rate due to a decline in new housing starts; and\n\u00b7\na decline in the number of active customers due to housing vacancies.\n\ufeff\nGeneral economic turmoil may also lead to an investment market downturn, which may result in our pension and other post-retirement plans\u2019 asset market values suffering a decline and significant volatility. A decline in our plans\u2019 asset market values could increase our required cash contributions to the plans and expense in subsequent years.\n\ufeff\nOur water and wastewater systems may be subject to condemnations or other methods of taking by governmental entities.\n\ufeff\nIn the states where our subsidiaries operate, it is possible that portions of our subsidiaries\u2019 operations could be acquired by municipal governments by one or more of the following methods:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\neminent domain;\n\u00b7\nthe right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original franchise was granted; and\n\u00b7\nthe right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its permit.\n\ufeff\nThe price to be paid upon such an acquisition by the municipal government is usually determined in accordance with applicable law under eminent domain. In other instances, the price may be negotiated, fixed by appraisers selected by the parties or computed in accordance with a formula prescribed in the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter. We believe that our operating subsidiaries will be entitled to receive fair market value for any assets that are condemned. However, there is no assurance that the fair market value received for assets condemned will be in excess of book value.\n\ufeff\nIn a very few number of instances, in one of our southern states where there are municipally-owned water or wastewater systems near our operating divisions, the municipally-owned system may either have water distribution or wastewater collection mains that are located adjacent to our division's mains or may construct new mains that parallel our mains. In these circumstances, on occasion, the municipally-owned system may attempt to offer service to customers who are connected to our mains, resulting in our mains becoming surplus or underutilized without compensation.\n\ufeff\nThe final determination of our income tax liability may be materially different from our income tax provision.\n\ufeff\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Our calculation of the provision for income taxes is subject to our interpretation of applicable business tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. In December 2012, Aqua Pennsylvania changed its tax method of accounting to permit the expensing of\nqualifying utility asset improvement costs that were previously being capitalized and depreciated for tax purposes. Subsequently, the Company\u2019s Ohio and North Carolina regulated subsidiaries similarly changed their tax method of accounting. Our determination of what qualifies as a capital cost versus a tax deduction for utility asset improvements is subject to subsequent adjustment and may impact the income tax benefits that have been recognized.\n\ufeff\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law legislation referred to as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (the \u201cTCJA\u201d). Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA makes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and the taxation of business entities, and includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. Changes in the Code from the TCJA had a material impact on our financial statements in 2017. Significant changes that impact the Company in the TCJA include a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and a limitation on the utilization of Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. In addition, specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the TCJA generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the elimination of full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired after September 27, 2017, and the continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. Since the tax effects of changes in tax law must be recognized in the period in which TCJA was enacted, our deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been remeasured in the period of enactment. This generally results in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers, generally through reductions in future rates. In certain states there is not yet complete guidance as to how to account for the TCJA. With respect to these states, we will account for the changes in income tax balances by making a reasonable estimate. The estimate may differ from the actual tax amount determined once the state regulators provide specific guidance. To the extent such estimates are adjusted or prove to be incorrect, there could be an impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nAlthough we believe our income tax estimates, including any tax reserves for uncertain tax positions or valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are appropriate, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different; either higher or lower, from what is reflected in our income tax provision. In the event we are assessed additional income taxes, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\ufeff\nFederal and state environmental laws and regulations impose substantial compliance requirements on our operations. Our operating costs could be significantly increased in order to comply with new or stricter regulatory standards imposed by federal and state environmental agencies.\n\ufeff\nOur water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar state laws, and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations establish, among other things, criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the U.S. as well as dam safety, air emissions, and residuals management. Pursuant to these laws, we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be at all times in total compliance with these laws, regulations and permits. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators and such noncompliance could result in civil suits. Environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. These laws, and the enforcement thereof, have tended to become more stringent over time. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and our permits, it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will require additional capital expenditures or raise our operating costs. Although these expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that the various state utility commissions that govern our business would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs. In summary, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with, current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFederal and state environmental laws, regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, changes in technology or hydraulic fracturing processes, and volatility in natural gas prices, could result in reduced demand for raw water utilized in hydraulic fracturing and harm our joint venture business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe have invested in a joint venture for the construction and operation of a private pipeline system to supply raw water to natural gas drilling operations for hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection under pressure of water, along with other materials such as sand, into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. In general, the environmental community has taken an interest in monitoring and understanding the potential environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing. Although hydraulic fracturing is currently regulated, in the event the use of hydraulic fracturing is further limited through regulation, our investment in the raw water pipeline may be harmed in the event that demand for raw water is reduced.\n\ufeff\nChanges in technology or hydraulic fracturing processes may occur which allows drillers to reuse injected water on a limited basis, or apply treatment processes to allow further reuse of water for drilling. These changes may reduce demand for raw water.\n\ufeff\nFurthermore, natural gas prices have historically been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile. A decrease in demand for natural gas, due to price volatility, could result in reduced demand for raw water utilized in hydraulic fracturing. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the joint venture recognized an impairment charge on its long-lived assets, which reduced the carrying value of our investment in the joint venture. The impairment resulted from a marked decline in natural gas prices in 2015, a further reduction in the volume of water sales by the joint venture, which led to a lowered forecast on future sales volumes, as well as changes in the natural gas industry activities in the Marcellus Shale region and general market conditions. In the event hydraulic fracturing is limited, due to a further reduction in demand for natural gas or other factors affecting the industry, our investment in the raw water pipeline may be harmed should the demand for raw water be reduced.\n\ufeff\nWastewater operations entail significant risks and may impose significant costs.\n\ufeff\nWastewater collection and treatment and septage pumping and sludge hauling involve various unique risks. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, or if there is a spill, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing various damages and injuries, including environmental damage. These risks are most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of wastewater overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damages and injuries could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWork stoppages and other labor relations matters could harm our operating results.\n\ufeff\nApproximately 34% of our workforce is unionized under 15 labor contracts with labor unions, which expire over several years. In light of rising costs for healthcare and retirement benefits, contract negotiations in the future may be difficult. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor actions as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot assure you that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.\n\ufeff\nSignificant or prolonged disruptions in the supply of important goods or services from third parties could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are dependent on a continuing flow of important goods and services from suppliers for our water and wastewater businesses. A disruption or prolonged delays in obtaining important supplies or services, such as maintenance services, purchased water, chemicals, water pipe, valves, hydrants, electricity, or other materials, could harm our water or wastewater services and our ability to operate in compliance with all regulatory requirements, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In some circumstances, we rely on third parties to provide important services (such as customer bill print and mail activities or utility service operations in some of our divisions) and a disruption in these services could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Some possible reasons for a delay or disruption in the supply of important goods and services include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nour suppliers may not provide materials that meet our specifications in sufficient quantities;\n\u00b7\nour suppliers may provide us with water that does not meet applicable quality standards or is contaminated;\n\u00b7\nour suppliers may face production delays due to natural disasters, strikes, lock-outs, or other such actions;\n\u00b7\none or more suppliers could make strategic changes in the lines of products and services they offer; and\n\u00b7\nsome of our suppliers, such as small companies, may be more likely to experience financial and operational difficulties than larger, well-established companies, because of their limited financial and other resources.\n\ufeff\nAs a result of any of these factors, we may be required to find alternative suppliers for the materials and services on which we rely. Accordingly, we may experience delays in obtaining appropriate materials and services on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities from such alternative suppliers at a reasonable price, which could interrupt services to our customers and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nClimate change laws and regulations have been passed and are being proposed that require compliance with greenhouse gas emissions standards, as well as other climate change initiatives, which could impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nClimate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d), including carbon dioxide. Climate change laws and regulations enacted and proposed limit GHG emissions from covered entities, and require additional monitoring/reporting. At this time, the existing GHG laws and regulations are not expected to materially harm the Company\u2019s operations or capital expenditures. While the trend of increased regulation on climate change could change in light of the current federal administration\u2019s agenda, the uncertainty of future climate change regulatory requirements still remains. We cannot predict the potential impact of future laws and regulations on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Although these future expenditures and costs for regulatory compliance may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that the various state utility commissions that govern our business would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs.\n\ufeff\nSome scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future, possibly created by the climate change greenhouse gases. Changing severe weather patterns could require additional expenditures to reduce the risk associated with any increasing storm, flood and drought occurrences.\n\ufeff\nThe issue of climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide. Many climate change predictions, if true, present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, such as: increased frequency and duration of droughts, increased precipitation and flooding, potential degradation of water quality, and changes in demand for services. We maintain an ongoing facility planning process, and this planning or the enactment of new standards may result in the need for additional capital expenditures or raise our operating costs. Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate change, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Although any potential expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that the various state utility commissions that govern our business would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs. We cannot assure you that our costs of complying with any climate change weather related measures will not harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 52898, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "WTRG"}
