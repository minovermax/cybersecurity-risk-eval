{"cik": "1577916", "company": "Premier, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, operations, and financial position are subject to various risks. An investment in our Class A common stock involves a degree of risk. Before evaluating our Company or making an investment in our Class A common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this annual report. Any of the risks described below could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. This section does not describe all risks that are or may become applicable to us, our industry, or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors. Some statements in this annual report, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. See the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d More detailed information concerning other risk factors as well as those described below is contained in other sections of this annual report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face intense competition, which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry, and if we do not maintain or expand our market share our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe deliver products and services through two business segments: supply chain services and performance services. The market for our products and services in each segment is fragmented, intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology and product standards, user needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services.\nThe primary competitors to our supply chain services segment are other large GPOs such as HealthTrust Purchasing Group (a subsidiary of HCA Holdings, Inc.), Managed Health Care Associates, Inc., MedAssets, Inc. and Novation LLC. In addition, we compete against certain healthcare provider-owned GPOs in this segment. Our specialty pharmacy competes with Caremark Inc. (owned by CVS Caremark Corporation), Curascript, Inc./Accredo (owned by Express Scripts Holding Co.), Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy and many smaller local specialty pharmacies. Finally, our direct sourcing activities compete primarily with private label offerings/programs, product manufacturers and distributors, such as Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corporation, Medline Industries, Inc. and Owens & Minor, Inc.\nThe competitors in our performance services segment range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities. Our primary competitors in this segment include (i) information technology providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Caradigm USA LLC, Cerner Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Oracle Corporation and Truven Health Analytics Inc., and (ii) consulting and outsourcing firms such as The Advisory Board Company, Deloitte & Touche LLP, Evolent Health, Inc., Healthagen, LLC (a subsidiary of Aetna, Inc.), Huron Consulting, Inc., Navigant Consulting, Inc. and Optum, Inc. (a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, Inc.).\nWith respect to our products and services across both segments, we compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvement through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition and the ability to integrate services with existing technology. Some of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater name recognition, have larger member bases and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Other of our competitors have proprietary technology that differentiates their product and service offerings from ours. As a result of these competitive advantages, our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to market forces, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands, products and services, and make more attractive offers to our members.\nWith respect to our products and services across both of our segments, we also compete on the basis of price. We may be subject to pricing pressures as a result of, among other things, competition within the industry, consolidation of healthcare industry participants, practices of managed care organizations, government action affecting reimbursement and financial stress experienced by our members. If our pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business will be less profitable and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our current members or expand our member base in this competitive environment. If we do not retain current members or expand our member base, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the healthcare information technology and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could also adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. We expect regulatory and economic conditions to force additional consolidation in the healthcare industry in the future. As consolidation accelerates, the economies of scale of our members\u2019 organizations may grow. If a member experiences sizable growth following consolidation, it may determine that it no longer needs to rely on us and may reduce its demand for our products and services. Some of these large and growing healthcare systems may choose to contract directly with suppliers for certain supply categories, and some suppliers may seek to contract directly with the healthcare providers rather than with GPOs such as ours. In connection with any consolidation, certain of our members may also move their business to another GPO. In addition, as healthcare providers consolidate to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power, these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions for our products and services across both of our business segments. Finally, consolidation may also result in the acquisition or future development by our members of products and services that compete with our products and services. Any of these potential results of consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant delays in, or an inability to increase, revenue if the sales cycle with potential new members takes longer than anticipated.\nA key element of our strategy is to market the various products and services in our supply chain services and performance services segments directly to healthcare providers, such as health systems and acute care hospitals, and to increase the number of our products and services utilized by existing members. The evaluation process is often lengthy and involves significant technical evaluation and commitment of personnel by these organizations. Further, the evaluation process depends on a number of factors, many of which we may not be able to control, including potential new members\u2019 internal approval processes, budgetary constraints for technology spending, member concerns about implementing new procurement methods and strategies and other timing effects. If we experience an extended or delayed sales cycle in connection with the sale of additional products and services to existing or new members, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMember participation in our GPO programs may be terminated with limited or no notice and/or without significant termination payments. If our members reduce activity levels or terminate or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue and results of operations may decrease materially.\nIn connection with the Reorganization, we entered into new GPO participation agreements with all of our member owners existing immediately prior to the completion of the Reorganization. These GPO participation agreements are generally terminable at any time by either party, upon one year\u2019s prior written notice, in the event of a change of control of the member owner, and are also terminable for convenience upon one year\u2019s prior written notice, at any time after the second anniversary of the beginning of the applicable term, as well as terminable for cause under certain circumstances (including, due to a material breach of the terms of the GPO participation agreement). Also, in the event that a member owner ceases to be a party to a GPO participation agreement (except in certain limited circumstances), Premier LP will have the option to redeem all of such member owner\u2019s Class B common units pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"Exchange Agreement\") at a purchase price set forth in the LP Agreement. Our success in retaining member participation in our GPO programs depends upon our reputation, strong relationships with such members and our ability to deliver consistent, reliable and high quality products and services. We believe that establishing and maintaining a good professional reputation and name recognition are critical for attracting and retaining member participation in our GPO programs. Promotion and enhancement of our name will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide high quality products and services. Therefore, our brand name and reputation will suffer if members do not perceive our products and services to be effective or of high quality or if there are inaccuracies or defects in our solutions.\nMembers may also seek to reduce, cancel or elect not to renew their contracts due to factors that are beyond our control and are unrelated to our performance, including their business or financial condition, changes in their strategies or business plans or economic conditions in general.\nWhen contracts are reduced, cancelled or not renewed for any reason, we lose the anticipated future revenue associated with such contracts and, consequently, our revenue and results of operations may decrease materially. Additionally, the loss of any of our members could negatively impact our membership-driven business model strategy.\nOur business strategy that involves reducing the prices for certain products and services in our supply chain services segment may not be successful, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to maintain and develop new relationships with members in our supply chain services segment, we look for ways to reduce the prices that they pay for products and services. However, success in serving the members by reducing the prices they pay suppliers for products and services will reduce the administrative fees we receive in respect of such transactions that correlate to such prices.\nIn order to maintain or increase our revenues and margins while implementing these strategies, we would have to increase sales volumes of existing products and services or introduce and sell new products and services in amounts sufficient to compensate for the reduced revenue effect of price reductions. If our competitors in these lines of business similarly reduce or obtain lower prices for their members, as applicable, this may create further financial, operational and strategic challenges. We cannot assure you that our business strategies will be successful, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets for our non-GPO services and products may develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely affect our revenue and our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\nWhile the products and services in our non-GPO lines of business are becoming more accepted, the market for these products and services remains narrowly based, and it is uncertain whether these products and services will achieve and sustain the high levels of demand and market acceptance we anticipate. Our ability to materially grow our revenues and achieve and sustain profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from strategic initiatives relating to businesses other than the GPO business, particularly if those businesses do not grow significantly. We are currently focusing on data analytics and other technology opportunities and our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of existing and potential new members, large and small, to increase their use of our SaaS informatics products. Many companies have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to our services. Furthermore, some companies may be reluctant or unwilling to use our services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability of, among other things, the technology delivery model associated with these services. If companies do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur members are highly dependent on payments from third-party healthcare payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored programs, and reductions or changes in third-party reimbursement could adversely affect these members and consequently our business.\nOur members derive a substantial portion of their revenue from third-party private and governmental payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government sponsored programs. Our sales and profitability depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage of and reimbursement for our products and services our members purchase or otherwise obtain through us is available to our members from governmental health programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other third-party payers. These third-party payers are increasingly using their enhanced bargaining power to secure discounted reimbursement rates and may impose other requirements that adversely impact our members\u2019 ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products and services.\nIf third-party payers do not approve products for reimbursement or fail to reimburse for them adequately, our members may suffer adverse financial consequences which, in turn, may reduce the demand for and ability to purchase our products or services. In addition, CMS, which administers the Medicare and federal aspects of state Medicaid programs, has issued complex rules requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to calculate and report drug pricing for multiple purposes, including the limiting of reimbursement for certain drugs. These rules generally exclude from the pricing calculation administrative fees paid by drug manufacturers to GPOs to the extent that such fees meet CMS\u2019s \u201cbona fide service fee\u201d definition. There can be no assurance that CMS will continue to allow exclusion of GPO administrative fees from the pricing calculation, which could negatively affect the willingness of pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay administrative fees to us. Any such changes, as well as other current and future efforts by payers to limit reimbursement for certain drugs may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment actions could also limit government spending generally for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, limit payments to healthcare providers, and increase emphasis on competition and other programs that could have an adverse effect on our members. Specifically, CMS may implement a competitive bidding program for selected items paid for by the Medicare program. We cannot predict which products and services we offer will ultimately be affected or whether or when the competitive bidding process will\nbe extended to our businesses. The implementation of the competitive bidding program could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the administrative fees we receive from our GPO suppliers and the failure to maintain contracts with these GPO suppliers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A termination of any relationship or agreement with a GPO supplier could also negatively affect our relationships with our members.\nHistorically, we have derived a substantial amount of our revenue from the administrative fees that we receive from our GPO suppliers. We maintain contractual relationships with these suppliers who provide products and services to our members at reduced costs and who pay us administrative fees based on the dollars spent by our members for such products and services. Therefore, we rely heavily on our relationships with our GPO suppliers. Supplier commitment to our GPO has been, and will continue to be, a crucial element to our supply chain services business model. There can be no assurances that our relationships with our suppliers will continue on existing terms or at all. Our contracts with these GPO suppliers generally may be terminated upon 90 days\u2019 notice. A termination of any relationship or agreement with a GPO supplier would result in the loss of administrative fees pursuant to our arrangement with that supplier, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot demonstrate to our suppliers the value of our GPO or other products and services, we may lose contracts or favorable contract terms with our suppliers which may result in our inability to maintain our member agreements or win new business. In addition, if we lose a relationship with a GPO supplier we may not be able to negotiate similar arrangements for our members with other suppliers on the same terms and conditions or at all, which could damage our reputation with our members and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with third-party providers or maintain or enter into new strategic alliances, we may be unable to grow our current base business.\nOur business strategy includes entering into and maintaining strategic alliances and affiliations with leading service providers and other GPOs. We work closely with our members to penetrate new product markets and expand our current market capabilities. We may not achieve our objectives through these relationships or through our relationships with our third-party providers or strategic alliances. Many of these companies have multiple relationships and they may not regard us as significant to their business. These companies may pursue relationships with our competitors, develop or acquire products and services that compete with our products and services, experience financial difficulties, be acquired by one of our competitors or other third party or exit the healthcare industry, any of which may adversely affect our relationship with them. In addition, in many cases, these companies may terminate their relationships with us for any reason with limited or no notice. If existing relationships with third-party providers or strategic alliances are adversely impacted or are terminated or we are unable to enter into relationships with leading healthcare service providers and other GPOs, we may be unable to maintain or increase our industry presence.\nIf we are not able to offer new and innovative products and services, we may not remain competitive and our revenue and results of operations may suffer.\nOur success depends on providing products and services within our supply chain services and performance services segments that healthcare providers use to improve clinical, financial and operational performance. Our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become viewed as more efficient or appealing to our members. If we cannot adapt to rapidly evolving industry standards, technology and member needs, including changing regulations and provider reimbursement policies, we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential new members\u2019 requirements that could make our existing technology, products or service offerings obsolete. Additionally, some healthcare information technology providers have begun to incorporate enhanced analytical tools and functionality into their core product and service offerings used by healthcare providers. These developments may adversely impact the demand for our products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing products and services, maintain or improve our product category rankings and introduce new high quality products and services that members and potential new members will want. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our members or potential new members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market. Many of our existing member relationships are nonexclusive or terminable on short notice, or otherwise terminable after a specified term. If our new or modified product and service innovations are not responsive to member preferences, emerging industry standards or regulatory changes, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market, we may lose existing members and be unable to obtain new members and our results of operations may suffer. In addition, cancellation of any of our products and services after implementation has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and resources invested in the cancelled implementation as well as lost opportunity for acquiring other members over that same period of time.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our largest members.\nOur top five members, who are all participants in our group purchasing programs, comprised approximately 19% of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal year 2015. Our largest member, GNYHA Purchasing Alliance, LLC and its member organizations, comprised approximately 9.3% of our consolidated net revenues for the same period. The sudden loss of any of our members that are participants in our group purchasing programs could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, certain of our top five members are themselves GPOs with their own respective direct contracting relationships, including relationships with some of our other members. The sudden loss of any of these members may also result in increased competition for our supply chain services segment and the loss of any of these additional members could also materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences.\nOur business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. Future acquisitions may not be completed on the most favorable terms and acquired assets or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations. Any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. Such risks include, among other things:\n\u2022\nfailing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner;\n\u2022\nassuming potential liabilities of an acquired company, some of which may not become known until after the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe acquired company's lack of compliance with laws and governmental rules and regulations, and the related costs and expenses necessary to bring such entity into compliance;\n\u2022\nmanaging the potential disruption to our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndistracting management focus from our core businesses;\n\u2022\nhaving difficulties in identifying and acquiring products, technologies, or businesses that will help our business;\n\u2022\nentering new markets in which we have little to no experience;\n\u2022\nimpairing relationships with employees, members, and strategic partners,\n\u2022\nfailing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe amortization of purchased intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits; and\n\u2022\ndiluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.\nThe anticipated benefits of our previous acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions of under-performing businesses could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. We anticipate that acquisitions will play a larger role in our business strategy in the future, and there can be no assurances that any future acquisitions will be successful.\nIn addition, expenses associated with potential acquisitions, including among other things, due diligence costs, legal, accounting, technology and financial advisor fees, travel, and internal resources utilization can be significant. These expenses are required to be incurred regardless of the outcome on any potential acquisition opportunity. In instances where acquisitions are not ultimately completed these expenses typically cannot be recovered or offset by the anticipated financial benefits of a successful acquisition. As we pursue our business strategy and evaluate opportunities, these expenses may adversely impact our results of operations and earnings per share.\nOur business and growth strategy also includes non-controlling investments in other businesses. In the event these investments do not perform as well as expected, we could experience a material adverse effect on the value of our investment that could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and our Class A common stock price.\nPrior to investing in other businesses, we conduct accounting, financial, legal and business due diligence. However, notwithstanding such due diligence efforts, we cannot guarantee that we will discover all material issues that may affect a particular target business, or that factors outside the control of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. In addition, to the extent we invest in a financially underperforming or unstable company or an entity in its development stage that does not successfully mature, we may lose the value of our investment. Generally, current and future investments are, and will be, made on a non-controlling\nbasis, so we have limited ability to influence the financial or business operations of the companies in which we invest. If our investment loses value, we may be required to write down or write off our investment, or recognize impairment or other charges that could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and our stock price. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have a material impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us, our business strategy or our common stock.\nWe are subject to litigation from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in businesses that are subject to substantial litigation. We are periodically involved in litigation, which from time to time may include claims relating to commercial, product liability, employment, antitrust, intellectual property or other regulatory matters, among others. If current or future government regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, specifically those with respect to antitrust or healthcare laws, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties, and other material limitations on our business.\nFrom time to time, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits brought by suppliers of medical products. Typically, these lawsuits have alleged the existence of a conspiracy among manufacturers of competing products and operators of GPOs, including us, to deny the plaintiff access to a market for its products. No assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to similar actions in the future or that such matters will be resolved in a manner satisfactory to us or which will not harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become subject to additional litigation in the future. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to defend ourselves vigorously; however, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of the Class A common stock. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured and adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors. In addition, certain litigation matters could adversely impact our commercial reputation, which is critical for attracting and retaining member participation in our GPO programs and suppliers.\nWe rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties, and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users, adversely affecting our brand and our business.\nOur ability to deliver our performance services segment products is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telephone, facsimile, and pager systems. Our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments. However, we have experienced and expect that we will experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party suppliers, including bandwidth and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our services. We are also currently in the process of migrating some of our data center operations to third-party data-hosting facilities. We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss, and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures, and crashes;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, computer viruses, and similar disruptive problems; and\n\u2022\nother potential interruptions.\nAny disruption in the network access, telecommunications, or co-location services provided by these third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business. We exercise limited control over these third-party suppliers, which increases our vulnerability to problems\nwith services they provide. Any errors, failures, interruptions, or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and adversely affect our business and could expose us to third-party liabilities. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.\nThe reliability and performance of the Internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the Internet to us for delivery of our Internet-based services.\nData loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems and service disruptions at our data centers may adversely affect our reputation and relationships with existing members, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our members regard as significant. Complex software such as ours may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released. We continually introduce new software and updates and enhancements to our software. Despite testing by us, from time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our software, and such defects or errors may be discovered in the future. Any defects or errors could expose us to risk of liability to members and the government and could cause delays in the introduction of new products and services, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, require design modifications, decrease market acceptance or member satisfaction with our products and services or cause harm to our reputation.\nFurthermore, our members might use our software together with products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts, impact our reputation and lead to significant member relations problems.\nMoreover, our internal data centers and service provider locations store and transmit critical member data that is essential to our business. While these locations are chosen for their stability, failover capabilities, and system controls, we do not directly control the continued or uninterrupted availability of every location. In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we are currently in the process of migrating some of our data center operations to third-party data-hosting facilities. Data center facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. These service interruption events could impair our ability to deliver services or deliverables or cause us to miss service level agreements in our agreements with our members, which could negatively affect our ability to retain existing members and attract new members.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access is obtained to a member\u2019s data, or our members fail to obtain proper permissions for the use and disclosure of information, our services may be perceived as not being secure, members may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur services involve the web-based storage and transmission of members\u2019 proprietary information and protected health information of patients. Because of the sensitivity of this information, security features of our software are very important. From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if they do not result in a security breach, may reduce member confidence and require substantial resources to address. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design, or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to member or patient data. As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, and significant costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences.\nWe rely upon our members as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of member-side access credential verification and control of member-side display of data. On occasion, our members have failed to perform these activities. Failure of members to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced, which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched\nagainst a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and members. In addition, our members may authorize or enable third parties to access their data or the data of their patients on our systems. Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems. Any breach of our security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we require our members in both of our business segments to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so. If they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws. Any such failure to obtain proper permissions and waivers could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data. In addition, such a failure could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us. Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of our lack of a valid notice, permission, or waiver. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other third parties.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system.\nThe costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential members that may impede our critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our members or other third parties could expose us, our members, or other third parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation, governmental inquiry and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we rely in certain limited capacities on third-party data management providers whose possible security problems and security.\nAny restrictions on our use of, or ability to license, data, or our failure to license data and integrate third-party technologies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon licenses from third parties for some of the technology and data used in our applications, and for some of the technology platforms upon which these applications are built and operate, including IBM and 3M. We also obtain a portion of the data that we use from government entities, public records and from our members for specific member engagements. We believe that we have all rights necessary to use the data that is incorporated into our products and services. However, we cannot assure you that our licenses for information will allow us to use that information for all potential or contemplated applications and products. In addition, certain of our informatics products depend on maintaining our data and analytics platform, which is populated with data disclosed to us by our members. If these members revoked their consent for us to maintain, use, de-identify and share this data, consistent with applicable law, our data assets could be degraded.\nIn the future, data providers could withdraw their data from us or restrict our usage for any reason, including if there is a competitive reason to do so, if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data, or if judicial interpretations are issued restricting use of the data that we currently use in our products and services. In addition, data providers could fail to adhere to our quality control standards in the future, causing us to incur additional expense to appropriately utilize the data. If a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw or restrict their data, or if they fail to adhere to our quality control standards, and if we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our service offerings, our ability to provide products and services to our members would be materially adversely impacted and it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also integrate into our proprietary applications and use third-party software to maintain and enhance, among other things, content generation and delivery, and to support our technology infrastructure. Some of this software is proprietary and some is open source. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. These technologies may not be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could be difficult to replace once integrated into our own proprietary applications (although we currently believe this risk is remote given the \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d nature of these licenses and that standard operating procedures and practices utilized by these third parties would generally afford us sufficient time to effectively transition to other readily available sources without significant long-term impact to our business). Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time. Our inability to obtain, maintain or comply with any of these licenses could delay development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. In addition, if our data suppliers choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future, we might not be able to modify or adapt our own solutions.\nWe may rely on partners and other third parties to provide members with a single-source solution.\nFrom time to time, we may engage teaming partners or other third parties to provide our members with a single-source solution. For example, through partnerships with suppliers we offer performance improvement collaboratives and clinical, financial and operational SaaS informatics products, such as PopulationFocus, CareFocus, NetworkFocus and QualityAdvisor. While we believe that we perform appropriate due diligence on our teaming partners and other third parties, we cannot guarantee that those parties will comply with the terms set forth in their agreements. We may have disputes with our teaming partners or other third parties arising from the quality and timeliness of their work, member concerns about them or other matters. Performance deficiencies or misconduct by our teaming partners or other third parties could result in a member terminating our contract for default and/or could adversely affect our member relationships. We may be exposed to liability and we and our members may be adversely affected if a teaming partner or other third party fails to meet its contractual obligations.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\nThe products or technologies acquired, licensed or developed by us may incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example, the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, \u201cApache-style\u201d licenses, \u201cBerkeley Software Distribution,\u201d \u201cBSD-style\u201d licenses and other open source licenses. There is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses, and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is unknown and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and technologies. For example, we may be subjected to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our products that use particular open source software at no cost to the user, that we make available the source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license.\nIf an author or other party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. If our defenses were not successful, we could be subject to significant damages, be enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained the open source software, and be required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our products. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, under some open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, which could substantially help our competitors develop products that are similar to or better than ours.\nChanges in industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance.\nContracts in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with our specialty pharmacy members, generally use \u201caverage wholesale price,\u201d or AWP, which is published by a third party, as a benchmark to establish pricing for prescription drugs.\nVarious federal and state government agencies and prosecutors, as well as legislators and private litigants, have challenged the use of AWP for prescription drug reimbursement, as well as the manner by which AWP is calculated. In 2011, First DataBank, a significant provider of AWP information, discontinued publishing such information. Other publishers, such as MediSpan, reduced their reported AWP prices. These events have raised uncertainties as to whether certain third parties will continue to publish AWP, which may result in the inability of payers, pharmacy providers and others in the prescription drug industry to continue to utilize AWP as it has previously been calculated, or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing pricing within the industry. Due to these uncertainties, we are unable to anticipate what, if any, future impact this will have on our member contracts or our business strategy generally. Therefore, we can give no assurance that the short or long-term impact of such changes to industry pricing benchmarks will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nPrescription volumes may decline, and our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted, if the safety risk profiles of drugs increase or if drugs are withdrawn from the market, including as a result of manufacturing issues, or if prescription drugs transition to over-the-counter products.\nWe dispense significant volumes of brand-name and generic drugs from our specialty pharmacies. When increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs result in utilization decreases, physicians may cease writing or otherwise reduce the numbers of prescriptions for these drugs. Additionally, negative press regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced global consumer demand for such drugs. On occasion, products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to over-the-counter products. In cases where there are no acceptable prescription drug equivalents or alternatives for these prescription drugs, our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline.\nOur ability to grow our specialty pharmacy could be limited if we do not maintain and expand our existing base of drugs, if we lose patients or if manufacturers limit or cease doing business with us.\nOur specialty pharmacy focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively small patient population. Due to this limited patient population, our future growth relies in part on maintaining and expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Sales volumes at our specialty pharmacy could also be negatively impacted due to increases in the safety risk profiles or manufacturing issues of specific drugs, product withdrawals by manufacturers or transitions to over-the-counter products. Any loss of patient base or reduction in demand for any reason for the medications we currently dispense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, industry trends may result in health plans contracting with a single provider for specialty pharmacy services and manufacturers limiting their business with regional providers of these services. If we are unable to obtain managed care contracts in the areas in which we provide specialty pharmacy services or are unable to obtain specialty pharmacy products at reasonable costs or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur direct sourcing activities depend on contract manufacturing facilities located in various parts of the world, and any physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, labor or operational disruption or product quality issues could result in a reduction in sales volumes and the incurrence of substantial expenditures.\nAs part of our direct sourcing activities, which are a part of our supply chain services segment, we contract with manufacturing facilities in various parts of the world, including facilities in China, which are subject to operating hazards and interruptions. Operations at these manufacturing facilities could be curtailed or partially or completely shut down, temporarily or permanently, as the result of a number of circumstances, most of which are outside of our control, such as unscheduled maintenance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, or political unrest. Any significant curtailment of production at these facilities, or production issue resulting in a substandard product, could result in litigation, governmental inquiry, or materially reduced revenues and cash flow in our direct sourcing activities. In addition our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.\nA substantial portion of the manufacturing for our direct sourcing activities is conducted in China. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the degree of government involvement, the level of development, the growth rate, the control of foreign exchange, access to financing and the allocation of resources. Additionally, the facilities in China with which we contract are particularly susceptible to rising labor costs and interruptions as a result of minimum wage laws, scheduling and overtime requirements, labor disputes and strikes.\nIf we lose key personnel or if we are unable to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel, our business would be harmed.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel. Our future success also depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key personnel, each of whom may be difficult to replace. In particular, Susan D. DeVore, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael J. Alkire, our Chief Operating Officer, Craig S. McKasson, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Keith J. Figlioli, our Senior Vice President of Healthcare Informatics, and Durral R. Gilbert, our President of Supply Chain Services are critical to the management of our business and operations and the development of our strategic direction. The loss of services of Ms. DeVore, Messrs. Alkire, McKasson, Figlioli, Gilbert or any of our other executive officers or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The replacement of any of these key individuals would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to identify, hire and retain other highly skilled technical, managerial, editorial, sales, marketing and customer service professionals. Competition for such personnel is intense. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. We cannot be certain of our ability to identify, hire and retain adequately qualified personnel. Failure to identify, hire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the protection of our intellectual property is inadequate, our competitors may gain access to our technology or confidential information and we may lose our competitive advantage.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.\nWe utilize a combination of internal and external measures to protect our proprietary software and confidential information. Such measures include contractual protections with employees, contractors, members, and partners, as well as U.S. copyright laws.\nWe protect the intellectual property in our software pursuant to customary contractual protections in our agreements that impose restrictions on our members\u2019 ability to use such software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by relying on internal policies applicable to our employees and consultants that acknowledge our ownership of all intellectual property developed by the individual during the course of his or her work with us. These member agreements and internal policies applicable to our employees and consultants also require each person to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information disclosed to them. Other parties may not comply with the terms of these agreements and policies, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. The disclosure to, or independent development by, a competitor of any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent could materially adversely affect any competitive advantage we may have over any such competitor.\nThese protections may not be adequate, and we cannot assure you that they will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Other companies could independently develop similar or competing technology without violating our proprietary rights. The process of enforcing our intellectual property rights through legal proceedings would likely be burdensome and expensive, and our ultimate success cannot be assured. Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are deemed to infringe, misappropriate or violate the proprietary rights of third parties, we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services.\nWe could be subject to intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other intellectual property violation claims as our applications\u2019 functionality overlaps with competitive products and third parties may claim that we do not own or have rights to use all intellectual property rights used in the conduct of our business. We do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any valid or enforceable proprietary rights of third parties. However, we cannot assure you that infringement, misappropriation or claims alleging intellectual property violations will not be asserted against us. Also, we cannot assure you that any such claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any such claims. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. In addition, we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such claims also might require indemnification of our members at significant expense.\nIn addition, a number of our contracts with our members contain indemnity provisions whereby we indemnify them against certain losses that may arise from third-party claims that are brought in connection with the use of our products.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have limited visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the products and services we sell in certain jurisdictions or intend to sell online, we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, future sales may decrease and our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nRules and regulations applicable to sales and use tax vary significantly by tax jurisdiction. In addition, the applicability of these rules given the nature of our products and services is subject to change.\nWe may lose sales or incur significant costs should various tax jurisdictions be successful in imposing sales and use taxes on a broader range of products and services than those currently so taxed, including products and services sold online. A successful assertion by one or more taxing authorities that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our solutions could result in substantial tax liabilities for past and future sales, decrease our ability to compete and otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, sales tax is currently not imposed on the administrative fees we collect in connection with our GPO programs. If sales tax were imposed in the future on such fees, the profitability of our GPO programs may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our products and services, including products and services sold online, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes (and the associated interest and penalties) and if our members fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned costs that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our members and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing members or to gain new members in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available or, if it is available, may result in dilution to our then-existing stockholders and decreased stock prices for our Class A common stock.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to:\n\u2022\nfinance unanticipated working capital requirements;\n\u2022\ndevelop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services;\n\u2022\nfund strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nacquire complementary businesses, assets, technologies, products or services.\nAdditional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our expansion strategy, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance technology or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our then-existing stockholders may be diluted, and holders of these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders. In addition, the issuance of dilutive securities may have downward price pressures on the trading prices of our Class A common stock.\nOur future indebtedness could adversely affect our business and our liquidity position.\nOn June 24, 2014, we entered into a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes an accordion feature granting us the ability to increase the size of the facility by an additional $250 million on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the parties. As of June 30, 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility.\nOur indebtedness may increase from time to time in the future for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. Any indebtedness we incur and restrictive covenants contained in the agreements related thereto could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including making interest payments on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt, reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and working capital and other general operational requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to some of our competitors that have less debt than us;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pursue acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause a significant decrease in our liquidity and impair our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness.\nOur unsecured revolving credit facility contains, among other things, restrictive covenants that will limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The credit facility restricts, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or issue guarantees, create liens on our assets, make distributions on or redeem equity interests, make investments, transfer or sell properties or other assets, and engage in mergers, consolidations or acquisitions. Furthermore, the credit facility requires us to meet specified financial ratios and tests. In addition, any debt securities we may issue in the future may have similar or more restrictive financial or operational covenants that may limit our ability to execute our business strategies or operate our Company.\nOur cash flows, quarterly revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of certain factors, some of which may be outside of our control.\nCertain of our member contracts contain terms that result in revenue that is deferred and cannot be recognized until the occurrence of certain events. For example, accounting principles do not allow us to recognize revenue associated with the implementation of certain products and services in our performance services segment until the implementation has been completed, at which time we begin to recognize revenue over the life of the contract or the estimated remaining member relationship period, whichever is longer. As a result, the period of time between contract signing and recognition of associated revenue may be lengthy, and we are not able to predict with certainty the period in which implementation will be completed.\nCertain of our member agreements provide for guaranteed levels of savings in which some portion or all of our fees are at risk and refundable if our products and services do not result in the achievement of these financial performance targets. The amount of guaranteed savings in the member agreements in place on June 30, 2015 represent less than 1% of our net revenue in the event that no savings are identified. These member agreements are reviewed and approved by the member agreement review committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of a subset of our independent directors and our president and chief executive officer, in order to manage and protect potential conflict of interest issues with member owners. If we are unable to meet or exceed savings guarantee levels, we may be required to pay any difference between savings that were guaranteed and the savings, if any, which were actually achieved. To the extent that any revenue is subject to contingency for the non-achievement of a performance target, we only recognize revenue upon member confirmation that the financial performance targets have been achieved. If a member fails to provide such confirmation in a timely manner, our ability to recognize revenue will be delayed. Additionally, certain of our contracts include the potential for a payment based on a percentage achieved on certain financial performance targets, which we may or may not earn when expected or at all.\nOur group purchasing services rely on participating suppliers to provide periodic reports of their sales volumes to our members and resulting administrative fees to us. If a supplier fails to provide such reporting in a timely and accurate manner, our ability to recognize administrative fees revenue will be delayed or prevented.\nCertain of our fees are based on timing and volume of member invoices processed and payments received, which are often dependent upon factors outside of our control.\nOther fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations may be due to a number of other factors, some of which are not within our control, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to offer new and innovative products and services;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes, including changes in the healthcare laws;\n\u2022\nunforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs;\n\u2022\nthe purchasing and budgeting cycles of our members;\n\u2022\nthe lengthy sales cycles for our products and services, which may cause significant delays or an inability to generate revenues;\n\u2022\npricing pressures with respect to our future sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of our or our competitors\u2019 new product and service offerings;\n\u2022\nmember decisions, especially those involving our larger member relationships, regarding renewal or termination of their contracts;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs related to the development, adaptation, acquisition, or integration of acquired technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of our current and potential new members; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions and those conditions specific to the healthcare industry.\nWe base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue, and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term. If we have lower revenue than expected, we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response. Any significant shortfall in revenue would have a direct and material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of the Class A common stock could decline substantially. In addition, any adverse impacts on the Class A common stock may harm the overall reputation of our organization, cause us to lose members and impact our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated. Any material changes in the political, economic or regulatory healthcare environment that affect the GPO business or the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations, or that lead to consolidation in the healthcare industry, could require us to modify our services or reduce the funds available to providers to purchase our products and services.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon conditions affecting the healthcare industry generally and hospitals and health systems particularly. Our ability to grow will depend upon the economic environment of the healthcare industry generally as well as our ability to increase the number of programs and services that we sell to our members. The healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal and state authorities and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. Factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses, consolidation in the healthcare industry, regulation, litigation and general economic conditions affect the purchasing practices, operations and the financial health of healthcare organizations. In particular, changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry, such as increased regulation of the purchase and sale of medical products, or restrictions on permissible discounts and other financial arrangements, could require us to make unplanned modifications of our products and services, result in delays or cancellations of orders or reduce funds and demand for our products and services.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is a sweeping measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending, and improve healthcare quality. The law includes provisions to tie Medicare provider reimbursement to healthcare quality and incentives, mandatory compliance programs, enhanced transparency disclosure requirements, increased funding and initiatives to address fraud and abuse, and incentives to state Medicaid programs to promote community-based care as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. In addition, the law provides for the establishment of a national voluntary pilot program to bundle Medicare payments for hospital and post-acute services, which could lead to changes in the delivery of healthcare services. Likewise, many states have adopted or are considering changes in healthcare policies in part due to state budgetary shortfalls. Regulations for implementing many provisions of the Affordable Care Act are being released on an ongoing basis, and we do not know what effect the federal Affordable Care Act or any state law proposals may have on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state laws governing financial relationships among healthcare providers and submission of false or fraudulent claims to government healthcare programs, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in government healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect patients, governmental healthcare programs and private health plans from fraudulent and abusive activities. These laws include anti-kickback restrictions and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims. These laws are complex and their application to our specific products, services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have over time increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other reimbursement laws and rules. From time to time we and others in the healthcare industry have received inquiries or requests to produce documents in connection with such activities. We could be required to expend significant time and resources to comply with these requests, and the attention of our management team could be diverted to these efforts. Furthermore, if we are found to be in violation of any federal or state fraud and abuse laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and we could be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial condition.\nProvisions in Title XI of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value such as gifts, discounts, rebates, waiver of payments or providing anything at less than its fair market value. Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to influence the purchase, lease or ordering of healthcare items and services regardless of whether the item or service is covered under a governmental health program or private health plan. Certain statutory and regulatory safe harbors exist that protect specified business arrangements from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute if all elements of an applicable safe harbor are met, however these safe harbors are narrow and often difficult to comply with. Congress has appropriated an increasing amount of funds in recent years to support enforcement activities aimed at reducing healthcare fraud and abuse. We cannot assure you that our arrangements will be protected by such safe harbors or that such increased enforcement activities will not directly or indirectly have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any determination by a state or federal agency that any of our activities or those of our suppliers or members, violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business, or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs, and, thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General conducted an extensive audit of the business practices of three GPOs, including us, and published a report indicating that of the $1.8 billion in administrative fees that these GPOs collected over a four-year period, $1.3 billion exceeded their operating expenses. Of this amount, $898 million was returned to hospitals. The report found certain deficiencies in the manner in which the hospitals reflected these fees on their cost reports to Medicare. The HHS Office of Inspector General took no enforcement action against us or, to our knowledge, either of the other GPOs. The report did not identify any of our business practices, or relationships with suppliers or our members, which in its view violated the Anti-Kickback Statute. In response to these findings, the HHS Office of Inspector General recommended that CMS provide specific guidance on the proper treatment on Medicare cost reports of revenue distributions received from GPOs. CMS issued an update to its provider reimbursement manual in December 2011 specifying that these distributions must be properly accounted for on such cost reports. The 2005 report and subsequent CMS guidance suggest that the various forms of value received by our U.S. hospital members and health system member owners in connection with or related to the Reorganization and our IPO (including, without limitation, increases in the fair market value of equity held by such member owners, proceeds from the purchase of Class B common units from such member owners immediately following our IPO and as a result of subsequent exchanges, Premier LP cash distributions, administrative fee revenue share paid by Premier LP to our members based upon their member facilities\u2019 purchases through GPO supplier contracts and payments under the tax receivable agreements) should be appropriately reflected in their cost reports to Medicare, and we have sought to structure those arrangements so that they can be appropriately reflected. Our members that report their costs to Medicare are required under the terms of the Premier Group Purchasing Policy to appropriately reflect all elements of value received in connection with the Reorganization and our IPO on their cost reports. We are required to furnish applicable reports to such members setting forth the amount of such value, to assist their compliance with such cost reporting requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that the HHS Office of Inspector General or the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, would concur with such approach. Any determination by a state or federal agency that the provision of such forms of value violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business, or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business\nwith government programs, and, thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the lead-up to our IPO, we received correspondence from one of our major GPO competitors expressing concern that the manner in which our IPO was explained to our current and prospective member owners could violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. One letter attached a brief analysis prepared by the competitor\u2019s outside counsel, which concluded that the opportunity to participate in our IPO could constitute a form of remuneration for purposes of the Anti-Kickback Statute and that if the other requisite elements of an Anti-Kickback Statute violation were present, the extension by us of such opportunity could violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. We believe that our discussions with then-current and prospective member owners regarding our IPO were conducted in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other applicable laws. However, no assurance can be given that enforcement authorities will agree with our assessment. Although a process exists for requesting advisory opinions from the HHS Office of Inspector General regarding compliance of particular arrangements with the Anti-Kickback Statute, we have not sought such an opinion and do not believe that the issues raised in the competitor\u2019s correspondence are capable of being addressed in an advisory opinion since the content and specifics of each discussion would be at issue. Any determination by a state or federal agency that the manner in which the opportunity to participate in our IPO was presented to our member owners and prospective member owners, either in and of itself or when viewed in conjunction with the requirements for ownership in Premier LP and participation in our group purchasing program or the various forms of value received by our member owners in connection with or related to our IPO, violated any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business, or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs, and, thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn July 23, 2013, the HHS Office of Inspector General published Advisory Opinion 13-09 addressing a transaction proposed to be undertaken by the competitor referred to in the preceding paragraph. Under this proposal, the competitor, which is a publicly-traded company, would issue stock to certain of its current and prospective customers in exchange for the customers\u2019 agreement to extend or enter into a five- to seven-year contract that would require the customer to commit not to decrease its historical level of purchases through the competitor\u2019s GPO supplier contracts over the term of the contract and to agree to a reduction in the percentage of administrative fee revenue share paid by the competitor to such customer on an annual basis. The amount of stock given to each customer would be equal to the amount of the reduction in revenue share due to the customer over the term of the contract. The HHS Office of Inspector General concluded that the competitor\u2019s proposed transaction could potentially generate prohibited remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Statute and that the HHS Office of Inspector General could potentially impose administrative sanctions on the competitor in connection with the arrangement. The HHS Office of Inspector General first noted that the granting of stock to customers would not fit within the discount safe harbor and therefore must be assessed based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. The HHS Office of Inspector General then observed that when a GPO passes through administrative fees to its customers, such fees could be treated as discounts on the price of goods sold by the vendors and the GPO and its customers could meet the reporting and other requirements of the discount safe harbor. This in turn could reduce costs to federal healthcare programs. The HHS Office of Inspector General asserted that the competitor\u2019s proposed arrangement, to the contrary, would result in a portion of a customer\u2019s revenue share, which would otherwise be reflected as a reduction in expense on the customer\u2019s cost reports, being exchanged for stock which would have no potential to benefit payers, including federal healthcare programs. The HHS Office of Inspector General cited three additional factors which, in its view, increase the risk of fraud and abuse posed by the competitor\u2019s proposed transaction: (i) the customers receiving stock would be required to extend their contracts (or enter into new contracts) with the competitor\u2019s GPO for five to seven years; (ii) the stock granted by the competitor would be tied to the customers\u2019 past purchases; and (iii) customers would not be permitted to decrease their volume of purchases through the competitor\u2019s group purchasing contracts. In the HHS Office of Inspector General\u2019s view, the combination of these three factors would result in customers potentially being rewarded with stock based upon their past referrals and being locked into long-term contracts under which they would be forced to maintain historical purchasing levels for an extended period of time regardless of whether the competitor is getting them the best prices. We believe that the terms of the Reorganization are distinguishable from those described in Advisory Opinion 13-09 requested by our competitor. As discussed above, we periodically receive and respond to questions from government agencies on various matters and we responded to an informal request in July 2014 from the HHS Office of Inspector General to enumerate the factors that distinguish our Reorganization from the fact pattern in Advisory Opinion 13-09 and to discuss how the GPO Participation Agreements comply with the discount safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Statute. We have had no further correspondence or interaction, oral or written, with the HHS Office of Inspector General since that time. There is no safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Statute that is applicable to the Reorganization in its entirety across all of the agreements, and no assurance can be given that the HHS Office of Inspector General or other regulators or enforcement authorities will agree with our assessment. Any determination by a state or federal agency that the terms of our Reorganization or our relationship with our members violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or any other federal or state laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business, or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs, and, thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is also subject to numerous federal and state laws that forbid the submission or \u201ccausing the submission\u201d of false or fraudulent information or the failure to disclose information in connection with the submission and payment of claims for reimbursement to Medicare, Medicaid, other federal healthcare programs or private health plans. In particular, the False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits a person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval by an officer, employee or agent of the United States. In addition, the FCA prohibits a person from knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to such a claim. Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages, significant monetary penalties, and other collateral consequences including, potentially, exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. The scope and implications of the amendments to the FCA pursuant to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, or FERA, have yet to be fully determined or adjudicated and as a result it is difficult to predict how future enforcement initiatives may impact our business. If enforcement authorities find that we have violated the FCA, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pursuant to the 2010 healthcare reform legislation, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA.\nThese laws and regulations may change rapidly and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. Errors in claims submitted by our specialty pharmacies and pharmacy benefits management businesses, as well as errors created by our products or advisory services that relate to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim or cost report information by our members may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Any failure of our businesses or our products or services to comply with these laws and regulations, or the assertion that any of our relationships with suppliers or members violated the Anti-Kickback Statute and therefore caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims, could (i) result in substantial civil or criminal liability, (ii) adversely affect demand for our services, (iii) invalidate all or portions of some of our member contracts, (iv) require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, (v) require us to refund portions of our services fees, (vi) cause us to be disqualified from serving members doing business with government payers, and (vii) have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf current or future antitrust laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties, and other material limitations on our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect competition which, if enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The group purchasing industry has previously been under review by members of the U.S. Senate with respect to antitrust laws. In 2002, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights conducted a series of hearings concerning the activities of GPOs, including us. As a response to the Senate Subcommittee inquiry, we and other operators of GPOs formed the Healthcare Supply Chain Association (formerly the Healthcare Industry Group Purchasing Association), or HSCA, which developed a code of conduct to assure compliance with ethical and legal standards, including the antitrust laws. In addition, in 2002 we adopted our own Code of Conduct in consultation with a leading ethicist. As part of these Senate investigations, the U.S. General Accounting Office, or GAO, published two reports. The first report included an examination of GPO pricing. The second report investigated contracting practices used by GPOs with regard to administrative fees, sole source contracts and bundling arrangements and discussed the various codes of conduct implemented by the GPOs to address these practices.\nOn August 11, 2009, we and several other operators of GPOs received a letter from Senators Charles Grassley, Herb Kohl and Bill Nelson requesting information concerning the different relationships between and among us and our members, distributors, manufacturers and other suppliers, and requesting certain information about the services we perform and the payments we receive in connection with our GPO programs. On September 25, 2009, we and several other operators of GPOs received a request for information from the GAO, also concerning our services and relationships with our members in connection with our GPO programs. Subsequently, we and other operators of GPOs received follow-up requests for additional information. We fully complied with all of these requests. On September 27, 2010, the GAO released a report titled \u201cGroup Purchasing Organizations-Services Provided to Customers and Initiatives Regarding Their Business Practices.\u201d On that same day, the Minority Staff of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee released a report titled \u201cEmpirical Data Lacking to Support Claims of Savings with Group Purchasing Organizations.\u201d On March 30, 2012, the GAO released a report titled \u201cGroup Purchasing Organizations-Federal Oversight and Self-Regulation.\u201d In February, 2014, the GAO released a report examining the current situation regarding shortages of certain drugs and contributing factors to those shortages. Among the areas examined was the role of GPOs as a potential cause of the drug shortages. While the report cited some stakeholder perspectives and studies related to GPOs contributing to the cause of drug shortages, the report did not make any recommendations related to GPOs. In early 2014, we and four other GPOs received a survey from the GAO inquiring about purchasing volume, administrative fees and business activities. On November 24, 2014, the GAO released a report titled \"Funding Structure Has Potential Implications for Medicare Costs.\" No assurance can be given regarding any further inquiries or actions arising or resulting from the report or otherwise, or any related impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCongress, the DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the U.S. Senate or another state or federal entity could at any time open a new investigation of the group purchasing industry, or develop new rules, regulations or laws governing the industry, that could adversely impact our ability to negotiate pricing arrangements with suppliers, increase reporting and documentation requirements, or otherwise require us to modify our arrangements in a manner that adversely impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also face private or government lawsuits alleging violations arising from the concerns articulated by these governmental actors.\nDuring the past 15 years, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits brought by suppliers of medical products. Typically, these lawsuits have alleged the existence of a conspiracy among manufacturers of competing products and operators of GPOs, including us, to deny the plaintiff access to a market for its products. No such litigation is currently pending. No assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to similar actions in the future or that such matters will be resolved in a manner satisfactory to us or which will not harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that the antitrust laws will ultimately be enforced in a manner consistent with our interpretation. If we are found to be in violation of the antitrust laws we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential healthcare reform and new regulatory requirements placed on our software, services and content could impose increased costs on us, delay or prevent our introduction of new services types and impair the function or value of our existing service offerings.\nOur services may be significantly impacted by healthcare reform initiatives and could be subject to increasing regulatory requirements, either of which could affect our business in a multitude of ways. If additional substantive healthcare reform or applicable regulatory requirements are adopted, we may have to change or adapt our services and software to comply. Reform or changing regulatory requirements may also render our services obsolete or may block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new services. This may in turn impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment or to further develop services or software. Such reforms may also make introduction of new service offerings more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate. Such changes may even prevent introduction by us of new services or make the continuation of our existing services unprofitable or impossible.\nFederal and state privacy, security and breach notification laws may increase the costs of operation and expose us to civil and criminal government sanctions and third-party civil litigation.\nWe must comply with extensive federal and state requirements regarding the use, retention, security and re-disclosure of patient/beneficiary healthcare information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it, which we refer to collectively as HIPAA, contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, referred to as \u201cprotected health information.\u201d The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity or a business associate (essentially, a third party engaged to assist a covered entity with enumerated operational and/or compliance functions) from using or disclosing protected health information unless the use or disclosure is validly authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule and only if certain complex requirements are met. In addition to establishing these complex requirements, covered entities and business associates must also meet additional compliance obligations set forth in the Privacy Rule. In addition, the HIPAA Security Rule establishes administrative, organization, physical and technical safeguards to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by covered entities and business associates. The HIPAA Security Rule requirements are intended to mandate that covered entities and business associates regularly reassess the adequacy of their safeguards in light of changing and evolving security risks. Finally, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires that covered entities and business associates, under certain circumstances, notify patients/beneficiaries and HHS when there has been an improper use or disclosure of protected health information.\nOur specialty pharmacy, our self-funded health benefit plan, and our healthcare provider members (provided that these members engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions with health plans, which will be all or the vast majority) are directly regulated by HIPAA as \u201ccovered entities.\u201d From time to time, as part of our specialty pharmacy business, certain of our affiliates act as business associates of retail and other pharmacies in connection with co-branding initiatives. As such, we are subject to HIPAA and other risks discussed herein associated with being a business associate. Additionally, because most of our U.S. hospital members disclose protected health information to us so that we may use that information to provide certain data analytics, benchmarking, advisory or other operational and compliance services to these members, we are a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of those members. In these cases, in order to provide members with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA require us to enter into \u201cbusiness associate agreements\u201d with our covered entity members. Such agreements must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances:\n\u2022\nas to how we will use and disclose the protected health information within certain allowable parameters established by HIPAA,\n\u2022\nthat we will implement reasonable administrative, organizational, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse,\n\u2022\nthat we will enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information,\n\u2022\nthat we will report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information, and\n\u2022\nthat we will assist the covered entity with certain of its duties under HIPAA.\nWith the enactment of the HITECH Act, the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA were modified and expanded. The HITECH Act applies certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities. Prior to this change, business associates had contractual obligations to covered entities but were not subject to direct enforcement by the federal government. On January 17, 2013, HHS released final rules implementing the HITECH Act changes to HIPAA. These amendments expand the protection of protected health information by, among other things, imposing additional requirements on business associates, further restricting the disclosure of protected health information in certain cases when the disclosure is part of a remunerated transaction, and modifying the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, which has been in effect since September 2009, to create a rebuttable presumption that any improper use or disclosure of protected health information requires notice to affected patients/beneficiaries and HHS. The 2013 final rule became effective on March 26, 2013 and the compliance date for most provisions is September 23, 2013. The modifications to the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requirements are currently effective and being enforced.\nAny failure or perceived failure of our products or services to meet HIPAA standards and related regulatory requirements could expose us to certain notification, penalty and/or enforcement risks, could adversely affect demand for our products and services, and force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to modify our products or services to address the privacy and security requirements of our members and HIPAA.\nIn addition to our obligations under HIPAA there are other federal laws that impose specific privacy and security obligations, above and beyond HIPAA, for certain types of health information and impose additional sanctions and penalties. These rules are not preempted by HIPAA. Finally, most states have enacted patient and/or beneficiary confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, data security breach notification requirements, and special rules for so-called \u201csensitive\u201d health information, such as mental health, genetic testing results, or HIV status. These state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them as well.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other federal or state laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the associated costs of compliance. For example, the federal Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, or ONCHIT, is coordinating the development of national standards for creating an interoperable health information technology infrastructure based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the healthcare sector. We are yet unable to predict what, if any, impact the creation of such standards and the further developments at ONCHIT will have on the necessary specifications or demand for our products, services, or on associated compliance costs.\nFailure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection and data security may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and in some circumstances, criminal penalties. In addition, such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain members and attract new members.\nHIPAA also mandates format, data content and provider identifier standards that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. Although our systems are fully capable of transmitting transactions that comply with these requirements, some payers and healthcare clearinghouses with which we conduct business may interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do or may require us to use legacy formats or include legacy identifiers as they make the transition to full compliance. In cases where payers or healthcare clearinghouses require conformity with their interpretations or require us to accommodate legacy transactions or identifiers as a condition of successful transactions, we attempt to comply with their requirements, but may be subject to enforcement actions as a result. In January 2009, CMS published a final rule adopting updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. A separate final rule also published by CMS in January 2009 resulted in changes to the formats to be used for electronic transactions subject to the ICD-10 code sets, known as Version 5010. As of March 31, 2012, healthcare providers are required to comply with Version 5010. Use of the ICD-10 code sets is not mandated until October 1, 2015. We believe we have made the proper modifications in preparation for the implementation of ICD-10. However, we may not be successful in responding to these changes and any changes in response that we make to our\ntransactions and software may result in errors or otherwise negatively impact our service levels. We may also experience complications in supporting members that are not fully compliant with the revised requirements as of the applicable compliance date.\nOur group purchasing, specialty pharmacy and direct sourcing activities can be adversely affected by product safety concerns and regulation.\nMost of the products offered through our GPO supplier contracts, specialty pharmacies and direct sourcing activities are subject to direct regulation by federal and state governmental agencies. We rely upon suppliers who use our services to meet all safety and effectiveness, quality control, packaging, distribution, labeling, hazard and health information notice, record keeping and licensing requirements. In addition, we rely upon the carriers retained by our suppliers to comply with regulations regarding the shipment of any hazardous or perishable materials.\nWe cannot guarantee that the suppliers are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If suppliers or the providers with whom we do business have failed, or fail in the future, to adequately comply with relevant laws or regulations, we could become involved in governmental investigations or private lawsuits concerning these regulations. If we were found to be legally responsible in any way for such failure, we could be subject to injunctions, penalties or fines which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any such investigation or lawsuit could cause us to expend significant resources and divert the attention of our management team, regardless of the outcome, and thus could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Structure\nPremier, Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own, and it depends on distributions from Premier LP to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreements or pay any cash dividends, if declared, on our Class A common stock.\nPremier, Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own and it currently has no independent ability to generate revenue. Consequently, its ability to obtain operating funds currently depends upon distributions from Premier LP to Premier GP and from Premier GP to Premier, Inc. In accordance with the LP Agreement, subject to applicable law or regulation and the terms of Premier LP\u2019s financing agreements, Premier GP causes Premier LP to make quarterly distributions out of its estimated taxable net income to Premier GP and to the holders of Class B common units as a class in an aggregate amount equal to Premier LP\u2019s total taxable income for each such quarter multiplied by the effective combined federal, state and local income tax rate then payable by Premier, Inc. It is anticipated that these quarterly distributions will facilitate payment by each Premier LP partner of taxes, if required, on its share of taxable income of Premier LP. In addition, in accordance with the LP Agreement, Premier GP may cause Premier LP to make additional distributions to Premier GP and to the holders of Class B common units as a class in proportion to their respective number of units, subject to any applicable restrictions under Premier LP\u2019s financing agreements or applicable law. Premier GP distributes any amounts it receives from Premier LP to Premier, Inc., which Premier, Inc. uses to (i) pay applicable taxes, (ii) meet its obligations under the tax receivable agreements, and (iii) meet its obligations to the member owners under the Exchange Agreement if they elect to convert their Class B common units for shares of our Class A common stock and we elect to pay some or all of the consideration to such member owners in cash.\nIn addition, pursuant to the GPO participation agreements, Premier LP is contractually required to pay each member owner revenue share from Premier LP equal to 30% of all gross administrative fees collected by Premier LP based upon purchasing by such member owner\u2019s member facilities through our GPO supplier contracts. Additionally, our two largest regional GPO member owners, which represented approximately 16% of our gross administrative fee revenue for fiscal year 2015, each remit all gross administrative fees collected by such member owner based upon purchasing by such member owner\u2019s member facilities through the member owner\u2019s own GPO supplier contracts and receive revenue share from Premier LP equal to 30% of such gross administrative fees remitted to us. Finally, certain non-owner members have historically operated under, and following the completion of the Reorganization and our IPO, continue to operate under, contractual relationships that provide for a specific revenue share that differs from the 30% revenue share that we have been providing to our member owners under our current GPO participation agreements.\nTo the extent that Premier, Inc. needs funds, and Premier LP is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. The declaration and payment of future dividends by us, if at all, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our operating results and cash flow from Premier LP\u2019s operations, our strategic plans and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. In addition, Premier LP is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a partner to the extent that, at the time of\nthe distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of the limited partnership (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets.\nDifferent interests among our member owners or between our member owners and us, including with respect to related party transactions, could prevent us from achieving our business goals.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect that a majority of our board of directors will include directors and executive officers of our member owners and other directors who may have commercial relationships with our member owners. Certain of our member owners could have business interests that may conflict with those of the other member owners, which may make it difficult for us to pursue strategic initiatives that require consensus among our member owners.\nIn addition, our relationship with our member owners, who are both our members and own a significant percentage of our common stock and the units of Premier LP, could create conflicts of interest among the member owners, or between the member owners and us, in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. For example, certain of our products and services compete (or may compete in the future) with various products and services of our member owners. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise among the member owners based on certain allocations of net profits that the member owners may receive in proportion to their relative participation in our products and services. Except as set forth in the tax receivable agreements and the GPO participation agreements with the member owners and in the LP Agreement, there are not any formal dispute resolution procedures in place to resolve conflicts between us and a member owner or between member owners. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts between us and a member owner and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were negotiating with an unaffiliated party.\nOur ability to use the net proceeds from future issuances of our Class A common stock is limited.\nThe LP Agreement requires that we contribute to Premier LP the net proceeds received by us from any issuance of additional shares of our Class A common stock (other than exchanges under the Exchange Agreement) in exchange for newly issued Class A common units in Premier LP based on the fair market value of our Class A common stock at the time of the transfer. As a result, such proceeds will not be immediately available to us for our working capital requirements or other general corporate purposes.\nOur member owners are able to exercise significant control over us, including through the election of all of our directors.\nOur member owners beneficially own, in the aggregate, 100% of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock, giving them control of approximately 74% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of June 30, 2015. Our member owners may also own, from time to time, shares of our Class A common stock, thereby further increasing their aggregate voting power. Pursuant to the terms of a voting trust agreement (the \"Voting Trust Agreement\"), the trustee will vote all of the member owners\u2019 Class B common stock as a block in the manner determined by the plurality of the votes received by the trustee from the member owners for the election of directors to serve on our board of directors, and by a majority of the votes received by the trustee from the member owners for all other matters. As a result, our member owners have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs. In addition, our member owners will be able to determine the outcome of substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions even if such actions are not favored by our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, at June 30, 2015 our member owners owned 100% of our outstanding Class B common units, representing approximately 74% of the units of Premier LP. Because they hold their economic ownership interest in our business through Premier LP, rather than through Premier, Inc., due to the fact that shares of Class B common stock are not entitled to any economic rights, these member owners may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, many of our member owners are not-for-profit organizations which, as a result of their tax-exempt status, could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, and whether and when Premier should terminate the tax receivable agreements and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may be influenced by these member owners\u2019 tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us.\nOur member owners are able to exercise a greater degree of influence in the operation of our business and that of Premier LP and the management of our affairs and those of Premier LP than is typically available to stockholders of a publicly-traded company. Even if our member owners own a minority economic interest in Premier LP, they may be able to continue to exert significant\ninfluence over us and Premier LP through their ownership of our Class B common stock and the Voting Trust Agreement among the member owners and the trustee of Premier Trust.\nWe are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements because we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules. As a result, our stockholders do not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements, which may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nOur member owners, acting as a group pursuant to the terms of the Voting Trust Agreement, own more than 50% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock and we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NASDAQ corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are not be required by NASDAQ for continued listing of Class A common stock to (i) have a majority of independent directors, (ii) maintain an independent compensation committee or (iii) maintain an independent nominating function. We are taking advantage of all of these exemptions from NASDAQ listing requirements. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements and the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and affairs may be reduced. As a result, our status as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or could otherwise harm our Class A common stock price. Additionally, if our member owners reduce their ownership of our outstanding voting stock such that we no longer qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we will incur costs to recruit qualified independent directors to our board and to establish and maintain independent compensation and nominating and governance committees, which may reduce the amount of cash otherwise available to Premier LP for distributions, working capital or general corporate purposes.\nThe agreements between us and our member owners were made in the context of an affiliated relationship and may contain different terms than comparable agreements with unaffiliated third parties.\nThe contractual agreements that we have with each of our member owners were negotiated in the context of an affiliated relationship in which representatives of our member owners and their affiliates comprised a significant portion of our board of directors. As a result, the financial provisions and the other terms of these agreements, such as covenants, contractual obligations on our part and on the part of our member owners, and termination and default provisions may be less favorable to us than terms that we might have obtained in negotiations with unaffiliated third parties in similar circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny payments made under the tax receivable agreements with our member owners will reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Class B common units of Premier LP from the member owners in connection with our IPO, and any subsequent exchanges of Class B common units with us for shares of Class A common stock, we expect to become entitled to special tax benefits attributable to tax basis adjustments involving amounts generally equal to the difference between our purchase price for the acquired Class B common units (or, in the case of an exchange, the value of the shares of Class A common stock issued by us) and our share of the historic tax basis in Premier LP\u2019s tangible and intangible assets that is attributable to the acquired Class B common units. We entered into an agreement with each of our member owners in connection with our IPO, we must pay to the member owners 85% of the amount, if any, by which our tax payments to various tax authorities are reduced as a result of these special tax benefits. We are also obligated to make certain other payments on the occurrence of certain events that would terminate the agreement with respect to certain member owners. The tax basis adjustments, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any exchanges between us and the member owners, the amount and timing of our income and the amount and timing of the amortization and depreciation deductions and other tax benefits attributable to the tax basis adjustments.\nAs a result of our use of proceeds from our IPO and assuming that Premier is able to timely benefit from the anticipated tax benefits, we anticipated that the future aggregate amount of payments to be made by us under the tax receivable agreements to the member owners would be approximately $192.3 million, generally payable over the 15 years (under the current law) beginning in the year the income tax return is filed for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. As mentioned above, payments under the tax receivable agreements are made as Premier realizes tax benefits attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners in the Reorganization and subsequent quarterly exchanges between us and the member owners. The foregoing amount reflects payments with respect to the initial purchase of Class B common units. We paid $11.5 million to the member owners during the year ended June 30, 2015 in connection with the initial exchanges and reduced the liability by $2.0 million in connection with departed member owners. Additional amounts payable under the tax receivable agreements for subsequent exchanges of Class B common units made by the member owners during the year ended June 30, 2015 are $57.1 million, which resulted in $235.9 million in tax receivable agreement liabilities as of June 30, 2015. We expect to fund our payments under the tax receivable agreements from distributions we receive from Premier LP.\nThe tax receivable agreements provide that, in the event that we exercise our right to early termination of the tax receivable agreements, or in the event of a change in control or a material breach by us of our obligations under the tax receivable agreements, the tax receivable agreements will terminate, and we will be required to make a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the tax receivable agreements, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income. The change of control payment and termination payments to the member owners could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we receive as a result of acquiring Class B common units from the member owners because the amounts of such payments would be calculated assuming that we would have been able to use the potential tax benefits each year for the remainder of the amortization periods applicable to the basis increases, and that tax rates applicable to us would be the same as they were in the year of the termination.\nThe member owners will not reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the tax receivable agreements, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to the member owners will be netted against payments otherwise to be made, if any, after our determination of such excess. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments under the tax receivable agreements in excess of our cash tax savings, which could materially impair our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition of Class B common units from the limited partners.\nUnder tax receivable agreements (the \"Tax Receivable Agreements\") entered into with our member owners in connection with the IPO, we are entitled to retain 15% of the total tax savings we realize as a result of increases in tax basis created by the purchase of Class B common units, as well as any future exchanges of Class B common units for our Class A common stock, and as a result of certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements. Our ability to realize, and benefit from, these tax savings depends on a number of assumptions, including that we will earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which the deductions arising from any such basis increases and payments are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income were insufficient or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders\u2019 equity could be negatively affected.\nChanges to Premier LP\u2019s allocation methods may increase a tax-exempt limited partner\u2019s risk that some allocated income is unrelated business taxable income.\nThe LP Agreement provides for the allocation of retained income to the limited partners of Premier LP, in part, according to the number of units owned rather than relative participation of the limited partners. A member owner that is a tax-exempt limited partner of Premier LP whose relative Class B common unit ownership is high compared to its relative participation may conclude, based on an analysis of its own facts and circumstances, that it has more unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, subject to tax than it had reported in the past, or may be at increased risk that the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, will seek to increase the amount of income reported by the tax-exempt limited partner as UBTI. Further, the LP Agreement provides for the allocation of distributed income to be adjusted based on facts and circumstances as are determined appropriate by Premier GP. Such adjustments may also increase the amount of income reported by certain tax-exempt limited partners as UBTI. Any increase in UBTI may cause a limited partner to leave Premier LP, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPremier LP may issue additional limited partnership units without the consent of our Class A common stockholders, which could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nPremier LP may issue additional limited partnership units to third parties without the consent of our Class A common stockholders, which would reduce our ownership percentage in Premier LP and would have a dilutive effect on the amount of distributions made to us by Premier LP and, therefore, the amount of dividends, if any, we can make to our Class A common stockholders. Any newly admitted Premier LP limited partners will receive Class B common units in Premier LP and an equal amount of shares of our Class B common stock. They will also become parties to the Exchange Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Voting Trust Agreement and the Tax Receivable Agreements, on the same terms and conditions as the member owners. Any such issuances, or the perception of such issuances, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the LP Agreement and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the LP Agreement and provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms, which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control,\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive,\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates,\n\u2022\ndo not permit stockholders to take action by written consent other than during the period following our IPO in which we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules,\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of the board of directors, the chair of our board or the chief executive officer,\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees,\n\u2022\nrequire a super-majority vote of the stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation, and\n\u2022\nallow our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws but only allow stockholders to amend our bylaws upon the approval of 662/3% or more of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL which limits, subject to certain exceptions, the right of a corporation to engage in a business combination with a holder of 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting securities, or certain affiliated persons.\nThe Exchange Agreement contains rights of first refusal in favor of the other member owners and Premier LP in the event that a member owner desires to exchange its Class B common units for shares of our Class A common stock, cash or a combination of both. In addition, the Tax Receivable Agreements contain a change of control provision which, if triggered, would require us to make a one-time cash payment to the member owners equal to the present value of the payments that are forecasted to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements based on certain assumptions.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of us or Premier LP.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOur future issuance of common stock and/or preferred stock could dilute the voting power of our common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock.\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of shares of our Class A common stock and holders of shares of our Class B common stock, either by diluting the voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock if the preferred stock votes together with the common stock as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote, even if the action were approved by the holders of our shares of our Class A common stock and holders of shares of our Class B common stock.\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock by making an investment in the Class A common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the Class A common stock may not wish to purchase Class A common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase Class A common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of Class A common stock.\nIn addition, we could issue a significant number of shares of Class A common stock and/or Class B common stock in the future. Any of these issuances could dilute our existing stockholders, and such dilution could be significant. Moreover, such dilution could have a material adverse effect on the market price for the shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \"Exchange Act\"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, NASDAQ rules, including those promulgated in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations has and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we have and will continue to commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight. We have and will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. In addition, sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our organization and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe expect to incur significant additional annual expenses related to these steps associated with, among other things, director fees, reporting requirements, transfer agent fees, additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. We also expect that the rules and regulations to which we are subject as a result of being a public company will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage for such directors and officers. Any of these factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors. Finally, we expect to incur additional compliance costs now that we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or receive the benefits of such status.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company, and our relative inexperience could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders.\nOur IPO was completed in October 2013 and we have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our board of directors and senior management team have overall responsibility for our management and only a limited number of our directors or members of our senior management team have prior experience in operating a public company. As a publicly-traded company, we are required to develop, implement and maintain substantial control systems, policies and procedures in order to satisfy our periodic SEC reporting and NASDAQ obligations. We cannot assure you that management\u2019s past or limited current experience will be sufficient to successfully develop, implement and maintain these systems, policies and procedures and to operate our company. Failure to do so could jeopardize our status as a public company, and the loss of such status may materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. We no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, and thus, we are now subject to the auditors\u2019 attestation requirement. We are also required to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable NASDAQ requirements, among other items. Establishing these internal controls have been and will continue to be costly and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nEvaluation by us of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of NASDAQ listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our\ninternal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur relatively small public float in relation to that of other public companies may adversely impact the liquidity of our Class A common stock.\nPrior to our listing in October 2013, there was no public market for our Class A common stock. Our member owners control approximately 74% of the voting power of our common stock through their ownership of our Class B common stock, which is not publicly traded. As a result, our Class A common stock shares may be less liquid than the shares of other newly public companies or other public companies generally and there may be imbalances between supply and demand for our shares. As a result, our Class A common stock share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance. We cannot assure you that a regular trading market of our Class A common stock on NASDAQ or elsewhere will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of your ability to sell your Class A common stock when desired, or at all, or the prices that you may obtain for such Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish negative research or reports about us or our industry, or if any downgrade their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, our Class A common stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or our industry, our Class A common stock price may decline.\nOur stock price may be volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, if any, to holders of Class A common stock, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in or individual scandals, and in response the market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decrease significantly.\nIn the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe substantial number of shares of Class A common stock that will be eligible for sale or exchange in the near future could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to raise financing through the sale of equity securities in the future.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of Class A common stock or the availability of shares of Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock from time to time. At June 30, 2015, we had 37,668,870 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity securities more difficult. If we are unable to sell equity securities at times and prices that we deem appropriate, we may be unable to fund our future growth.\nAt June 30, 2015, there were 106,382,552 Class B common units of Premier LP outstanding. In connection with the Reorganization and IPO, Premier, Inc., Premier LP and the member owners entered into an Exchange Agreement which became effective upon the completion of the Reorganization and IPO. Under this agreement, subject to certain restrictions, commencing on October 31, 2014, and during each year thereafter, each member owner has the cumulative right to exchange up to one-seventh of the Premier LP Class B common units initially allocated to such member owner (or subsequently purchased by such member owner pursuant to the related right of first refusal set forth in the Exchange Agreement), for shares of our Class A common stock,\ncash or a combination of both, the form of consideration to be at the discretion of the audit committee of our board of directors, subject to certain restrictions. This exchange right can be exercised on a quarterly basis (subject to certain restrictions contained in the Registration Rights Agreement) and is subject to rights of first refusal in favor of the other holders of Class B common units and Premier LP. For each Class B common unit that is exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the member owner will also surrender one corresponding share of Class B common stock, which will automatically be retired. Any shares of Class A common stock issued as part of this exchange would be \u201crestricted securities,\u201d as defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act, or Rule 144. In connection with the Reorganization and our IPO, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\") with the member owners pursuant to which we registered under the Securities Act in November 2014 the resale of these shares of Class A common stock. On October 31, 2015, the second tranche of Class B common units, representing 15,901,130 units, become eligible for exchange. Including Class B common units eligible for exchange as of the date of this Annual Report, a cumulative amount of 26,572,413 Class B common units will be eligible for exchange on October 31, 2015.\nIn addition, we may issue and sell in the future additional shares of our Class A common stock, including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of the Class B common units outstanding from time to time, subject to certain contractual restrictions, including those restrictions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and restrictions under the Securities Act.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock, if any, may be your only source of gain on an investment in our Class A common stock.\nEven if we decide in the future to pay any dividends, Premier, Inc. is a holding company with no independent operations of its own, and depends on distributions from Premier LP to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements or pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock. Deterioration in the financial conditions, earnings or cash flow of Premier LP and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay cash distributions or other distributions to Premier, Inc. (indirectly through Premier GP). Premier LP and its subsidiaries may be restricted from distributing cash to Premier GP by, among other things, applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFuture issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to shares of our Class A common stock upon our liquidation, and future issuances of equity securities (including units of Premier LP), which would dilute the holders of shares of our existing Class A common stock and may be senior to shares of our Class A common stock for the purposes of making distributions, periodically or upon liquidation, may materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings. Upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and other loans and preferred shares will receive a distribution of our available assets before holders of shares of our Class A common stock. We are not required to offer any such additional debt or equity securities to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, additional issuances of our Class A common stock, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities (including Class B common units), warrants or options, will dilute the holders of shares of our existing Class A common stock and such issuances or the perception of such issuances may reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock. Our preferred shares, if issued, would likely have a preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could limit our ability to make distributions to holders of shares of our Class A common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or otherwise incur debt in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future capital raising efforts. Thus, holders of shares of our Class A common stock bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our other borrowings will reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock and dilute their ownership in us.", "PERMNO": 14169, "SIC": 5122, "TIC": "PINC"}
