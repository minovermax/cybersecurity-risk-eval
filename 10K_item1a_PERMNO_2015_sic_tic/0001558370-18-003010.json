{"cik": "1136294", "company": "GLOBAL POWER EQUIPMENT GROUP INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe may not generate sufficient cash resources to continue funding our operations.\nIn order to have sufficient cash to fund our continuing operations, we will need to successfully reduce corporate headquarters expenses to properly align with and support our business. If we are unsuccessful in this liquidity generating initiative and do not have sufficient cash resources to operate our business, we may need to raise additional debt capital or sell assets outside the normal course of business. Otherwise, we may be forced to significantly curtail or cease our operations or seek bankruptcy protection. For additional information, please refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 2- Liquidity\u201d and \u201cNote 10-Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe have incurred losses from operations in recent fiscal years, and may incur further losses in the future.\nWe incurred operating losses from continuing operations in 2017 and 2016 of $22.0 million and $18.0 million, respectively, and may incur further losses in the operation of our business. The corporate headquarters organization required to manage the complexities of three reporting segments, one of which had significant international operations, contributed to our losses. Additionally, in 2017 and 2016, we incurred $3.1 million and $6.7 million, respectively, of legal and accounting costs associated with the now completed restatement of certain prior financial results. With the completed disposal of the Mechanical Solutions segment and the anticipated disposal of the Electrical Solutions segment, we anticipate a significant reduction in corporate operating expenses in 2018 as a result of the more streamlined company structure. Despite these efforts, we may still fail to meet our goal of achieving and maintaining profitability in the future.\nIf we do not timely pay amounts due and comply with the covenants under our credit facility, our business, financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern would be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The terms of the Centre Lane Facility, among other things, require high interest payments, encumbrances on our assets, and subject us to restrictive covenants that significantly limit our operating flexibility. Additionally, the Centre Lane Facility requires mandatory prepayment of all the obligations due and payable thereunder on May 31, 2019.\nUpon a default under the Centre Lane Facility, our senior secured lenders would have the right to accelerate the then-outstanding amounts under such facility and to exercise their rights and remedies to collect such amounts, which would include foreclosing on collateral constituting substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries. Any default on the Centre Lane Facility could result in the outstanding principal balance under such facility becoming immediately due and payable. We do not currently have sufficient cash on hand to repay the balance, and a failure to do so would constitute a default. Accordingly, a default could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our lenders under the Centre Lane Facility exercise their rights and remedies to the extent permitted by such facility and applicable law, we would likely be forced to seek bankruptcy protection and our investors could lose the full value of their investment in our common stock. For additional information, please refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 2-Liquidity\u201d and \u201cNote 10-Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm may include an explanatory paragraph in its audit opinion that accompanies our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 indicating that our debt covenants and liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we are unable to pay amounts due under the Centre Lane Facility, fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants under the Centre Lane Facility or otherwise breach or fail to develop and implement plans sufficient to alleviate the adverse effects of the foregoing before the completion of the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, our independent registered public accounting firm may include an explanatory paragraph in its audit opinion that accompanies our 2018 financial statements, indicating that the terms of our indebtedness and related liquidity position raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe presence of any such explanatory paragraph may, among other negative effects, make it difficult for us to continue to negotiate acceptable payment terms with our vendors and customers or may result in one or more of our suppliers making demand for adequate assurance, which could include a demand for payment in advance. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable payment terms with our customers, or if any of our material suppliers were to successfully demand payment in advance, and we were unable to internally generate or externally raise cash in sufficient amounts to cover our resulting reduced liquidity, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and may force us to seek bankruptcy protection. Other effects of such an explanatory paragraph may include difficulty obtaining future financing and negative perceptions among our customers and investors.\nIf our independent registered public accounting firm fails to stand for reappointment, any resulting need to engage a new auditor could significantly delay the filing of our future annual and quarterly reports with the SEC and adversely impact our business.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm goes through client reacceptance procedures annually to determine if it is willing to stand for reappointment. These procedures include, among other items, a risk assessment. Due to our risk profile, there is a chance we will not meet the minimum criteria for reacceptance. If we are unable to satisfy the requirements of such client reacceptance criteria, we may be required to change auditors, which could significantly delay the filing of our 2018 annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K or 10-Q, as applicable, and subsequent reports with the SEC. Any such delay could result in a breach of the covenants of the Centre Lane Facility, reduce our trade credit based on our inability to deliver recent financial statements to our key vendors and cause us to become delinquent in our SEC filings.\nThe limitations and covenants contained in the Centre Lane Facility constrain our ability to borrow additional money, sell assets and make acquisitions, which may impair our ability to fully implement elements of our business strategy and otherwise adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Centre Lane Facility contains a number of limitations and covenants that limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7\nborrow money or make capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nmerge or sell assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nmake acquisitions or investments.\nThe Centre Lane Facility provides for variable rates of interest. We will be liable for the greatest amount of interest permitted under such rates. Any increase in the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may result in an increase in our interest rates on our outstanding debt and therefore negatively affect our cash flow and financial condition. Our obligations under the Centre Lane Facility are guaranteed by all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. Our obligations are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our assets and those of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. This includes 100% of the voting equity interests of our domestic subsidiaries and certain specified foreign subsidiaries and 65% of the voting equity interests of other directly owned foreign subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions.\nThe Centre Lane Facility also includes additional restrictive covenants, including covenants that require us to maintain certain leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios, beginning on September 30, 2019. These restrictions could adversely affect our business because they include, among other things, limitations on our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be beneficial for our business. These restrictions also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make capital expenditures and business acquisitions, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, accept certain business opportunities from customers or seek additional capital.\nIf we do not comply with the restrictive covenants, including failing to satisfy the required financial ratios, or obtain waivers as needed, our lenders could accelerate our debt and foreclose on our assets, and our shareholders may lose the full value of an investment in our common stock. Our ability to comply with the restrictive covenants in the Centre Lane Facility depends upon our ability to generate adequate earnings and operating cash flows or sell assets, which will be subject to our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as other general economic and competition conditions and\nfinancial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations, and we may continue to face significant liquidity constraints. For additional information, please refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and \u201cNote 2- Liquidity\u201d and \u201cNote 10-Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nAny inability to finance our business or repay the Centre Lane Facility, including due to deterioration of the credit markets, could adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to finance our existing operations and initiatives with existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash flows from operations, asset sales and the Centre Lane Facility. The Centre Lane Facility contains high interest rate payments, a number of restrictive covenants and other terms that limit our operating flexibility, including our ability to enter other investments or new lines of business. In addition, deterioration in the credit markets could adversely affect the ability of many of our customers to pay us on time and the ability of many of our suppliers to meet our needs on a competitive basis. Any inability to pay amounts due under the Centre Lane Facility or access necessary additional funds on acceptable terms or at all may negatively impact our business or operations.\nWe are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates.\nWe are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates. The Centre Lane Facility provides for variable rates of interest. We will be liable for the greatest amount of interest permitted under such rates. The LIBOR has risen in recent years and has continued to rise in 2018, and such increase may result in an increase in our interest rates on our outstanding debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nIf we become unable to obtain adequate surety bonding, it could reduce our ability to bid on new work, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects.\nIn line with industry practice, we are at times required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers. These bonds provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. If security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond on terms commercially acceptable to us, we may not be able to pursue that project. In addition, bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost. Our ability to obtain surety bonds is currently constrained, and any continued inability to obtain surety bonds on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and business prospects.\nWe are currently unable to obtain letters of credit, which could reduce our ability to bid on new work, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects.\nIn line with industry practice, we are at times required to provide letters of credit. These letters of credit provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. The Centre Lane Facility does not provide letters of credit. If security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a letter of credit on terms commercially acceptable to us, we may not be able to pursue that project. Any continued inability to obtain letters of credit on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and business prospects.\nWe have recorded write-downs of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets. If we were required to write-down additional amounts, our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment at least annually in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d). As a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2017 and 2016, we determined that our fair value exceeded its book value, and, accordingly, no impairment charge was necessary for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We had $47.9 million of goodwill and trade names remaining on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. If we experience declines in revenue and gross profit or do not meet our current and forecasted operating budget, we may be subject to goodwill and/or other intangible asset impairments in the future. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, and based on the magnitude of historical impairment charges, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. For additional information, please refer to \u201cNote 6-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nChanges to tax regulations, laws, accounting principles, future business operations or examinations by tax authorities may adversely impact our provision for income taxes and ability to use deferred tax assets.\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings differing materially from our projections, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, expiration of or lapses in tax credits, changes in ownership as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and outcomes as a result of tax examinations or changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles. As a result, our income tax provisions are also subject to volatility from these changes, as well as changes in accounting for uncertain tax positions, or interpretations thereof.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts.\nThe Tax Act (i) reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, (ii) generally will limit our annual deductions for interest expense to no more than 30% of our \u201cadjusted taxable income\u201d (plus 100% of our business interest income) for the year and (iii) will permit us to offset only 80% (rather than 100%) of our taxable income with any net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) we generate after 2017. Currently we do not expect the provisions of the Tax Act, taken as a whole, to have a material adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible in the future that the NOL and/or interest deductibility limitations could have the effect of causing us to incur income tax liability sooner than we otherwise would have incurred such liability or, in certain cases, could cause us to incur income tax liability that we might otherwise not have incurred, in the absence of these tax law changes.\nWe recorded a net reduction in valuation allowances related to continuing operations of $9.8 million and additional valuation allowances of $16.9 million on all U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Tax Act reduces the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for our tax years beginning in 2018, which resulted in the re-measurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances as of December 31, 2017 from 35% to the new 21% tax rate. A net reduction in valuation allowances of $9.8 million related to continuing operations was recorded against the gross deferred tax asset balances as of December 31, 2017 as a result of re-measurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in compliance with the Tax Act. These deferred tax assets remain available for use in future periods and will reduce our current tax expense in the year in which taxable income is generated to the extent that the deferred tax assets are not eliminated or limited under Code Sections 382 and 383.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in GAAP related to accounting for income taxes. In addition, GAAP applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which, if settled unfavorably, could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital. We could also be subject to examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There may be exposure that the outcomes from these examinations will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be subject to limitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have U.S. federal tax NOL, foreign tax credits and general business tax credit carryforwards of $184.4 million, $10.2 million and $0.4 million respectively. Generally, NOL, foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce or eliminate U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Section 382 of the Code limits a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to reduce tax liabilities if the corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change.\u201d For these purposes, an ownership change is deemed to occur if there has been a change of more than 50% in the ownership of shareholders owning 5% or greater of the value of a corporation\u2019s stock over a three year period. Code Section 383 applies the same limitations to foreign tax credit, general business credit and capital loss carryforwards after an ownership change.\nBased upon our review, we have not experienced an ownership change as defined under Code Section 382 as of December 31, 2017. If additional equity is issued in the future, an ownership change pursuant to Code Section 382 may occur. In addition, an ownership change under Code Section 382 could be caused by circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control,\nsuch as market purchases or sales by certain 5% or greater shareholders of our stock. There is also a risk that, due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, under the Tax Act, the amount of NOLs incurred after the end of the 2017 fiscal year that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. The Tax Act also generally eliminates the ability to carry back any NOLs to prior taxable years, while allowing post 2017 unused NOLs to be carried forward indefinitely. There is a risk that due to changes under the Tax Act, regulatory changes, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Thus, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change which would significantly limit the utilization of the Company\u2019s NOL, foreign tax credit or general business credit carryforwards in calculating future federal tax liabilities.\nRisk Factors Related to the Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements, delayed SEC Reporting and Our Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAudit, investigation, legal and expert services regarding the restatement and audit of our historical financial results, as well as recent legal proceedings, have required substantial attention from the Board of Directors, have diverted financial resources away from the Company and management\u2019s attention away from our usual business operations and may continue to adversely affect customer relationships and overall business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom mid-2015 until the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the \u201c2015 Report\u201d) in March 2017, which included the restatement of certain prior period financial results, our Board, Audit Committee and members of management devoted substantial internal and external resources to legal matters resulting from the restatement and remediation efforts and the preparation and filing of the 2015 Report. Due to the delays caused by the restatement, additional attention and resources were required during 2017 for the preparation and filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our 2016 fiscal year (the \u201c2016 Report\u201d), as well as our 2017 quarterly reports. As a result of these efforts, we have incurred significant incremental fees and expenses for additional audit services, financial and other consulting services and legal services, as well as the implementation and maintenance of systems and processes that will need to be updated, supplemented or replaced. These expenses, as well as the substantial time devoted by our Board and management toward identifying, addressing and remediating internal weaknesses and legal costs related to our internal investigation and the SEC investigation, pending litigation and other actions related to the restatement, had a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although our internal investigation and the SEC investigation have concluded, other legal actions relating to the restatement, as well as the remediation of weaknesses in our internal controls, continue to require management\u2019s attention. In addition, any future inquiries from legal proceedings or other actions by the SEC as a result of the restatement of our historical financial statements will, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our resources in addition to those resources already consumed in connection with the restatement itself and ongoing litigation matters. In addition, the restatement of our historical financial statements, the fact that our stock is not listed on a national securities exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange), and our significantly constrained liquidity have hindered our ability to attract new customers and strained relationships with certain existing customers, making it challenging to increase the volume and scope of our work.\nA pending putative securities class action and other legal matters could divert management\u2019s focus, result in substantial expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe matters that led to our internal investigation and the restatement of our historical financial results expose us to greater than typical risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. For instance, a putative shareholder class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with matters related to the restatement of our financial results. The third consolidated amended complaint filed by the lead plaintiff names the Company and three of our former officers as defendants. Please refer to \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and \u201cNote 14-Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuit, the magnitude of any potential losses or the effect such litigation may have on us or our operations. Regardless of the outcome, lawsuits and investigations involving us, or our current or former officers and directors, could result in significant expenses and divert attention and resources of our management and other key employees. We could be required to pay damages or other penalties or have injunctions or other equitable remedies imposed against us or our current or former directors and officers. In addition, we are generally obligated to indemnify our current and former directors and officers in connection with lawsuits, governmental investigations and related litigation or settlement amounts. Such amounts could exceed the coverage provided under our insurance policies. Any of these factors could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. In connection with our internal investigation and the restatement, we determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control environment and internal control activities. As of December 31, 2017, these material weaknesses continued to exist. We therefore concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Until we fully remediate these deficiencies, it may be more difficult for us to report results accurately and on time. While we are working to address the internal control over financial reporting and other issues raised by our restatement process, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. As of the date of this filing, the remediation process is ongoing. See \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nBecause of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur undetected, and it is possible that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Any failure of our internal controls could result in additional material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, significant deficiencies, material weaknesses, costs, failure to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations and further erosion of investor confidence. It would also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. If our internal controls continue to be deemed inadequate in the future, our current external auditors could resign, and the process of retaining new auditors could limit our access to capital for an extended period of time.\nOur failure to implement new accounting standards during the required time periods could result in our inability to file future periodic reports in a timely manner and lead to additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, beyond those disclosed in this report.\nThe FASB has issued new accounting guidance on revenue recognition that will change both the way revenue is accounted for and disclosed and will result in changes in internal controls. These changes in internal controls will reach beyond finance and accounting and will have an impact on other areas of our business, such as information technology and operations. Due to the delay in filing our 2015 Report, our 2016 Report and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of our 2017 fiscal year, we did not begin to assess the standard and its impact on our financial statement reporting and operations until the fourth quarter of 2017. We are still evaluating the impact of the adoption and are currently working with a third-party consultant to implement the necessary processes and procedures to comply with the new disclosure requirements.\nOur business operations depend upon our new senior management team and the ability of our other employees to successfully perform their roles.\nWe have experienced significant turnover in our senior management in recent years. In March 2015, we announced the departure of our former President and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) and the appointment of Terence J. Cryan as our new President and CEO. In September 2015, we announced the departure of our former Chief Financial Officer and the appointment of Craig E. Holmes as Senior Vice President of Finance. In March 2017, we announced the retirement of Timothy M. Howsman, who served as our Principal Financial Officer, the subsequent appointment of Mr. Holmes as the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial Officer and the appointment of Mark F. Jolly, who had been serving as Vice President, Finance, as the Company\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer and Principal Accounting Officer. In July 2017, we announced the resignation of Mr. Cryan as our President and CEO and the appointment of Mr. Holmes and Tracy D. Pagliara, formerly our Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, as Co-Presidents and Co-CEOs. Charles E. Wheelock was simultaneously appointed Vice President, Administration, General Counsel and Secretary. In August 2017, we announced the cessation of Mr. Jolly\u2019s employment as our Chief Accounting Officer and Principal Accounting Officer and the appointment of Erin Gonzalez as our Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer. On December 11, 2017, Mr. Howsman was rehired as Chief Accounting Officer. On April 13, 2018, Mr. Holmes resigned from his positions as Co-President and Co-CEO and director, and Mr. Pagliara became our President and CEO.\nWe have made significant changes to our business in a short interval of time, which can be disruptive to our employees and business, and may add to the risk of control failures, including a failure in the effective operation of our internal controls over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures. Changes to company strategy can create uncertainty, may negatively impact our ability to execute quickly and effectively, and may ultimately be unsuccessful.\nAs new employees gain experience in their roles, we could experience inefficiencies or a lack of business continuity due to loss of historical knowledge and a lack of familiarity of those employees with business processes, operating requirements, policies and procedures (some of which are new) and key information technologies and related infrastructure used in our day-to-day operations and financial reporting. It is important to our success that these key employees quickly adapt to, and excel in, their new roles. Their failure to do so could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs that could adversely impact our results of operations, our stock price and our customer relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. In addition, if we were to lose the services of any one or more key employees, whether due to death, disability or termination of employment, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, financial plans and other objectives could be significantly impaired. Any of the above factors could also impede our ability to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal controls. See \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d If we do not effectively manage our business through our management transitions, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of our inability to prepare and timely file periodic reports, we face limitations in our ability to issue securities and engage in certain transactions, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are required to comply with Section 13 of the Exchange Act. We did not file any Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or any Annual Report on Form 10-K from the May 2015 announcement of our intention to restate our financial results until March 15, 2017, when we filed the 2015 Report that included restated prior period financial statements and our 2015 financial information. We also did not file any Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for fiscal 2016 until we filed the 2016 Report on September 12, 2017. Although we have completed the filings of our past due reports with the SEC, we will not be eligible to use \u201cshort form\u201d registration statements that would allow us to incorporate by reference our SEC reports into our registration statements, or to use \u201cshelf\u201d registration statements, until we have filed all of our periodic reports in a timely manner for a period of 12 months. As a result of becoming current in our SEC filing obligations, we may use Form S-1 to register a sale of our stock to raise capital; however, the inability to use the \u201cshort form\u201d registration statement would likely increase transaction costs and be time consuming, which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital in a timely manner. While we were not current in our SEC reporting obligations, we were unable to use our existing registration statement on Form S-8 or file a new registration statement on Form S-8, which could have been used to register the issuance and sales of securities under our equity incentive plans. As a result, our ability to grant awards to adequately incentivize and retain skilled employees, including key employees needed to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses in our internal controls, was, and could continue to be adversely affected. See \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d In addition, if we fail to remain current in our SEC filing obligations, our ability to solicit shareholder consent for certain potential capital-raising transactions may be impacted. These restrictions could increase the costs of selling securities publicly, significantly delay such sales or transactions and adversely affect our business.\nWe have not held an annual meeting of our shareholders since May 2015. As a result, our shareholders have not had the opportunity to elect directors since May 2015, and we cannot assure investors when such an opportunity will arise.\nOur bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law state that we must hold an annual meeting of our shareholders for the election of directors and other business as may be properly brought before the meeting. However, because of our delayed periodic report filings, we have not held an annual meeting of our shareholders since May 2015. Therefore, our shareholders have not had the opportunity to vote in an election of our directors since that time and, under Delaware law, our shareholders have the right to demand that we hold such a meeting. We recently received such a demand from one of our shareholders and, as previously disclosed, we plan to hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting. However, if we fail to hold annual shareholders\u2019 meetings in the future, it would be more challenging for our shareholders to vote on the election of our directors.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Operations\nA substantial portion of our revenue is related to services performed at nuclear power plants, and reduced investment in, or increased regulation related to, nuclear power plants would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThe demand for the services we provide at nuclear power plants is directly tied to the number of nuclear power facilities that utilize our services. Additionally, U.S. nuclear capacity and electricity generation are expected to decline due to continuing low natural gas prices and the rapid expansion of low cost renewable energy and new technologies in the U.S., displacing more traditional sources of power, including nuclear power. Public support for nuclear power has also softened because of pricing, environmental and safety concerns. Declining demand for U.S. nuclear power generation and related construction and maintenance budgets would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and cash flow.\nThere are two new nuclear reactors at one U.S. site under construction, and several nuclear reactors are undergoing decommissioning. Pricing pressure has resulted in a decrease in the maintenance budgets for existing nuclear plants. Other new construction projects were reevaluated and discontinued in 2017. For example, during 2017, the owners of V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 abandoned the project.\nIn addition, decreases in state and federal government subsidies and increased regulation would also negatively impact the demand for nuclear power and the services we provide. For instance, the NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose safety-related and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, and events at nuclear facilities or other events impacting the industry generally could lead to additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities and could negatively impact the demand for nuclear power and the services we provide.\nIf our costs exceed the estimates we use to set the fixed-prices of our contracts, our earnings will be reduced.\nFixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, erroneous or incomplete cost estimates, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period.\nIn addition, we have a limited ability to recover any cost overruns. Contract prices are established based in part on our projected costs, which are subject to a number of assumptions. The costs that we incur in connection with each contract can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections. Because of the large scale and complexity of our contracts, unanticipated changes may occur, such as customer budget decisions, design changes, delays in receiving permits and cost increases. Unanticipated cost increases or delays may occur as a result of several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nincreases in the cost of commodities, labor or freight;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated technical problems;\n\u00b7\nproblems related to successfully managing contract performance;\n\u00b7\nsuppliers\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 failure to perform, requiring modified execution plans or re-work; and\n\u00b7\ndecreases in labor efficiency realized.\nWe often are contractually subject to liquidated damages in the event that we fail to perform our obligations in a timely manner. Such damages can be significant and may have a negative impact on our profit margins and financial results.\nCost increases or overruns that we cannot pass on to our customers or our payment of liquidated damages or other penalties under our contracts will lower our earnings. In addition, increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our gross margins.\nIf we are unable to control the delivery of services provided because of internal operational issues or poor subcontractor performances, our reputation could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers. In the event of subcontractor insolvency, if we are unable to recover any advance progress payments made to subcontractors, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on subcontractors to perform services on various projects for scopes of work that are outside of our current service offerings. Our subcontractors do not account for a significant percentage of our service costs. The quality and performance of our subcontractors are not entirely under our control. Our subcontractors may not always meet the requisite level of quality control or our delivery schedules. The failure of our subcontractors to perform quality services in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in the cancellation of orders for our services, significant warranty and repair costs and the loss of customers. In addition, our contracts with customers may contain liquidated damages, and triggering such provisions could result in significant financial penalties, or, even if not triggered, could affect our ability to recognize revenue in a given period.\nOther potential consequences of the failure of our subcontractors to meet our standards include a potential need to change subcontractors, resulting in increased costs. At times, we make advance progress payments to subcontractors in anticipation of completion of services, and we may be unable to recover those advances if a subcontractor fails to complete the scope of work. The occurrence of any of the above may adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters, including hurricanes, and other severe catastrophic events, such as acts of war and terrorism, and any disruption to our business resulting from such events will adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe catastrophic events. Any disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and provide services to our customers, and the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other catastrophic events.\nMost recently, our discontinued operations were impacted by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The severe weather conditions directly affected production, which was largely shut down for nearly one week. Although work resumed, the hurricane resulted in significant production delays, and we are currently assessing the impact this will have on our contractual obligations to certain customers. Should the impact result in delivery delays, this could result in liquidated damages to be assessed or the potential loss of customers. In addition, many of our employees were displaced by the hurricane or have departed to assist with the hurricane recovery efforts.\nWe may declare the existence of a force majeure event under our contracts with certain customers, but we could incur liabilities for failure to meet the requirements of those agreements, especially if the counterparties dispute our invocation of the force majeure provisions of those agreements.\nThese and any future disruptions to our operations, including acts of war, terrorism or other force majeure, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive. Some of our competitors and potential competitors are less leveraged than we are, have greater financial or other resources than we have and may be better able to withstand adverse market conditions within the industry. Our competitors typically compete aggressively on the basis of pricing, and such competition may continue to impact our ability to attract and retain customers or maintain the rates we charge. To the extent that we choose to match our competitors\u2019 prices, it would result in lower margins and, as a result, could harm our results of operations. Should we choose not to match, or remain within a reasonable competitive distance from, our competitors\u2019 pricing, our sales volume would likely decrease, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in our markets that may be adopted by our competitors. However, any such developments would likely require additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A failure to keep pace with our competitors or the technological innovations in the markets we serve could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur future revenue and operating results may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period.\nOur quarterly and annual revenue and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future. Our service contracts contain customer-specific commercial terms that, coupled with other factors beyond our control, may result in uneven recognition of revenue and earnings over time. Customer-imposed delays can significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition and lengthen our cash conversion cycle. Due to our relatively large average contract size, our volume during any given period may be concentrated to relatively few contracts, intensifying the magnitude of these fluctuations. Furthermore, some of our operating costs are fixed. As a result, we may have limited ability to reduce our operating costs in response to unanticipated decreases in our revenue or the demand for our services in any given reporting period. Therefore, our operating results in any reporting period may not be indicative of our future performance. Because we must make significant estimates related to potential costs when we recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis, these costs may change significantly from reporting period to reporting period based on new project information.\nA small number of major customers account for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any of these customers could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. In 2017, three customers accounted for 59% of our consolidated revenue. In 2016, three customers accounted for 56% of our consolidated revenue. For a listing of our major customers, please refer to \u201cNote 15-Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. Because our major customers represent a large part of our business, the loss of any of our major customers could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Our business volume\nwith each of our largest customers is highly dependent on operations and maintenance budgets for U.S. utilities. Fluctuations in any of these factors could materially adversely impact our performance results.\nWe are subject to potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties, including our customers and suppliers.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods, or who purchase services from us, will be unable to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress. If such third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us, we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us, or we may have to write off receivables in the case of a customer failing to pay.\nIf a customer becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover accounts receivable from that customer would be adversely affected and any payment we received during the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially recoverable by the bankruptcy estate. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nIn March 2017, Westinghouse Electric Company, a subsidiary of Toshiba Corporation (\u201cWestinghouse\u201d), filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As of December 31, 2017, our accounts receivable from Westinghouse was $2.1 million, net of a $0.2 million reserve. As of the bankruptcy filing date, we had $8.7 million of accounts receivable from Westinghouse, of which $6.4 million has been collected. Westinghouse has stated that it intends to continue normal business operations. However, a number of uncertainties surround the Westinghouse Chapter 11 proceedings. Although the owner of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which were impacted by the Westinghouse bankruptcy, has decided to continue construction of such project and has received approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission, we would be adversely affected if the owner changes that decision in the future.\nThe dollar amount of our backlog, as stated at any time, is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.\nOur backlog consists of firm orders or blanket authorizations from our customers. Backlog may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period due to the timing of customer commitments. The time between receipt of an order and actual completion of services can vary. However, backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by our customers. To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be affected. If a customer cancels an order, we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. Typically, however, we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog contracts in the event of cancellation. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Furthermore, a portion of our backlog for multi-year service maintenance contracts is based on what we expect to perform in the next twelve months and is therefore not necessarily supported by a firm purchase order. If that work does not materialize, then our backlog would be negatively impacted, as that work would be considered a \u201ccancellation.\u201d Revenue recognition occurs over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays. Fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period that may be included in our backlog. Because of these large orders, our backlog in that reporting period may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent reporting periods. Our backlog, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue or of long-term industry trends.\nOur success is partially dependent upon maintaining our safety record, and an injury to or death of any of our employees, customers or vendors could result in material liabilities to our company.\nThe activities we conduct at our customers\u2019 facilities present a risk of injury or death to our employees, customers or visitors, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with safety regulations. We may be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury or death, and our workers\u2019 compensation and other insurance policies may not be adequate or may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us. In addition, our ability to obtain new business and retain our current business is partially dependent on our continuing ability to maintain a safety record that exceeds the industry average. If we fail to maintain superior safety performance, or if serious accidents occur in spite of our safety procedures, our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in our credit profile and market conditions can affect our relationships with suppliers, vendors and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on third-party suppliers and vendors to obtain necessary materials, and on subcontractors to perform certain services. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier, vendor or subcontractor, any substantial\nlimitation on the availability of or deterioration in our relationship with required suppliers or subcontractors would negatively impact our operations.\nChanges in our credit profile can affect the way such third parties view our ability to make payments and may induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices or require credit enhancement. For instance, as a result of delays in our payments, certain suppliers and subcontractors have imposed less favorable payment terms on us, including requirements to provide them with additional security in the form of prepayments, surety bonds or letters of credit. The imposition of burdensome payment terms or collateral requirements could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to other parties. This in turn could cause us to be unable to operate our business at the desired service levels, which might adversely affect our profitability and cash flow. In other cases, our relationships with certain third parties have been terminated, requiring us to rely on new firms for certain services, which may cost more and be of inferior quality.\nIn addition, changes in market and economic conditions could increase the risk of a lack of available suppliers or subcontractors. If any supplier or subcontractor upon which we rely is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations under present or future agreements with us, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain necessary services and may suffer an interruption in our ability to provide our services to customers.\nTo the extent we cannot engage quality subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials on acceptable terms, we would not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nA former operating unit has been named as a defendant in asbestos personal injury lawsuits.\nAs discussed in \u201cNote 14-Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, one of our former operating units has been named as a defendant in a limited number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits. Neither we, nor our predecessors, ever mined, manufactured, produced or distributed asbestos fiber, the material that allegedly caused the injury underlying these actions. The bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge order issued upon our emergence from bankruptcy in 2008 extinguished the claims made by all plaintiffs who had filed asbestos claims against us before that time. We believe the bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge order should serve as a bar against any later claim filed against us, including any of our subsidiaries, based on alleged injury from asbestos at any time before our emergence from bankruptcy. In all of the asbestos cases finalized post-bankruptcy, we have been successful in having such claims dismissed without liability. Moreover, during 2012, we secured insurance coverage that will help to reimburse the defense costs and potential indemnity obligations of our former operating unit relating to these claims. Nonetheless, findings of liability on our part in any of these cases that were filed against us after we emerged from bankruptcy that remain unresolved could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nCompliance with environmental, health, safety and other related laws and regulations is costly, and our ongoing operations may expose us to related liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to the protection of the environment or human health and safety. We are subject to various U.S. federal statutes and the regulations implementing them, as well as similar laws and regulations at the state and local levels. If we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations, we may be subject to significant liabilities for fines, penalties or damages, or lose or be denied significant operating permits.\nIn addition, we may be subject to liability allegations involving claims of personal injury or property damage. The operation of complex, large-scale equipment used in a variety of locations and climates and integration of a variety of purchased components entails an inherent risk of disputes and liabilities related to the operation of the equipment and the health and safety of the workers who operate and come into contact with the machinery. Because our services are primarily provided in power plants, claims could arise in different contexts, including fires, explosions and power surges, which can result in significant property damage or personal injury, and equipment failure, which can result in personal injury or damage to other equipment in the power plant.\nThe insurance policies we maintain to cover claims of this nature are subject to deductibles and recovery limitations, as well as limitations on contingencies covered, and we may, therefore, suffer losses from these claims for which no insurance recovery is available. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe effects of providing warranties for our services could result in unanticipated costs and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe generally provide warranties for terms of two years or less on our services. These warranties require us to re-perform services previously provided, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nExpiration of the Price-Anderson Act\u2019s indemnification authority could have adverse consequences for us.\nWe provide services to the nuclear industry. The Price-Anderson Act promotes the nuclear industry by offering broad indemnification to commercial nuclear power plant operators and the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) for liabilities arising out of nuclear incidents at power plants licensed by the NRC and at DOE nuclear facilities. That indemnification protects not only the NRC licensee or DOE prime contractor, but also others like us who may be doing work under contract or subcontract for a licensed power plant or under a DOE prime contract. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the period of coverage to include all nuclear power reactors issued construction permits through December 31, 2025. If the Price-Anderson Act\u2019s indemnification authority expires, a problem related to our provision of services at a nuclear facility could lead to a damage claim against us for which we might not be entitled to indemnification. In addition, any well-publicized problem with those services, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our reputation and reduce demand for our services.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, skilled workers and key officers could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified professional and/or skilled personnel in accordance with our needs, either through direct hiring, subcontracting or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals, is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for these professionals is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed personnel. Our ability to successfully execute our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified, experienced mechanical, design, structural and software engineers, service technicians and marketing and sales personnel. Demand for these workers can, at times, be high and the supply extremely limited. Our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers, and we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers.\nThe restatement of our historical financial results and poor financial performance has caused significant employee turnover and made it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain qualified personnel, the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled, which may require that we devote time and resources to identifying, hiring and integrating new employees. In addition, the failure to attract and retain key employees, including officers, could impair our ability to sustain or expand our operations, provide services to our customers and conduct our business effectively.\nDemand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic slowdowns and reductions in private industry and government spending. In times of general economic contraction, our revenue, profits and financial condition may be adversely affected and will not necessarily rise in tandem with general economic expansion.\nThe industries we serve historically have been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general slowdowns in the U.S. economy. Consequently, our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate depending on the level of demand for services from these industries.\nOur bookings and revenue may rise or fall sharply as total industry orders tend to follow pronounced cycles of general expansion and contraction. During a contraction phase, limited investment in new projects, deferrals of planned projects and project cancellations may significantly reduce our potential recognition of revenue and profits. At the end of an expansion phase, any existence of excess capacity will negatively affect power prices, which will result in a reduction in new orders. In addition to being cyclical in nature, our revenue does not correlate precisely with changes in actual or forecasted new capacity due to timing differences in revenue recognition.\nDuring periods of declining demand for power, many of our customers may face budget shortfalls or may delay capital expenditures, which could result in a decrease in the overall demand for our services. Our customers may find it more difficult to obtain project financing due to limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the global credit markets. In addition, our customers may demand better pricing terms and their ability to timely pay our invoices may be affected in times of economic slowdown. Any such reduction in private industry or government spending could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, net income or overall financial condition.\nInformation technology vulnerabilities and cyberattacks on our networks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely upon information technology to manage and conduct business, both internally and with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data, including, in certain instances, customer and supplier business information. Accordingly, maintaining the security of our computers and other electronic devices, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks and respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impacts. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and perpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, so we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of our information technology systems and security measures as a result of third party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier and other third party liabilities. Any damage, security breach, delay or loss of critical data associated with our systems may delay or prevent certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional significant resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nOur failure to comply with applicable governmental privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. could substantially impact our business, operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive and evolving federal and state privacy laws and regulations. Changes in privacy and data security laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations could have a negative effect on our operating methods and costs. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in the termination or loss of contracts, the imposition of contractual damages, private and government civil litigation, civil sanctions, damage to our reputation or, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, business and prospects. Determining compliance with such regulations is complicated by the fact that many of these laws and regulations have not been fully interpreted by governing regulatory authorities or the courts, and many of the provisions of such laws and regulations are open to a range of interpretations. There can be no assurance that we are, or have been, in compliance with all applicable existing laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with new laws or regulations.\nOur participation in multiemployer pension plans could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations.\nDuring 2017, we contributed to approximately 65 multiemployer pension plans throughout the U.S. and, historically, we have contributed to over 150 multiemployer pension plans in which we still have withdrawal liabilities. We believe that our responsibility for potential withdrawal liabilities associated with participating in multiemployer pension plans is limited because the building and construction trades exemption pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 should apply to the substantial majority of our plan contributions. However, pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and other applicable laws, we are exposed to other potential liabilities associated with plans that are underfunded. As of December 31, 2017, we had been notified that certain pension plans were in critical funding status. Currently, certain plans are developing, or have developed, a rehabilitation plan that may call for a reduction in participant benefits or an increase in future employer contributions. Therefore, in the future, we could be responsible for potential surcharges, excise taxes and/or additional contributions related to these plans, which could impact our liquidity and results of operations. While we continue to actively monitor, assess and take steps to limit our potential exposure to any surcharges, excise taxes, additional contributions and/or withdrawal liabilities, any market conditions or the number of participating employers remaining in each plan may result in a reorganization, insolvency or mass withdrawal that could have a material adverse effect on the funded status of the multiemployer plans and our potential withdrawal liability.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws in the U.S. Failure to comply with these laws could result in our becoming subject to penalties and the disruption of our business activities.\nThe U.S. has laws that restrict the offer or payment of anything of value to government officials or other persons with the intent of gaining business or favorable government action, and we are subject to such laws. In addition to prohibiting certain bribery-related activity with U.S. officials and other persons, these laws provide for recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Any failure by us, our subcontractors, agents or others who work for us on our behalf to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties. The failure to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could also result in the disruption of our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe Tax Act, or other changes in U.S. tax laws or regulations, or their interpretation, could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. As a result of enactment of the Tax Act, we are required to re-evaluate our U.S.-related deferred tax assets and liabilities and to account for a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act introduces significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments to be made in interpreting its provisions. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in the financial statements for fiscal year 2017. These provisional amounts are based on our initial analysis of the Tax Act. Anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the Tax Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) related to the Tax Act, may result in adjustments to these estimates which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nWork disruptions resulting from the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements or otherwise could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our operating performance.\nThe majority of our temporary craft employees are represented by labor unions with which we have collective bargaining agreements. There can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disruptions associated with a lengthy strike or the expiration or renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements or other work stoppage at our facilities or customer locations, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile, and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid.\nThe market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly and may be affected by numerous factors (some of which are beyond our control), including:\n\u00b7\nThe risk factors described in this Item 1A;\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws or regulations and court rulings and trends in our industry;\n\u00b7\nThe significant concentration of ownership of our common stock in the hands of a small number of investors;\n\u00b7\nChanges in supply and demand of components and materials;\n\u00b7\nChanges in tax or accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u00b7\nA shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nChanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry;\n\u00b7\nGeneral conditions in our customers\u2019 industries; and\n\u00b7\nThe degree of trading liquidity in our common stock and general market conditions.\nFrom December 31, 2012 to April 9, 2018, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $20.86 to $1.62 per share. Continued declines in the price of our common stock could impede our ability to obtain additional capital, attract and retain qualified employees and reduce the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the reduced stock price also increases the cost to us, in terms of dilution, of using our equity for employee compensation.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of similarly situated companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are currently subject to securities class action lawsuits filed against us. If additional suits were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could also negatively impact the market price of our stock.\nDelisting of our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and subsequent quotation on the OTC Pink\u00ae Marketplace-Limited Information Tier (\u201cOTC\u201d) operated by the OTC Markets Group Inc. may continue to decrease the value of our common stock and prevent certain investors from investing or achieving a meaningful degree of liquidity.\nOn March 30, 2016, we announced that we expected the NYSE to initiate procedures to delist our common stock, including the issuance of a delisting notice, and that we planned to disclose the receipt of such notice in a subsequent Current Report on Form 8-K. We subsequently received that notice, and the NYSE suspended trading in our common stock, effective March 30, 2016, and our common stock was subsequently delisted. As a result, our common stock is now quoted on the OTC. We cannot assure investors that our common stock will be listed on a national exchange such as the Nasdaq Stock Market, the NYSE or another securities exchange once we become current in our filing obligations with the SEC.\nBased upon the fact that our common stock is no longer registered for trading on a national exchange and that the value of our issued and outstanding common stock has decreased in value, there may be investment loss for stockholders or certain stockholders may no longer be permitted to invest in our common stock. Bid quotations on the OTC can be sporadic and may not provide any meaningful liquidity to investors. An investor may find it difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. As a result of these limitations, our common stock has fewer market makers, lower trading volumes and larger spreads between bid and asked prices than securities listed on a national stock exchange or automated quotation system would typically have.\nBecause there may be a limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock, the share price of our common stock is more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the market\u2019s perception of our business and announcements made by us, our competitors or parties with whom we have business relationships. There may also be fewer institutional investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes or to otherwise arrange for any financing that we may need in the future.\nWe are also no longer subject to the NYSE\u2019s rules, such as corporate governance requirements or the minimum market capitalization and stockholders\u2019 equity criteria. Without required compliance with such standards, investor interest in our common stock may decrease. The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE may also result in other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence by customers, strategic partners and employees and the loss of investor and media interest in us and our common stock.\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, so investors may not receive any return on investment unless investors sell their shares of common stock for a price greater than that which investors paid for them.\nOn May 30, 2012, our Board adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock; however, we have not paid any dividends since March 2015. The costs associated with the restatement of our historical financial results, as well as related matters, has presented a significant financial burden on our company, and the continued operation of our business has required substantial funding. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, the Centre Lane Facility prohibits us from paying dividends. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nAny future determination with respect to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions, terms of financing arrangements and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. Future dividends, their timing and amount will be subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all of our respective laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for organic initiatives and strategic transactions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; limitations in the Centre Lane Facility; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will declare dividends of any particular amounts or at all. If we do not pay dividends, then our common stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will occur only if our stock price increases, and such appreciation may not occur.\nActions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly, and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nActivist investors may attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and how our business is governed, or to acquire control over us to increase short-term stockholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. In fact, in June 2016, we entered into an election and nomination agreement with certain of our significant stockholders that had filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect to the Company. Pursuant to that agreement, we agreed to appoint two additional directors to our Board, one of whom would serve as a representative of those investors. Among other things, we also agreed to various standstill provisions and to include the investors\u2019 designees in our slate of nominees for election as directors at our next two annual meetings of stockholders. The agreement also provides that, because the Company did not hold its 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the significant stockholders have the right to terminate the agreement at any time after January 1, 2017.\nWhile we welcome varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock and any of our other efforts to raise additional capital may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, either by us, a member of management or a major stockholder, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity and debt offerings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, investor ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect investor rights as a stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any of the above could cause a decline in our stock price.", "PERMNO": 88987, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "WLMS"}
