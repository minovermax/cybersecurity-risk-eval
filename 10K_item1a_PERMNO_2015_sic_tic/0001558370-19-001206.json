{"cik": "745308", "company": "ST JOE CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect our business. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Current Business Strategy\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and financial performance.\nOur cash, investments - debt securities and investments - equity securities comprise approximately 27.6% of the carrying value of our assets, while our assets related to our existing investments in real estate comprise approximately 40.3% of the carrying value of our assets. Our future financial performance and success are therefore heavily dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully.\nOur current business strategy envisions several initiatives, including investing in new real estate and real estate related opportunities, such as the development of our real estate, expanding our portfolio of income producing commercial properties, expanding the scope of our hospitality assets and services, entering into strategic alliances, investing in businesses related to our real estate development, management, and operating activities, investing in Securities or longer term investments in real estate investment trusts and other investments in illiquid securities and continuing to efficiently contribute to our bottom line performance. For example, in August 2018, we announced plans to create a new home development within the Watersound Origins community and entered into a definitive long-term contractual agreement with Kolter Homes, LLC (\u201cKolter\u201d) that will consist of approximately 466 single-family detached homes to be constructed by Kolter. We may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy or achieve the benefits of our business plan, including those contemplated by our long-term contractual agreement with Kolter. If we are not successful in achieving our objectives, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nManagement has discretion as to the investments we make and may not use these funds effectively.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $195.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. We plan to continue to invest in Securities or longer term investments in real estate investment trusts and other investments in illiquid securities until we can find what we believe to be other advantageous opportunities for these funds. Our management has discretion in the selection of these investments and could make investments that do not improve our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition or enhance the value of our common stock or which result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and stock price. Additionally, longer term investments, such as real estate investment trusts and other investments in illiquid securities are inherently riskier investments and could result in our losing some or all of our investment as well as not being able to liquidate our position when we would otherwise wish to do so.\nOur investments in new business opportunities are inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect our operations.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business opportunities, such as our new home development project within the Watersound Origins community, the expansion of our portfolio of income producing\ncommercial properties, including potential ventures into branded fuel stations and convenience stores, the development of our real estate and the expansion of port related opportunities at the Port of Port St. Joe. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities incurred and expenses associated with these new investments, including development costs, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such opportunities. Because these ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nWe intend to invest our assets in ways such that we will not have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, we may be unable to make some potentially profitable investments.\nWe are not registered as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) and we intend to invest our assets in a manner such that we are not required to register as an investment company. This plan will require monitoring our portfolio so that (a) on an unconsolidated basis we will not have more than 40% of total assets (excluding United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) government securities and cash items) in investment securities or (b) we will meet and maintain another exemption from registration. As a result, we may be (1) unable to make some potentially profitable investments, (2) unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell or (3) forced to sell investments in investment securities before we would otherwise want to do so.\nIf Fairholme controls us within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, we may be unable to engage in transactions with potential strategic partners, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2018, clients of Fairholme Capital Management, L.L.C. (\u201cFCM\u201d, an investment advisor registered with the SEC), Fairholme Funds, Inc. (the \u201cFairholme Fund\u201d) and/or one or more of their affiliates, which we refer to, along with Fairholme Holdings and FTC (each as defined below), as Fairholme, beneficially owned approximately 41.18% of our common stock and Fairholme, including Bruce R. Berkowitz, Chairman of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), and clients of FCM and FTC, collectively, beneficially owned 43.76% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Berkowitz is the Chief Investment Officer of FCM, a director of both Fairholme Fund and Fairholme Trust Company, LLC (\u201cFTC\u201d, a non-depository trust company regulated by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation) and the Chairman of our Board. Mr. Berkowitz is also the Manager of, and controls entities that own and control, Fairholme Holdings, LLC (\u201cFairholme Holdings\u201d), which wholly owns FCM and FTC. Cesar Alvarez, a member of our Board, also serves as a director of the Fairholme Fund and a director of FTC. In addition, Howard Frank is a member of our Board and serves as a director of the Fairholme Fund. Fairholme has served as our investment advisor since April 2013. Fairholme does not receive any compensation for services as our investment advisor.\nUnder the Investment Company Act, \u201ccontrol\u201d means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company. Any person who owns beneficially, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of a company is presumed to control such company. The SEC has considered factors other than ownership of voting securities in determining control, including an official position with the company when such was obtained as a result of the influence over the company. Accordingly, even if Fairholme\u2019s beneficial ownership in us is below 25% of our outstanding voting securities, Fairholme may nevertheless be deemed to control us. The Investment Company Act generally prohibits a company controlled by an investment company from engaging in certain transactions with any affiliate of the investment company or affiliates of the affiliate, subject to limited exceptions. An affiliate of an investment company is defined in the Investment Company Act as, among other things, any company 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by the investment company, a company directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the investment company or a company directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the investment company.\nWe believe that Fairholme is currently affiliated with Imperial Metals Corp. Due to this affiliation, should Fairholme be deemed to control us, under the Investment Act, we may be prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with this entity and certain of their affiliates and any future affiliates of Fairholme, unless an exception applies. To the extent Fairholme is not deemed to control us, if Fairholme\u2019s beneficial interest in us is at or above 5% of\nour outstanding voting securities, it would remain our affiliate and we may be prohibited from engaging in certain transactions with it and its affiliates.\nThis could adversely affect our ability to enter into transactions freely and compete in the marketplace. In addition, significant penalties and other consequences may arise as a result of a violation for companies found to be in violation of the Investment Company Act.\nIf the SEC were to disagree with our Investment Company Act determinations, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have not requested approval or guidance from the SEC with respect to our Investment Company Act determinations, including, in particular: our treatment of any subsidiary as majority-owned; the compliance of any subsidiary with any exemption under the Investment Company Act, including any subsidiary\u2019s determinations with respect to the consistency of its assets or operations with the requirements thereof or whether our interests in one or more subsidiaries constitute investment securities for purposes of the 40% test. If the SEC were to disagree with our treatment of one or more subsidiaries as being majority-owned, excepted from the Investment Company Act, with our determination that one or more of our other holdings do not constitute investment securities for purposes of the 40% test, or with our determinations as to the nature of the business in which we engage or the manner in which we hold ourselves out, we and/or one or more of our subsidiaries would need to adjust our operating strategies or assets in order for us to continue to pass the 40% test or register as an investment company, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, we may be required to adjust our operating strategy and holdings, or to effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time or price at which, we would not otherwise choose, if there are changes in the laws or rules governing our Investment Company Act status or that of our subsidiaries, or if the SEC or its staff provides more specific or different guidance regarding the application of relevant provisions of, and rules under, the Investment Company Act.\nIf the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that we were required, but failed, to register as an investment company in violation of the Investment Company Act, we would have to cease business activities, we would breach representations and warranties and/or be in default as to certain of our contracts and obligations, civil or criminal actions could be brought against us, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court were to require enforcement and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business, any or all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nReturns on our investments may be limited by our investment guidelines and restrictions.\nIn 2013, we established investment guidelines and restrictions approved by the Investment Committee of our Board pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement (the \u201cInvestment Management Agreement\u201d) with FTC, as amended. In 2016, we and FTC entered into an Amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to the Investment Management Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, we modified the investment guidelines and restrictions described in the Investment Management Agreement to (i) decrease from at least 50% to 25% the amount of the investment account that must be held in cash and cash equivalents, (ii) permit the investment account to be invested in common equity securities; however, common stock investments shall be limited to exchange-traded common equities, shall not exceed 5% ownership of a single issuer and, cumulatively, the common stock held in our investment portfolio shall not exceed $100.0 million market value and (iii) provide that the aggregate market value of investments in common stock, preferred stock or other equity investments cannot exceed 25% of the market value of our investment portfolio at the time of purchase. All other material investment guidelines remain the same, including restrictions that no more than 15% of the investment account be invested in securities of any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government), and that any investment in any one issuer (excluding the U.S. Government) that exceeds 10%, but not 15%, requires the consent of at least two members of the Investment Committee.\nThese above limitations may restrict our ability to make certain investments and may negatively impact the return that we could otherwise receive from our investment account. This could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur future growth is dependent on transactions with strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully (1) attract desirable strategic partners; (2) complete agreements with strategic partners and/or (3) manage relationships with strategic partners going forward, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may seek strategic partnerships, including the formation of JVs, to develop real estate, capitalize on the potential of our residential, commercial and industrial opportunities and maximize the value of our assets. These strategic partnerships, JVs and other ongoing strategic real estate investments may bring development experience, industry expertise, financial resources, financing capabilities, brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets. We cannot assure, however, that we will have sufficient resources, experience and/or skills to locate desirable partners. We also may not be able to attract partners who want to conduct business in desirable geographic locations and who have the assets, reputation or other characteristics that would optimize our development and asset management opportunities.\nOnce a strategic partner has been identified, actually reaching an agreement on a transaction may be difficult to complete and may take a considerable amount of time considering that negotiations require careful balancing of the parties\u2019 various objectives, assets, skills and interests. A formal partnership may also involve special risks such as:\n\u00b7\nour partner may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the real estate investments;\n\u00b7\nour partner could experience financial difficulties, become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of property or increase our financial commitment to the strategic partnership;\n\u00b7\nwe may disagree with our partner about decisions affecting the real estate investments or partnership, which could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and directors and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, which may delay important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and\n\u00b7\nactions by our partner may subject property owned by the partnership to liabilities or have other adverse consequences.\nA key complicating factor is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors unrelated to our business. These competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan. We cannot assure that we will have sufficient resources, experience and/or skills to effectively manage our ongoing relationships with our strategic partners. We may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation of a strategic partner deteriorates. If we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nLosses in the fair value of Securities, and the concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular issuer, industry, group of related industries or geographic sector, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, our equity investments may fail to appreciate and may decline in value or become worthless.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $226.0 million in our investment accounts. Of this amount, we hold $180.9 million in cash equivalents, $2.0 million in corporate debt securities, $36.1 million in preferred stock investments and $7.0 million in U.S. Treasury securities. Additionally, in 2016, we entered into an Amendment to our Investment Management Agreement which permits us to invest in common equity securities. The market value of these investments is subject to change from period to period. Our Securities currently include investments in non-investment grade corporate debt securities and preferred stock of seven issuers and one issuer of preferred stock that is investment grade. Pursuant to our Investment Management Agreement with FTC, we could invest up to a total of 15% of the investment account in any one issuer as of the date of purchase.\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our Securities and these instruments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market\u2019s assessment of issuer credit quality, increases in delinquency and default\nrates, changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors. A downgrade of the U.S. government\u2019s credit rating could also decrease the value of our Securities.\nLosses in the fair value of our Securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other-than-temporary impaired. The evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment is based on various factors, including the financial condition, business prospects, industry and creditworthiness of the issuer, severity and length of time the securities were in a loss position, our ability and intent to hold investments until unrealized losses are recovered or until maturity. If a decline in fair value is considered other-than-temporary, the carrying amount of the security is written down and the amount of the credit-related component is recognized in earnings. During 2018, based on these factors we determined that unrealized losses related to our corporate debt securities were other-than-temporary and recorded an impairment of $2.3 million for credit-related loss in investment income, net in our consolidated statements of income. The unrealized loss related to our investments - debt securities and restricted investments of $0.9 million was determined to be temporary at December 31, 2018.\nAs a result of the concentration of our Securities, the performance of our investments may be disproportionately affected by any adverse change in the financial condition of these issuers or the market value of any of the Securities in our portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurthermore, although equity securities have historically generated higher average total returns than other types of securities over the long term, common equity securities have also experienced significantly more volatility in those returns. The market price of common stock is subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors including the operating performance of companies and other risks that may affect specific economic sectors, industries or segments of the market, as well as adverse economic conditions generally, all of which are outside of our control. Our equity investments may fail to appreciate and may decline in value or become worthless. A substantial decline in the value of our equity investments would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s real estate investments, including our land and timber holdings, are generally illiquid.\nReal estate investments and timber holdings, are relatively illiquid\u037e therefore, it may be difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises, which may limit the Company's ability to make rapid adjustments in the size and content of our income property portfolio or other real estate or timber assets in response to economic or other conditions. Illiquid assets typically experience greater price volatility, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. In addition, validating third party pricing for illiquid assets may be more subjective than more liquid assets. As a result, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our real estate or timber assets quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our assets.\nWe face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.\nWe continue to have significant cash balances that are invested in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. From time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):\n\u00b7\ndirect obligations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\u201cTreasury\u201d);\n\u00b7\nobligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. federal government or its agencies;\n\u00b7\ntaxable municipal securities;\n\u00b7\nobligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;\n\u00b7\ncommercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;\n\u00b7\nrepurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;\n\u00b7\nboth registered and unregistered money market funds; and\n\u00b7\nother highly rated short-term securities.\nInvestments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the benefits of the federal \u201cqualified opportunity zone\u201d program, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs part of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, Congress established the Qualified Opportunity Zone program (the \u201cQOZ Program\u201d), which provides preferential tax treatment to taxpayers who invest eligible capital gains into qualified opportunity funds (\u201cQOFs\u201d), QOFs are self-certifying entities that invest their capital in economically distressed communities that have been designated as qualified opportunity zones (\u201cQOZs\u201d) by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and Treasury. We have recently positioned ourselves to take advantage of the tax benefits offered by the QOZ Program. However, because the QOZ Program is relatively new, further guidance on the QOZ Program is still forthcoming. On October 19, 2018, the IRS and Treasury issued proposed regulations, which address some of the uncertainties under the QOZ Program. Nonetheless, a number of open questions remain. Although additional guidance (in the form of additional proposed Treasury regulations) is expected, it is possible that various uncertainties will remain as to the interpretation of the rules. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such additional guidance may have on our investment strategy. In fact, such guidance may render ineligible certain categories of projects that are currently expected to qualify. As a result, we may be unable to fully realize the benefits of the QOZ Program.\nRisks Related to our Current Business\nOur results of operations may vary significantly from period to period, which could adversely impact our stock price, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nResidential real estate sales tend to vary from period to period, particularly sales to homebuilders, who tend to buy multiple homesites in sporadic transactions. Commercial real estate projects are likewise subject to one-off sales and the timing of development of specific projects depends on demand.\nMoreover, as it relates to all of our residential and commercial land-use entitlements in hand or in process, we seek higher and better uses for our assets through a range of activities from strategic land planning and development, infrastructure improvements and promoting economic development in the regions where we operate; and therefore may explore the sale of assets opportunistically or when we believe that we or others can better deploy those resources. As a consequence, there may be reporting periods in which we have no, or significantly less, revenue from residential or commercial real estate sales.\nOur hospitality operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations. Revenue from our hospitality operations are typically higher in the second and third quarters; however, they can vary depending on the timing of holidays and school breaks, including spring break. In December 2017, we sold our short-term vacation rental management business. Following the sale we no longer manage third party vacation rentals, but continue to manage rental properties we own, which will cause our future operating results to vary from prior periods.\nThese variables have caused, and may continue to cause, our operating results to vary significantly from period to period, which could have an adverse impact on our stock price, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation and growth management initiatives that may restrict, make more costly or otherwise adversely impact our ability to develop our real estate investments or otherwise conduct our operations.\nA large part of our business strategy is dependent on our ability to develop and manage real estate in Northwest Florida, including exploring opportunities in mixed-use communities and expanding the Port of Port St. Joe operations. Approval to develop real property in Florida entails an extensive entitlements process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requiring discretionary action by local government. This process is often\npolitical, uncertain and may require significant exactions in order to secure approvals. Real estate projects in Florida must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the \u201cGrowth Management Act\u201d) and local land development regulations. Compliance with the Growth Management Act and local land development regulations is usually lengthy and costly and can be expected to materially affect our real estate development activities.\nThe Growth Management Act requires local governments to adopt comprehensive plans guiding and controlling future real property development in their respective jurisdictions and to evaluate, assess and keep those plans current. Included in all comprehensive plans is a future land use map, which sets forth allowable land use development rights. Some of our land has an \u201cagricultural\u201d or \u201csilviculture\u201d future land use designation and we are required to seek an amendment to the future land use map to develop real estate projects. Approval of these comprehensive plan map amendments is highly discretionary.\nAll development orders and permits must be consistent with the comprehensive plan. Each plan must address such topics as future land use and capital improvements and make adequate provision for a multitude of public services including transportation, schools, solid waste disposal, sewerage, potable water supply, drainage, affordable housing, open space, parks and others. The local governments\u2019 comprehensive plans must also establish \u201clevels of service\u201d with respect to certain specified public facilities, including roads, schools and services to residents. In many areas, infrastructure funding has not kept pace with growth, causing facilities to operate below established levels of service. Local governments are prohibited from issuing development orders or permits if the development will reduce the level of service for public facilities below the level of service established in the local government\u2019s comprehensive plan, unless the developer either sufficiently improves the services up front to meet the required level of service or provides financial assurances that the additional services will be provided as the project progresses. In addition, local governments that fail to keep their plans current may be prohibited by law from amending their plans to allow for new development.\nIf any one or more of these factors were to occur, we may be unable to develop our real estate projects successfully or within the expected timeframes. Changes in the Growth Management Act or the interpretation thereof, new enforcement of these laws or the enactment of new laws regarding the development of real property could lead to a decline in our ability to develop and market our communities successfully and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to service our demand and negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nOur existing real estate investments are concentrated in Northwest Florida; therefore our long-term financial results are largely dependent on the economic growth of Northwest Florida.\nThe economic growth of Northwest Florida, where most of our land is located, is an important factor in creating demand for our products and services. Our principal sources of revenue are (1) sales of homesites or entitled land to homebuilders and others in connection with residential housing developments, (2) sales and leasing of commercial real estate, (3) revenue generated through our hotel, club membership and other leasing activities that are principally tourism related and (4) future revenue from multi-family and other leasing projects. Consequently, demand for our products largely depends on the growth of the local economy.\nWe believe that the future economic growth of Northwest Florida will largely depend on the ability and willingness of state and local governments, in combination with the private sector, (1) to plan and complete significant infrastructure improvements in the region, such as new transportation hubs, roads, rail, pipeline, medical facilities and schools and (2) to attract companies offering high-quality, high salary jobs to large numbers of new employees. If new businesses and new employees in Northwest Florida do not grow as anticipated, demand for residential and commercial real estate and demand to expand the Port of Port St. Joe will not meet our expectations and our future growth will be adversely affected.\nChanges in the demographics affecting projected population growth in Florida, particularly Northwest Florida, including a decrease in the migration of Baby Boomers, could adversely affect our business.\nFlorida has experienced strong population growth in the past few decades, particularly during the real estate boom in the first half of the last decade. However, a decline in the rate of migration into Florida could occur due to any one of a number of factors affecting Florida, including weak economic conditions, changes in immigration law or enforcement, restrictive credit, the occurrence of hurricanes and increased costs of living.\nThe success of our communities will be dependent on strong migration and population expansion in our regions of development, primarily Northwest Florida. We also believe that Baby Boomers (generally considered to be the generation born between 1946 and 1964) seeking retirement or vacation homes in Florida will remain important target customers for our real estate products in the future. Florida\u2019s population growth could be negatively affected in the future by factors such as adverse economic conditions, the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters and the high cost of real estate, insurance and property taxes. Furthermore, those persons considering moving to Florida may not view Northwest Florida as an attractive place to live or own a second home and may choose to live in another region of the state. In addition, as an alternative to Florida, other states such as Georgia, North and South Carolina and Tennessee are increasingly becoming retirement destinations. These states are attracting retiring Baby Boomers and the workforce population who may have otherwise considered moving to Florida. If Florida, especially Northwest Florida, experiences an extended period of slow growth, or even net out-migration, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition would likely suffer.\nMortgage financing issues, including lack of supply of mortgage loans, tightened lending requirements and possible future increases in interest rates, could reduce demand for our products.\nMany purchasers of our real estate products obtain mortgage loans to finance a substantial portion of the purchase price or they may need to obtain mortgage loans to finance the construction costs of homes to be built on homesites purchased from us. Also, our homebuilder customers depend on retail purchasers who rely on mortgage financing. Many mortgage lenders and investors in mortgage loans experienced severe financial difficulties arising from losses incurred on sub-prime and other loans originated before the downturn in the real estate market. As a result, the mortgage industry remains under scrutiny and continues to face the challenges of increased regulation at federal, state and local levels. Because of these challenges, the supply of mortgage products has been constrained and the eligibility requirements for borrowers have been tightened. Constraints on the mortgage lending industry could adversely affect potential purchasers of our products, including our homebuilder customers, thus having a negative effect on demand in our communities.\nRecently, interest rates for home mortgage loans have increased following a period in which they generally remained low. Mortgage rates may continue to increase in the future, which could adversely affect the demand for residential real estate. In addition to residential real estate, increased interest rates and restrictions in the availability of credit could also negatively impact sales or development of our commercial properties or other land we offer for sale. If interest rates increase and the ability or willingness of prospective buyers to finance real estate purchases is adversely affected, our sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nWe have significant operations and properties in Northwest Florida that could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, manmade disasters, severe weather conditions or other significant disruptions.\nOur corporate headquarters and our properties are located in Northwest Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. Because of its location between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes. Depending on where any particular hurricane makes landfall, our developments in Northwest Florida, especially our coastal properties, could experience significant, if not catastrophic, damage. Such damage could materially delay sales or lessen demand for our residential or commercial real estate in affected communities and lessen demand for our hospitality operations and leasing operations. If our corporate headquarters facility is damaged or destroyed, we may have difficulty performing certain corporate and operational functions.\nOn October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle, which resulted in widespread damage to the area. The majority of our properties incurred minimal or no damage; however, we are continuing to make\na full assessment of the extent of the impact. As discussed below, we maintain property and business interruption insurance, subject to certain deductibles, and are currently assessing claims under such policies; however, the timing and amount of insurance proceeds are uncertain and may not be sufficient to cover all losses. See Note 7. Hurricane Michael included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn addition to hurricanes, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, fires, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts, extreme heat, or other adverse weather events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects. The occurrence of these natural disasters could also have a material adverse effect on our forestry business, if timber inventory is destroyed. Furthermore, an increase in sea levels due to long-term global warming could have a material adverse effect on our coastal properties and forestry business. The occurrence of natural disasters and the threat of adverse climate changes could also have a long-term negative effect on the attractiveness of Florida as a location for residences and as a location for new employers that can create high-quality jobs needed to spur growth in Northwest Florida.\nAdditionally, we are susceptible to manmade disasters or disruptions, such as oil spills like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, acts of terrorism, power outages and communications failures. If a hurricane, natural disaster, manmade disaster or other significant disruption occurs, we may experience disruptions to our operations and damage to our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurthermore, any adverse change in the economic climate of Florida, or our regions of the state, and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of Florida, or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities. Ultimately, our ability to execute our business strategy may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations.\nOur insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate to cover any losses we may incur.\nWe maintain insurance on our properties, including property, liability, fire, flood and extended coverage. However, we do not insure our timber assets and we self-insure home warranty claims. Additionally, our insurance for hurricanes is capped at $50.0 million per named storm and is subject to deductibles. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also may make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, we may not receive insurance proceeds or the insurance proceeds we receive may not fully cover business interruptions or losses and our earnings, liquidity, or capital resources could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in property insurance premiums and decreases in availability of homeowner property insurance in Florida could reduce customer demand for homes and homesites in our developments.\nHomeowner property insurance companies doing business in Florida have reacted to previous hurricanes by increasing premiums, requiring higher deductibles, reducing limits, restricting coverage, imposing exclusions, refusing to insure certain property owners, and in some instances, ceasing insurance operations in the state. It is uncertain what effect these actions may have on future property insurance availability and rates in the state.\nFurthermore, Florida\u2019s state-owned property insurance company, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., underwrites homeowner property insurance. If there were to be a catastrophic hurricane or series of hurricanes to hit Florida, the exposure of the state government to property insurance claims could place extreme stress on state finances.\nThe high costs of property insurance premiums in Florida could deter potential customers from purchasing a homesite in one of our developments or make Northwest Florida less attractive to new employers that can create high quality jobs needed to increase growth in the region, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA decline in consumers\u2019 discretionary spending or a change in consumer preferences could reduce our sales and harm our business.\nOur real estate and hospitality segments\u2019 revenue ultimately depends on consumer discretionary spending, which is influenced by factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the availability of discretionary income and credit, weather, consumer confidence and unemployment levels. Any material decline in the amount of consumer discretionary spending could reduce our revenue and harm our business. These economic and market conditions, combined with continuing difficulties in the credit markets and the resulting pressures on liquidity, may also place a number of our key customers under financial stress, which could adversely affect our occupancy rates and our profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nDownturns of the real estate market in Northwest Florida could adversely affect our operations.\nDemand for real estate is sensitive to changes in economic conditions over which we have no control, including the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. In addition, the real estate market is subject to downturns, and our business is especially sensitive to economic conditions in Northwest Florida, where many of our developments are located, and, more broadly, the Southeast region of the U.S., which in the past has produced a high percentage of customers for the hospitality and seasonal vacation products in our Northwest Florida communities. If market conditions experience volatility or worsen, the demand for our hospitality and real estate products could decline, negatively impacting our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRecent tax law changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive.\nHistorically, significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, generally have been deductible expenses for the purpose of calculating an individual\u2019s federal, and in some cases state, taxable income as itemized deductions. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was enacted. The Tax Act established new limits on the federal tax deductions individual taxpayers may take on mortgage loan interest payments and on state and local taxes, including real estate taxes; the new Tax Act also raised the standard deduction. These changes could reduce the perceived affordability of homeownership, and therefore the demand for homes, and/or have a moderating impact on home sales prices in areas with relatively high housing prices and/or high state and local income taxes and real estate taxes. These changes may increase the after-tax cost of owning a home, which is likely to adversely impact the demand for homes and could reduce the prices for which we can sell homesites, particularly in higher priced communities.\nSignificant competition could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with local, regional and national real estate leasing and development companies, some of which may have greater financial, marketing, sales and other resources than we do. Competition from real estate leasing and development companies may adversely affect our ability to attract tenants and lease our commercial properties, attract purchasers and sell residential and commercial real estate and attract and retain experienced real estate leasing and development personnel. In addition, we face competition for tenants from other retail shopping centers and commercial facilities.\nA number of highly competitive companies participate in the hospitality industry. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain guests and club members depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our products and services from those offered by others.\nThe forestry business is also highly competitive in terms of price and quality. Wood products are subject to increasing competition from a variety of substitute products, including non-wood and engineered wood products. There can be no assurance we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are dependent upon homebuilders as customers, but our ability to attract homebuilder customers and their ability or willingness to satisfy their purchase commitments may be uncertain.\nWe are highly dependent upon our relationships with homebuilders to be the primary customers for our homesites and to provide construction services in our residential developments. The homebuilder customers that have already committed to purchase homesites from us could decide to reduce, delay or cancel their existing commitments to purchase homesites in our developments. From time to time we finance real estate sales with mortgage note receivables. If these homebuilders fail to pay their debts to us or delay paying us, it would reduce our anticipated cash flows. Homebuilders also may not view our developments as desirable locations for homebuilding operations or they may choose to purchase land from other sellers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with real estate development that could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur real estate development activities entail risks that could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\u00b7\nconstruction delays or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs;\n\u00b7\nshortages of skilled labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the U.S. and Florida especially;\n\u00b7\nclaims for construction defects after property has been developed, including claims by purchasers and property owners\u2019 associations;\n\u00b7\nan inability to obtain required governmental permits and authorizations;\n\u00b7\nan inability to secure tenants necessary to support commercial projects; and\n\u00b7\ncompliance with building codes and other local regulations.\nOur leasing projects may not yield anticipated returns, which could harm our operating results, reduce cash flow, or the ability to sell commercial assets.\nOur business strategy includes the development and leasing of commercial properties, management of commercial properties and commercial assets for sale. These commercial developments may not be as successful as expected due to leasing related risks, including the risk that we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or obtain lease rates that are consistent with our projections, as well as the risks generally associated with real estate development. Additionally, development of leasing projects involves the risk associated with the significant time lag between commencement and completion of the project. This time lag subjects us to greater risks relating to fluctuations in the general economy, our ability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms, if at all, our ability to achieve projected rental rates, the pace that we will be able to lease to new tenants, higher than estimated construction costs (including labor and material costs), and delays in the completion of projects because of, among other factors, inclement weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receiving zoning or other regulatory approvals, or man-made or natural disasters. If any one of these factors negatively impacts our leasing projects we may not yield anticipated returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and ability to sell commercial assets.\nWe face potential adverse effects from the loss of commercial tenants.\nA component of our business strategy is the development and leasing of commercial properties. The default, financial distress, or bankruptcy of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our commercial properties. If one or more of our tenants, particularly an anchor tenant, declares bankruptcy, defaults or voluntarily vacates from the leased premises, we may be unable to re-lease such space or to re-lease it on comparable or more favorable terms. Additionally, the loss of an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. This could adversely affect our properties and growth.\nWe are subject to various risks inherent to the hospitality industry beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and value of our hospitality assets.\nOur business is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry and the agreements under which we operate, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nsignificant competition from other hospitality providers and lodging alternatives\u037e\n\u00b7\nan increase in supply of hotel rooms that exceeds increases in demand\u037e\n\u00b7\ndependence on business and leisure travel\u037e\n\u00b7\ngovernmental action and uncertainty resulting from U.S. and global political trends, including potential barriers to travel, trade and immigration\u037e\n\u00b7\nincreases in energy costs and other travel expenses, which may adversely affect travel patterns\u037e\n\u00b7\nour relationships with and the performance of third-party managers and franchisors\u037e\n\u00b7\nreduced travel due to geo-political uncertainty, including terrorism, legislation or executive policies, travel-related health concerns, including the widespread outbreak of infectious or contagious diseases in the U.S., inclement weather conditions, including natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, and airline strikes or disruptions\u037e\n\u00b7\nreduced travel due to adverse national, regional or local economic and market conditions\u037e\n\u00b7\nchanges in desirability of geographic regions in which our hotels are located\u037e\n\u00b7\nincreases in operating costs, including increases in the cost of property insurance, utilities and real estate and personal property taxes, due to inflation and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates\u037e\n\u00b7\nlabor shortages and increases in the cost of labor due to low unemployment rates or to government regulations surrounding wage rates, health care coverage and other benefits\u037e\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with applicable laws and regulations\u037e\n\u00b7\nnatural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, mudslides and floods\u037e and\n\u00b7\nany inability to remodel outmoded buildings as required by the franchise or lease agreement.\nAny of the these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for our hospitality products or services, or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties, develop new properties or add amenities to our existing properties. As a result, any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.\nThe hospitality industry is subject to seasonal volatility, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations.\nThe hotel industry is seasonal in nature. Generally, occupancy rates and hotel revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. This seasonality causes periodic fluctuations in room revenues, occupancy levels, room rates and operating expenses in particular hotels. We can provide no assurance that our cash flows will be sufficient to offset any shortfalls that occur as a result of these fluctuations. As a result, there may be quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations.\nThe profitability of our hotels will depend on the performance of hotel management.\nThe profitability of our hotels and hospitality investments will depend largely upon the ability of management that we employ to generate revenues that exceed operating expenses. The failure of hotel management to manage the hotels effectively would adversely affect the cash flow received from hotel and hospitality operations.\nWe provide a limited guarantee of the debt for our Pier Park North JV, and may in the future enter into similar agreements, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have agreed to provide a limited guarantee in connection with our Pier Park North JV (\u201cPier Park North JV\u201d), and may in the future agree to similar agreements. In October 2015, the Pier Park North JV entered into a $48.2 million loan (the \u201cPPN JV Loan\u201d) that matures in November 2025. As of December 31, 2018, $46.4 million was outstanding on the PPN JV Loan. Pursuant to the PPN JV Loan, we have provided a limited guarantee in favor of the lender that covers losses arising as a result of: (i) tenant security deposits; (ii) tenant rents; (iii) costs and expenses related to any environmental clean-up; (iv) liability for fraud or material breach of warranty with respect to the financing; (v) unpaid real estate taxes assessed against the property; (vi) failure to maintain required insurance; (vii) foreclosure of the security instrument or (viii) failure of the JV to comply with certain covenants in the agreement. In addition, the guarantee can become full recourse in the case of any fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the JV; any voluntary transfer or encumbrance of the property in violation of the due-on-sale clause in the security instrument; upon commencement of voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and upon breach of covenants in the security instrument. If we were to become obligated to perform on the guarantee, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See Note 12. Debt, Net included in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nEnvironmental and other regulations may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur properties are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations on our development ability. In most cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits, which involve a long, uncertain and costly regulatory process. Our land holdings contain jurisdictional wetlands, some of which may be unsuitable for development or prohibited from development by law. Development approval most often requires mitigation for impacts to wetlands that require land to be conserved at a disproportionate ratio versus the actual wetlands impacted and approved for development. Some of our property is undeveloped land located in areas where development may have to avoid, minimize or mitigate for impacts to the natural habitats of various protected wildlife or plant species. Additionally, much of our property is in coastal areas that usually have a more restrictive permitting burden or must address issues such as coastal high hazard, hurricane evacuation, floodplains and dune protection.\nIn addition, our current or past ownership, operation and leasing of real property, and our current or past transportation and other operations, are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and other regulations. The provisions and enforcement of these environmental laws and regulations may become more stringent in the future. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in, among other things, the following:\n\u00b7\ncivil penalties;\n\u00b7\nremediation expenses;\n\u00b7\nnatural resource damages;\n\u00b7\npersonal injury damages;\n\u00b7\npotential injunctions;\n\u00b7\ncease and desist orders; and\n\u00b7\ncriminal penalties.\nIn addition, some of these environmental laws impose strict liability, which means that we may be held liable for any environmental damage on our property regardless of fault.\nSome of our past and present real property, particularly properties used in connection with our previous transportation and papermill operations, were involved in the storage, use or disposal of hazardous substances that have contaminated and may in the future contaminate the environment. We may bear liability for this contamination and for the costs of cleaning up a site at which we have disposed of, or to which we have transported, hazardous substances. The presence of hazardous substances on a property may also adversely affect our ability to sell or develop the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral.\nAdditionally, in recent years, assessments of the potential impacts of climate change have begun to influence governmental authorities, consumer behavior patterns and the general business environment of the U.S., including, but not limited to, energy-efficiency measures, water use measures and land-use practices. The implementation of these polices may require us to invest additional capital in our properties or it may restrict the availability of land we are able to develop. These changes, or changes in other environmental laws or their interpretation thereof, new enforcement of laws, the identification of new facts or the failure of other parties to perform remediation at our current or former facilities could lead to new or greater liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could impair our financial results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business, our operations and our position as an owner and operator of real estate and related ventures. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could adversely affect our financial condition, our results of operations or impose additional restrictions or limitations on us. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, these proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial resources to defend our Company. For example, in 2015, we fully resolved an SEC investigation regarding our policies and practices concerning impairment of investment in real estate assets principally as reflected in our financial results for 2010, 2009 and prior periods. The settlement and all allegations related to actions taken prior to the 2011 replacement of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. None of the SEC\u2019s allegations, findings, sanctions, remedies or orders related to any of our current directors or controlling shareholders. Without admitting or denying any factual allegations, we consented to the SEC\u2019s issuance of an administrative order.\nPursuant to the order, we agreed to pay penalties, disgorgements and interest of approximately $3.5 million. In connection with the SEC investigation, we also incurred significant legal expenses and devoted substantial management resources to its resolution. If we were to become subject to other litigation or regulatory proceedings in the future, it could impair our financial results of operations. In addition, as a result of the order, we became an \u201cineligible issuer\u201d under Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, which means that for a period of three years after the order, we were not able to use certain streamlined registration procedures, and we will be unable to rely on an exemption from registration for the sale of securities under Regulation D for a period of five years after the order, both of which could make it harder for us to sell securities, including shares of our common stock. Further, we were unable to avail ourselves of the statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for a period of three years after the order.\nIn addition, the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex. Moreover, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals. As a result, the prospect of third-party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements. Third-party challenges in the form of litigation could result in denial of the right to develop, or would, by their nature, adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals. In addition, adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design, scope, plans and profitability of a project.\nLimitations on the access to the airport runway at the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport may have an adverse effect on the demand for our VentureCrossings land adjacent to the airport.\nOur land donation agreement with the airport authority and the deed for the airport land provide access rights to the airport runway from our adjacent lands. We subsequently entered into an access agreement with the airport authority that provides access to the airport runway. Under the terms of the access agreement, we are subject to certain requirements of the airport authority, including but not limited to the laws administered by the Federal Aviation Administration (the \u201cFAA\u201d), the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (the \u201cFDEP\u201d), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the \u201cCorps of Engineers\u201d), and Bay County. Should security measures at airports become more restrictive in the future due\nto circumstances beyond our control, FAA regulations governing these access rights may impose additional limitations that could significantly impair or restrict access rights.\nIn addition, we are required to obtain environmental permits from each of the Corps of Engineers and the FDEP in order to develop the land necessary for access from our planned areas of commercial development to the airport runway. Such permits are often subject to a lengthy agency administrative approval process, and there can be no assurance that such permits will be issued, or that they will be issued in a timely manner.\nWe believe that runway access is a valuable attribute of some of our VentureCrossings land adjacent to the airport, and the failure to maintain such access, the imposition of significant restrictions on such access, or any associated permitting delays or issues, could adversely affect the demand for such lands and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWeather and other natural conditions and regulatory requirements may limit our ability to market and sell our timber assets, which could adversely affect our operations.\nWeather conditions, timber growth cycles, access limitations (for example, restrictions on access to timberlands due to prolonged wet conditions) and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources may restrict our ability to market and sell our timber assets. In addition, our timber assets are subject to damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding, hurricane and other natural disasters. Changes in global climate conditions could intensify one or more of these factors. Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of the timber assets, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be so limited. We do not maintain insurance coverage with respect to damage to our timberlands. Our results of operations and cash flows may therefore be materially adversely affected if we are unable to sell our timber assets at adequate levels or if demand decreases due to an increase in our prices as a result of any of these factors.\nWe face risks associated with third-party service providers, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe rely on various third-parties to conduct the day-to-day operations of our hospitality operations. Failure of such third parties to adequately perform their contracted services could negatively impact our ability to retain customers. As a result, any such failure could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Company or Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) has been volatile. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:\n\u00b7\nannouncements of fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nother announcements concerning our Company or business, including acquisitions or litigation announcements;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market conditions in Northwest Florida or the real estate or real estate development industry in general;\n\u00b7\neconomic and/or political factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u00b7\nchanges in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u00b7\nless volume due to reduced shares outstanding.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years, which have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. Continued volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause shareholders to lose some or all of their investment in our common stock.\nOur common stock has low trading volume.\nAlthough our common stock trades on the NYSE, it is thinly traded and our daily trading volume is low compared to the number of share of common stock we have outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it difficult for a stockholder to sell their common stock quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock.\nFairholme has the ability to influence major corporate decisions, including decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and its interest in our business may conflict with yours.\nBruce R. Berkowitz is the Chief Investment Officer of FCM, a director of FTC and the Chairman of our Board. Mr. Berkowitz is also the Manager of, and controls entities that own and control, Fairholme Holdings, which wholly owns FCM and FTC. Cesar Alvarez is a member of our Board and also serves as a director of the Fairholme Fund and a director of FTC. In addition, Howard Frank is a member of our Board and serves as a director of the Fairholme Fund. As of December 31, 2018, clients of FCM and FTC beneficially owned approximately 41.18% of our common stock and Fairholme, including Mr. Berkowitz and clients of FCM and FTC, collectively beneficially owned 43.76% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Fairholme is in a position to influence:\n\u00b7\nthe vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nthe nomination of individuals to our Board; and\n\u00b7\na change in our control.\nThese factors may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests or that might result in shareholders receiving a premium for their common stock. Our articles of incorporation and certain provisions of Florida law contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control.\nIn addition, Fairholme is in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and may hold, and may, from time to time in the future, acquire interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Fairholme may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nFurthermore, future sales of our common stock by Fairholme, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe loss of the services of our key management, personnel or our ability to recruit staff could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business strategy will depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable management and other professional staff. One of our objectives is to develop and maintain a strong management group at all levels. At any given time, we could lose the services of key executives and other employees. The loss of services of any of our key employees could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition, and our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining key management personnel.\nChanges in our income tax estimates could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes. Our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws. We estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes due to\naudit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities, and changes in tax laws and rates, including the Tax Act. To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, we include the adjustments in the deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. These adjustments could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to utilize our net state operating loss carryforwards.\nWe have suffered losses, for tax and financial statement purposes, which generated significant state net operating loss carryforwards. These state net operating loss carryforwards may be used against taxable income in future periods; however, we will not receive any tax benefits with regard to tax losses incurred except to the extent we have taxable income in the remaining net operating loss carryforward period.\nWe have had to take significant impairments of the carrying value of our investments in real estate and a decline in real estate values or continuing operating losses in our operating properties could result in additional impairments, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOver the past five years, we have recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million related to real estate investments. We have approximately $351.0 million of real estate investments recorded on our books that may be subject to impairment. If market conditions were to deteriorate, our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows could fall below their carrying value and we could be required to take further impairments, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our reported operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our tenants.\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Changes include, but are not limited to, changes in lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards that establish the principles used to recognize revenue for all entities. These changes and others could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data could result in faulty business decisions, damage of reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe face risks associated with security breaches or disruptions, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems, and other significant disruptions of our networks and related systems. For a number of years, we have been increasing our reliance on computers and digital technology. While all of our business and internal employment records require the collection of digital information, our hospitality segment, in particular, requires the collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers, as such information is entered into, processed, summarized, and reported by the various information systems we use. All of these activities give rise to material cyber risks and potential costs and consequences that cannot be estimated or predicted with any certainty. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and other company data, is critical to us. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these networks and related systems, have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, and to date, have not had a significant cyber breach or attack that has had a material impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nEven the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us and our service providers to entirely mitigate this risk. Our failure to maintain the security of the data, which we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and other severe financial and business implications.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements, or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives at all times. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting, which may occur in the future, could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 76123, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "JOE"}
