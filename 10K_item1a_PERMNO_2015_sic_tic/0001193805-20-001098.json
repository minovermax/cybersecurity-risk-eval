{"cik": "922612", "company": "SCHMITT INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company (see the forward-looking statements disclaimer at the beginning of Part 1, Item 1 in this Report). In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Company faces. Unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that the Company now views as minor could become more significant. If the Company were unable to adequately respond to any risks, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the Company cannot be certain that any actions taken to reduce known or unknown risks and uncertainties will be effective.\nGeneral economic conditions and uncertainties may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the industrial and manufacturing sectors, and their impact on levels of capital spending. Economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the Company\u2019s products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, reduction in demand for our customers\u2019 products, customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 access to credit and the stability of the global financial system, the overall health of our markets, unemployment and other macroeconomic factors generally affecting commercial and industrial spending behavior.\nPast distress in the global financial markets and global economy resulted in reduced liquidity and a tightening of credit markets. If these conditions were to reoccur, the Company could experience several potential adverse effects, including the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company\u2019s products, the insolvency of customers resulting in reduced revenues and bad debts, and the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product development and production delays.\nThe Company\u2019s primary markets are volatile and unpredictable.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the demand for our various products in a variety of commercial and industrial markets. In the past, demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers as well as the relative mix of those orders and variations in the volume of orders for a particular product line in a particular quarter.\nTechnological advancement and potential competition.\nThe failure to develop new products or enhance existing products or react to changes in existing technologies could result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to competitors.\nCompetition is intense and the Company\u2019s failure to compete effectively would adversely affect its business.\nThe speed with which the Company can identify new applications for the Company\u2019s various technologies, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to those new markets are important competitive factors. The principal competitive factors in the Company\u2019s markets are product features, performance, reliability and price. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater financial, technical, engineering, production and marketing resources than we do. Those competitors with greater resources may, in addition to other things, be able to better withstand periodic downturns, compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology, or more quickly develop enhancements to products that compete with the products we manufacture and market. New companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in those markets. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to compete effectively in the future, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may experience increased pricing pressure.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience pricing pressure in the sale of our products, from both competitors and customers. Our business, financial condition, margins or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by competitive pressure and intense price-based competition.\nProduction time and the overall cost of products could increase if any of the primary suppliers are lost or if a primary supplier increased the prices of raw materials.\nManufacturing operations could be adversely affected if adequate supplies of raw materials cannot be obtained in a timely manner or if raw material costs increase significantly.\nThe Company may not be able to ramp up manufacturing to satisfy increasing orders, which may lead to the loss of significant revenue opportunities.\nThe Company manufactures several different product lines, all of which involve complicated technology and individual attention for each product made. The production time for each product can vary, depending on a variety of circumstances, including component availability, timing of delivery of components from suppliers and employee availability. Should the Company receive a large increase in orders, an increase in the size of orders or a shortening of the required delivery time on existing orders, the Company may not be able to ramp up manufacturing to satisfy customer expectations, which may lead to the loss of significant revenue opportunities.\nThe Company maintains a significant investment in inventories in anticipation of future revenues.\nThe Company believes it maintains a competitive advantage by shipping product to its customers more rapidly than its competitors and therefore maintains a significant investment in inventories. These inventories are recorded using the lower of cost or net realizable method, which requires management to make certain estimates. Management evaluates the recorded inventory values based on customer demand, market trends and expected future revenues, and changes valuation estimates accordingly. A significant shortfall of revenues may result in carrying higher levels of finished goods and raw materials thereby increasing the risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs. As a result, the Company may not carry adequate reserves to offset such write-downs.\nThe Company may not be able to reduce operating costs quickly enough if revenues decline.\nOperating expenses are generally fixed in nature and largely based on anticipated revenues. However, should future revenues decline significantly and rapidly, there is no guarantee management could take actions that would further reduce operating expenses in either a timely manner or without seriously impacting the operations of the Company.\nFuture success depends in part on attracting and retaining key management and qualified technical and sales personnel.\nFuture success depends on the efforts and continued services of key management, technical and sales personnel. Significant competition exists for such personnel and there is no assurance key technical and sales personnel can be retained or that other highly qualified technical and sales personnel as required can be attracted, assimilated and retained. There is also no guarantee that key employees will not leave and subsequently compete against the Company. The inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely impact the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from future, potential tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the share valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretations of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nFailure to protect intellectual property rights could adversely affect future performance and growth.\nFailure to protect existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or paying other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights. The Company relies on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect such technologies. There is no assurance any of the Company\u2019s U.S. patents will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to other companies.\nFailure to protect our technology systems from cybersecurity occurrences may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nAs part of operations management, we use information technologies for various business functions, including; data processing, data store, and to communication amongst personnel, customers and suppliers. Further, we use information technologies to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We rely on third party providers for some of these information technologies and support.\nDespite our security design and controls and other operational safeguards, and those of our third party providers, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including during the process of upgrading or replacing hardware, software, databases or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Such occurrences could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of data that could subject our organization to civil and criminal penalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation.\nMany of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and research and development initiatives. Failure to protect existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or paying other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights. The Company relies on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect such technologies. There is no assurance any of the Company\u2019s U.S. patents will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to other companies.\nChanges in securities laws and regulations have increased and could continue to increase Company expenses.\nChanges in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, have increased and may continue to increase Company expenses as the Company devotes resources to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the NASDAQ Capital Market, on which the Company\u2019s common stock is listed, has also adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance. These laws, rules and regulations have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. The Company may be required to hire additional personnel and use outside legal, accounting and advisory services to address these laws, rules and regulations. The Company also expects these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future, and the Company may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. Further, the Company\u2019s board members, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which would adversely affect the Company.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19 virus) pandemic may disrupt our business, which could materially affect our operations and results of operations.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have and may continue to impact customer traffic at Company-owned locations, may make it more difficult to staff our Company-owned locations, and, in more severe cases, may cause a temporary inability to obtain supplies, increase commodity costs or continue to cause full and partial closures of our affected Company-owned locations, sometimes for prolonged periods of time. [The Company has implemented closures, modified hours or reductions in on-site staff, resulting in cancelled shifts for some of the Company employees.] These changes and any additional changes may materially adversely affect our business or results of operations, and may impact our liquidity or financial condition, particularly if these changes are in place for a significant amount of time. In addition, our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of the Company's suppliers and business partners were or are suspected of having COVID-19 or other illnesses since this could require the Company, its suppliers or its business partners to quarantine some or all such employees, close and disinfect locations and other facilities or, in the case of our suppliers, delay in delivering the Company's products. If a significant percentage of the Company's workforce, our suppliers and business partners are unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks (including the current COVID-19 pandemic), the Company's operations may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting the Company's business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, such viruses may be transmitted through human contact, and the risk of contracting viruses has caused and could continue to cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places, which has had, and could further have, adverse effects on guest traffic at our locations or the ability to adequately staff locations. The Company could also be adversely affected if government authorities continue to impose restrictions on public gatherings, human interactions, operations of businesses or mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures, restrict hours of operations or impose curfews, restrict the import or export of products or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products. Currently, several states and municipalities in the U.S. and abroad have temporarily suspended the operation of dining in at restaurants and instituted restrictions on public gatherings in light of COVID-19 which has caused venues such as professional sports venues, amusement parks, shopping malls and movie theaters to close temporarily. Additional regulation or requirements with respect to the compensation of the Company's employees and the employees of our business partners could also have an adverse effect on the Company's business. The implementation of such measures and if the virus or other disease continues to spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect the Company's business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could in the future be materially adversely impacted by coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant volatility and uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and customer demand for our products, solutions, and services; our ability to sell and provide our products, solutions, and services, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of our customers to pay for our products, solutions, and services; and any closures of our and our customers\u2019 offices and facilities. Clients may also slow down decision making, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. Any of these events could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties enumerated in the Annual Report and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the financial reporting cycle.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nRisks Related to Ample Hills\nWe may be subject to and adversely affected by claims that were not properly discharged in the Bankruptcy Court order authorizing the Ample Hills Transactions, amounts that we may owe in connection with the Transactions, an inability to recover amounts owed to us in connection with the Transactions or other post-bankruptcy operational risks.\nNotwithstanding the terms of the Bankruptcy Court order dated July 9, 2020 authorizing and approving the Ample Hills Transactions, a creditor (including any governmental agency) of Ample Hills may attempt to assert against us or the assets we acquired an existing lien, claim, interest, or encumbrance. Circumstances in which such claims and obligations that arose prior to the Bankruptcy Court order may not have been properly discharged include, but are not limited to, instances where a claimant had inadequate notice of the bankruptcy filing. In addition, the Ample Hills Agreement does not provide for indemnification of losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of the Transactions. Accordingly, we may not be compensated for losses we may suffer as a result of the foregoing.\nNotwithstanding the terms of the Bankruptcy Court order or the applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, it is possible that parties-in-interest in the Ample Hills bankruptcy may later attempt to challenge the terms or validity of the Transactions.\nOur strategy to increase our growth through acquisitions may be unsuccessful and could adversely affect our business and results.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to further acquire other businesses; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, successfully acquire identified targets or successfully integrate the business of acquired companies to realize the full benefits of the combined businesses.\nWhile we recently acquired Ample Hills in connection with our growth strategy to acquire other businesses, we can provide no assurance that we will identify appropriate acquisition targets, successfully complete any future acquisitions or successfully integrate the business of companies we do acquire. Even if we successfully acquire a business entity, there is no assurance that our combined business will become profitable. The process of completing the integration of acquired businesses could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the pursuit of business acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses, and the incurrence of significant, acquisition related costs in connection with proposed and completed acquisitions, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to achieve the anticipated synergies and benefits from business acquisitions.\nAcquisitions, including the Ample Hills Transactions, involve many complexities, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the acquired business\u2019 past activities, loss of customers, regulatory changes that are not anticipated, difficulties in integrating personnel and human resource programs, integrating accounting systems and other infrastructures, general underperformance of the business under our control versus the prior owners, unanticipated expenses and liabilities, and the impact on its internal controls of compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. There is no guarantee that our acquisitions will increase the profitability and cash flow of the Company, and its efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses. As a result, the realization of anticipated synergies or benefits from acquisitions may be delayed or substantially reduced, and could potentially result in the impairment of its investment in these businesses.\nIf the benefits of any completed or proposed acquisition of do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIf the benefits of any completed acquisition (including Ample Hills) or proposed acquisition do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our common stock prior to such acquisition may decline. The market values of our common stock at the time of an acquisition may vary significantly from their prices on the date the acquisition target was identified.\nIncreases in the cost of food and paper products could harm our profitability and operating results.\nThe cost of the food and paper products we use depends on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We are unable to predict the future cost of our ice cream and expect to experience price volatility for our ice cream products during fiscal 2021. To the extent that dairy prices increase as compared to earlier periods, it could impact our results of operations. If the price of dairy or other food products that we use in our operations significantly increases, or tariffs are imposed, and we choose not to pass, or cannot pass, these increases on to our customers, our operating margins will decrease and such decrease in operating margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFluctuations in weather, supply and demand and economic conditions could adversely affect the cost, availability and quality of some of our critical products, including dairy. Our inability to obtain requisite quantities of high-quality ingredients would adversely affect our ability to provide the menu items that are central to our business, and the highly competitive nature of our industry may limit our ability to pass through increased costs to our customers. Continuing increases in the cost of fuel would increase the distribution costs of our prime products thereby increasing the food and paper cost to us, thus negatively affecting profitability.\nThe retail business of the foodservice industry is highly competitive, and that competition could lower revenues, margins and market share.\nThe retail business of the foodservice industry is intensely competitive regarding price, service, location, personnel and type and quality of product. We compete with international, national, regional and local retailers primarily through the quality, variety and value perception of the products offered. Other key competitive factors include the number of locations, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs, and new product development. We anticipate competition will continue to focus on convenience and pricing. Many of our competitors have substantially larger marketing budgets, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. Changes in pricing or other marketing strategies by these competitors can have an adverse impact on our sales, earnings and growth. Extensive price discounting in the retail business of the foodservice industry could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, we compete within the foodservice market and the retail business not only for customers but also for management and hourly employees. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.\nAny perceived or real health risks related to the food industry could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nWe are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by the following; food spoilage, contamination, or product tampering, consumer product liability claims, and potential cost and disruption of a product recall.\nOur products are susceptible to contamination by disease-producing organisms, or pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, campylobacter, hepatitis A, trichinosis and generic E. coli. Because these pathogens are generally found in the environment, there is a risk that these pathogens could be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the manufacturing, processing, foodservice or consumer level. Our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities and products, as well as our Company operations, are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to health, food preparation, sanitation and safety standards. Difficulties or failures by these companies in obtaining any required licenses or approvals or otherwise complying with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our revenue that is generated from these companies. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that compliance with governmental regulations by our suppliers or in connection with the Company\u2019s operations will eliminate the risks related to food safety.\nEvents reported in the media, or food tampering, whether or not accurate, can cause damage to the Company\u2019s reputation and affect sales and profitability. Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as e-coli, avian flu, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the retail business and could in the future affect our business as well. Our brand\u2019s reputation is an important asset to the business; as a result, anything that damages our brand\u2019s reputation could immediately and severely hurt system-wide sales and, accordingly, revenue and profits. If customers become ill from food-borne illnesses or food tampering, we could also be forced to temporarily close some, or all, locations. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses or food tampering, even those occurring solely at the locations of competitors, could, by resulting in negative publicity about the foodservice industry, adversely affect system sales on a local, regional or system-wide basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our Company-owned locations, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness, or death. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Injury to the Company\u2019s reputation would likely reduce revenue and profits.\nNegative publicity, including complaints on social media platforms and other internet-based communications, could damage our reputation and harm our guest traffic, and in turn, negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals to access a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Consumers value readily available information concerning goods and services that they have or plan to purchase, and may act on such information without further investigation or authentication. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate, as is its impact. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is seemingly limitless and readily available. Information concerning our business and products may be posted on such platforms at any time. Information posted may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms could also be used for dissemination of trade secret information, compromising valuable Company assets. In sum, the dissemination of information online, regardless of its accuracy, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19 virus) pandemic may disrupt our business, which could materially affect our operations and results of operations.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have and may continue to impact customer traffic at Company-owned locations, may make it more difficult to staff our Company-owned locations, and, in more severe cases, may cause a temporary inability to obtain supplies, increase commodity costs or continue to cause full and partial closures of our affected Company-owned locations, sometimes for prolonged periods of time. These changes and any additional changes may materially adversely affect our business or results of operations, and may impact our liquidity or financial condition, particularly if these changes are in place for a significant amount of time. In addition, our operations could be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of the Company's suppliers and business partners were or are suspected of having COVID-19 or other illnesses since this could require the Company, its suppliers or its business partners to quarantine some or all such employees, close and disinfect locations and other facilities or, in the case of our suppliers, delay in delivering the Company's products. If a significant percentage of the Company's workforce, our suppliers and business partners are unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks (including the current COVID-19 pandemic), the Company's operations may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting the Company's business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, such viruses may be transmitted through human contact, and the risk of contracting viruses has caused and could continue to cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places, which has had, and could further have, adverse effects on guest traffic at our locations or the ability to adequately staff locations. The Company could also be adversely affected if government authorities continue to impose restrictions on public gatherings, human interactions, operations of businesses or mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures, restrict hours of operations or impose curfews, restrict the import or export of products or if suppliers issue mass recalls of products. Currently, several states and municipalities in the U.S. and abroad have temporarily suspended the operation of dining in at restaurants and instituted restrictions on public gatherings in light of COVID-19 which has caused venues such as professional sports venues, amusement parks, shopping malls and movie theaters to close temporarily. Additional regulation or requirements with respect to the compensation of the Company's employees and the employees of our business partners could also have an adverse effect on the Company's business. The implementation of such measures and if the virus or other disease continues to spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect the Company's business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 81225, "SIC": 3823, "TIC": "SMIT"}
