{"cik": "899923", "company": "MYRIAD GENETICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-08-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Strategy\nWe may not be successful in transitioning from our existing product portfolio to our new products, such as our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test, which represents the next generation of our existing hereditary cancer franchise. We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from our existing tests and our new tests or develop new tests to maintain profitability.\nAlthough we have developed and marketed several molecular diagnostic tests to date, we believe our future success is dependent upon our ability to successfully market our existing molecular diagnostic tests to additional patients within the United States, to expand into new markets outside the United States, and to develop and commercialize new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests. Importantly, in 2014 we launched our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test, which represents the next generation of our existing hereditary cancer testing franchise. We anticipate that the myRisk Hereditary Cancer test will eventually replace our current predictive medicine test offerings (BRACAnalysis, BART, Colaris and Colaris AP and Melaris) with a single comprehensive test. However, we may not be successful in transitioning from our existing product portfolio to our new tests and in launching and commercializing our new tests. The demand for our existing molecular diagnostic tests may decrease or may not continue to increase at historical rates due to sales of the myRisk Hereditary Cancer test and our other new tests that are replacing our existing product portfolio, or for other reasons. For example, because most of our molecular diagnostic tests are only utilized once per patient, we will need to sell our services through physicians to new patients or develop new molecular diagnostic tests in order to continue to generate revenue. Our pipeline of new molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic test candidates is in various stages of development and may take several more years to develop and must undergo extensive clinical validation. We may be unable to discover or develop any additional molecular diagnostic or companion diagnostic tests through the utilization of our technologies or technologies we license or acquire from others. Even if we develop tests or services for commercial use, we may not be able to develop tests or services that:\n\u2022\nmeet applicable regulatory standards, in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully compete with other technologies and tests;\n\u2022\navoid infringing the proprietary rights of others;\n\u2022\nare adequately reimbursed by third-party payors;\n\u2022\ncan be performed at commercial levels or at reasonable cost; or\n\u2022\ncan be successfully marketed.\nWe must generate significant revenue to maintain profitability. Even if we succeed in marketing myRisk Hereditary Cancer and our existing molecular diagnostic tests to physicians for use in new patients and in developing and commercializing any additional molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic tests, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to maintain profitability.\nWe may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nIn order to develop and commercialize our molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests, we expect to incur significant expenses over the next several years as we increase our research and development activities, expand clinical validation trials for our molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic tests currently in development, potentially license or acquire additional companies or technologies and engage in commercialization activities in anticipation of the launch of additional molecular diagnostic tests companion diagnostic tests. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our tests and their potential for commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any future profits. If we are unable to sustain or increase profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline. Our ability to maintain profitability will depend upon numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to transition from our existing product portfolio to our new products, such as our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test, and to commercialize these new tests;\n\u2022\nsuccessful outcomes of clinical trials (including but not limited to the GeneSight clinical trial);\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain full or partial reimbursement for new products;\n\u2022\nour ability to sell our other existing molecular diagnostic tests to new patients;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify biomarkers that may lead to future molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop test candidates and receive any required regulatory approvals, including FDA approval as may be required for existing tests if LDTs become FDA regulated or for new tests such as myChoice HRD testing or a kit version of EndoPredict;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize our tests in our existing markets and to extend into new markets outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe approval and introduction of competitive tests;\n\u2022\nreductions in reimbursement by third-party payors or their willingness to provide full or even partial reimbursement for our tests;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights covering our molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and grow our sales force and marketing team to market our tests;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate, develop and grow products and services and the business of any other companies or technologies that we may license or acquire;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase commercial acceptance of our current molecular diagnostic tests; and\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain or grow our current revenues.\nIf we do not continue to generate sufficient revenue from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests and are unable to secure additional funding, we may have to reduce our operations.\nAs of June 30, 2017, we had $199.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 our consolidated revenues were $771.4 million, and net cash from operating activities was $106.2 million. To develop and bring new molecular diagnostic tests and companion diagnostic tests to market, we must commit substantial resources to costly and time-consuming research, development testing and clinical testing. In addition, we entered into an unsecured revolving debt facility (the \u201cFacility) in December 2016, pursuant to which we borrowed a principal amount of $205.0 million. The Facility is due on December 23, 2021. As of June 30, 2017, the balance due under our Facility was $99.1 million.\nWhile we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and expected net cash to be generated from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests and pharmaceutical and clinical services will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the foreseeable future, changes could occur that would consume available capital resources more quickly than we currently expect and we may need or want to raise additional financing. If we are unable to secure additional funding, we may be unable to repay our Revolving Debt Facility when it becomes due, and be required to reduce research and development projects, limit sales and marketing activities, scale back our expansion efforts outside the United States, reduce headcount or potentially even discontinue operations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are currently unknown to us, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope, progress, results and cost of development, clinical testing and pre-market studies of any new molecular diagnostic tests that we may discover or acquire;\n\u2022\nthe progress, results, and costs to develop additional molecular diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our current issued patents, and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into collaborations, licensing or other arrangements favorable to us;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquiring technologies or businesses, and our ability to successfully integrate and achieve the expected benefits of our business development activities and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe progress, cost and results of our international expansion efforts;\n\u2022\nthe costs of expanding our sales and marketing functions and commercial operation facilities in the United States and in new markets;\n\u2022\nthe costs, timing and outcome of any litigation against us; and\n\u2022\nthe costs to satisfy our current and future obligations.\nWe are subject to debt covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and could limit our ability to grow our business.\nCovenants in the Facility, which went into effect during the quarter ending March 31, 2017, impose operating and financial restrictions on the Company. These restrictions may prohibit or place limitations on, among other things, the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create certain types of liens, mergers or consolidations, and/or change in control transactions. The Facility may also prohibit or place limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to sell assets, pay dividends or provide other distributions to shareholders. These restrictions could also limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities. The Company must maintain a specified leverage and interest ratios measured as of the end of each quarter as a financial covenant in the Facility. Our ability to comply with this ratio may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\nUnder the Facility, a change in control in our Company, which means that a shareholder or a group of shareholders is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 35% of the total voting power of the voting stock of the Company would require mandatory prepayment of the outstanding debt.\nIf we are unable to comply with the covenants and ratio in the Facility in the future, we may be in default under the agreement. A default would result in an increase in the rate of interest and may cause the loan repayment to be accelerated. This could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may acquire technologies, assets or other businesses that could cause us to incur significant expense and expose us to a number of unanticipated operational and financial risks.\nIn addition to organic growth, we intend to continue to pursue growth through the acquisition of technology, assets or other businesses that may enable us to enhance our technologies and capabilities, expand our geographic market, add experienced management personnel and increase our test offerings. For example, in May 2011, we completed the acquisition of Rules Based Medicine, Inc., which we renamed Myriad RBM, and are now offering pharmaceutical and clinical services and developing additional product candidates using the acquired technology. In February 2014, we completed the acquisition of Crescendo Bioscience, Inc., and are now offering molecular diagnostic tests for patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and developing additional product candidates in the inflammatory and autoimmune disease area. In February 2015, we acquired the Clinic and believe the acquisition may facilitate our penetration into the German molecular diagnostic market. In May 2016, we acquired Sividon Diagnostics GmbH. Now as a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sividon will continue to offer EndoPredict testing in the European market, which we offered under an exclusive distribution agreement with Sividon prior to the acquisition. Additionally, in August 2016, we acquired Assurex Health, Inc. and are now offering a molecular diagnostic test providing treatment decision support to healthcare providers for mental health patients. However, these acquisitions may not achieve profitability or generate a positive return on our investment. Additionally, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates, reach agreement on potential acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate personnel or assets that we acquire or for other reasons. Our acquisition efforts may involve certain risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty integrating operations and systems;\n\u2022\nkey personnel and customers of the acquired company may terminate their relationships with the acquired company as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may not be successful in launching new molecular diagnostic tests or companion diagnostic tests, or if those tests are launched they may not prove successful in the market place;\n\u2022\nwe may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning and financial reporting;\n\u2022\nwe may assume or be held liable for risks and liabilities, including for environmental-related costs, as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not discover during our due diligence;\n\u2022\nwe may incur significant additional operating expenses;\n\u2022\nour ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to realize synergies, the cost savings or other financial and operational benefits we anticipated, or such synergies, savings or benefits may take longer than we expected.\nThe process of negotiating acquisitions and integrating acquired tests, services, technologies, personnel or businesses might result in operating difficulties and expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be\navailable for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. Moreover, we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. Future acquisitions could result in the use of our available cash and marketable securities, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, tests or technologies effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that we acquire with our own or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions or develop or commercialize products based on recently acquired technologies, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any other companies, products or technologies that we acquire and may not realize all or any of the expected benefits of any acquisitions as and when planned. Additionally, we may experience increased expenses, distraction of our management, personnel and customer uncertainty.\nThe difficulties and risks associated with the integration of any other businesses that we may acquire include:\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in the standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures;\n\u2022\nthe increased scope and complexity of the acquired company\u2019s operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees and the costs associated to retain key employees;\n\u2022\nrisks and limitations on our ability to consolidate corporate and administrative infrastructures of the two companies; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of unanticipated delays, costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of our operations with the operations of any other companies that we may acquire.\nAs a result of these difficulties and risks, we may not accomplish the integration of the business of any companies we may acquire smoothly, successfully or within our budgetary expectations and anticipated timetable. Accordingly, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, such as increase in our scale, diversification, cash flows and operational efficiency and meaningful accretion to our diluted earnings per share.\nIf we were successfully sued for product liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the testing, marketing and processing of molecular diagnostic products, including possible misdiagnoses. Although we are insured against such risks in amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable, our present professional and product liability insurance may be inadequate. A successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on information technology, or IT, and telecommunications systems for significant aspects of our business. These IT and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including sample processing, tracking, quality control, customer service and support, billing, research and development activities, and various general and administrative activities. Failures or significant downtime of our IT or telecommunications systems could prevent us from processing samples, providing test results to physicians, billing payors, addressing patient or physician inquiries, conducting research and development activities and conducting general and administrative elements of our business. Any disruption or loss of IT or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, credit card information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, or viruses, breaches or interruptions due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed prevent, and if necessary to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. While we have experienced unauthorized accesses to our information technology systems and infrastructure in the past, which may occur again in the future, our security measures have been able to detect, respond to and prevent any material adverse effect to our information systems and business operations from such breaches. However, in the future, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to process samples, provide test results, bill payors or patients, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and may damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our current operating plan changes and we find that our existing capital resources will not meet our needs, we may find it necessary to raise additional funding, which may not be available.\nWe anticipate that our existing capital resources and expected net cash to be generated from sales of our molecular diagnostic tests will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations for the foreseeable future. However, we base this expectation on our current operating plan, which may change. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs in the discovery, development and marketing of current and prospective molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests. Our ongoing efforts to develop tests and expand our business which may be through internally developed products, in licensing and mergers and acquisitions will require substantial cash resources. If, due to changes in our current operating plan, adequate funds are not available, we may be required to raise additional funds. Sources of potential additional capital resources may include, but are not limited to, public or private equity financings, establishing a credit facility, or selling convertible or non-convertible debt securities. This additional funding, if necessary, may not be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. If we issue shares of stock or other securities to acquire new companies or technologies, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be significantly diluted.\nBecause of our potential long-term capital requirements, we may access the public or private equity or debt markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Under SEC rules, we currently qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer, or WKSI, and can at any time file a registration statement registering securities to be sold to the public which would become effective upon filing. If additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities, existing shareholders may suffer significant dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or tests, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur business involves environmental risks that may result in liability for us.\nIn connection with our research and development activities, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens, chemicals and wastes. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of controlled materials comply with the standards prescribed by\nstate and federal regulations, accidental contamination or injury from these materials may occur. In the event of such an occurrence, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nChanges in health care policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our tests.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or the ACA became law. This law substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollment in state and federal health care programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which will impact existing state and federal health care programs and will result in the development of new programs. The Trump administration supports a repeal of the ACA and an Executive Order was signed commanding federal agencies to try to waive or delay requirements of the ACA that impose economic or regulatory burdens on states, families, the health-care industry and others. The Executive Order also declares that the administration will seek the \u201cprompt repeal\u201d of the law and that the government should prepare to \u201cafford the States more flexibility and control to create a more free and open healthcare market.\u201d In addition, following the passage of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the ACA. Although it seems unlikely, the U.S. Senate could adopt the American Health Care Act as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives or other legislation to amend or replace elements of the ACA. It is uncertain whether the American Health Care Act will become law. At this time, the immediate impact of the Executive Order is not clear, and we cannot know how any legislation that may be passed to amend or replace the ACA will impact our business in the United States.\nIn addition to the ACA, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and private third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our tests or the amounts of reimbursement available for our tests from governmental agencies or private third-party payors.\nWe face risks associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe receive a portion of our revenues and pay a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the United States dollar, such as the Euro, the Swiss franc, the British pound, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. As a result, we are at risk for exchange rate fluctuations between such foreign currencies and the United States dollar, which could affect the results of our operations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in decreased revenues and operating expenses. We may not be able to offset adverse foreign currency impact with increased revenues. We do not currently utilize hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk and even if we were to implement hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies might not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Tests, Our Services and Test Candidates\nWe generate most of our revenues from three products and we may not be able to maintain revenue growth and profitability.\nWe may not be able to generate revenue growth or maintain existing revenue levels. Presently, our molecular diagnostic business operates profitably providing a cash contribution to our current funding and operational needs. We may not, however, be able to continue to operate our molecular diagnostic business on a profitable basis. We launched our first molecular diagnostic test, BRACAnalysis, our test for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, in November 1996. BRACAnalysis test sales accounted for approximately 9% of our revenues for the year ended June 30, 2017, and this percentage has been declining in recent years as we transition to our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test. An interruption or cessation of BRACAnalysis sample flow would have a material impact on our revenues and future profitability. In 2014 we launched our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test, which represents the next generation of our existing hereditary cancer franchise. We may not be successful in transitioning from our existing product portfolio to our new products, such as myRisk Hereditary Cancer Test, and in commercializing these tests over time. Other potential events or factors that may have a significant impact on our ability to sustain revenue growth and profitability for our molecular diagnostic business include the following:\n\u2022\nincreased costs of reagents and other consumables required for molecular diagnostic testing;\n\u2022\nincreased personnel and facility costs;\n\u2022\nour inability to hire competent, trained staff, including laboratory directors required to review and approve all reports we issue in our molecular diagnostic business, and sales personnel;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain necessary equipment or reagents to perform molecular diagnostic testing;\n\u2022\nour inability to increase production capacity as demand increases;\n\u2022\nour inability to expand into new markets outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe efforts of third party payors to limit or decrease the amounts that they are willing to pay for our tests;\n\u2022\nincreased licensing or royalty costs, and our ability to maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights underlying our tests and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in intellectual propriety law applicable to our patents or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\npotential obsolescence of our tests;\n\u2022\nour inability to increase commercial acceptance of our molecular diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nincreased competition and loss of market share; and\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory requirements.\nOur international business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have expanded into international markets. We have established sales offices in Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada and Australia; laboratory operations in Germany; and international headquarters in Switzerland. We may establish additional operations or acquire additional properties outside the United States in order to advance our international sales doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nfailure by us to obtain regulatory approvals or adequate reimbursement for the use of our tests in various countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nmanaging multiple payor reimbursement and self-pay systems;\n\u2022\nlogistics and regulations associated with shipping patient samples, including infrastructure conditions and transportation delays;\n\u2022\nlimits in our ability to penetrate international markets if we are not able to process tests locally;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, data and privacy laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, anti-boycott and other laws.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our international operations and, consequently, our revenues and results of operations. In addition, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities.\nOur international operations could be affected by changes in laws, trade regulations, labor and employment regulations, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of tests, as well as by inter-governmental disputes. Any of these changes could adversely affect our business.\nOur success internationally will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries in which we do business. Failure to manage these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole.\nForeign governments may impose reimbursement standards, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nWe market our tests in foreign jurisdictions and as such may be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our testing. In some foreign countries, including countries in the European Union, the reimbursement of diagnostic tests is subject to governmental control. In these countries, reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a test candidate. If reimbursement of our future tests is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if reimbursement rates are set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may experience increased price competition and price erosion.\nWe may experience pricing pressures from managed care organizations and other private third-party payors in the future. Any declines in average selling prices of our products due to pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur pharmaceutical testing services customers may reduce the amount of testing they conduct through us.\nIf there is a change in the regulatory environment or intellectual property law, or our pharmaceutical testing services customers consolidate, our customers may divert resources from testing, resulting in a reduced demand for our laboratory testing services. Alternatively, customers may decide to perform their own laboratory testing services in-house.\nWe rely on a single laboratory facility to process each of our molecular diagnostic tests in the United States and Europe and a single laboratory facility to perform our pharmaceutical and clinical services. Failure to maintain the operations of these laboratories in compliance with applicable regulations would seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on a CLIA-certified and FDA approved laboratory facility in Salt Lake City, Utah to perform most of our molecular diagnostic tests; a CLIA-certified laboratory in South San Francisco, California to perform our VectraDA test; a single laboratory facility in Munich, Germany to perform our international molecular diagnostic tests; a CLIA-certified lab in Mason, Ohio to perform our GeneSight test; and a CLIA-certified laboratory facility in Austin, Texas to perform our pharmaceutical and clinical testing services. These facilities and certain pieces of laboratory equipment would be difficult to replace and may require significant replacement lead-time. In the event our clinical testing facilities were to lose their CLIA certification or other required certifications or licenses or were affected by a man-made or natural disaster, we would be unable to continue our molecular diagnostic and pharmaceutical and clinical services business at current levels to meet customer demands for a significant period of time. Although we maintain insurance on these facilities, including business interruption insurance, it may not be adequate to protect us from all potential losses if these facilities were damaged or destroyed. In addition, any interruption in our molecular diagnostic or pharmaceutical and clinical services business would result in a loss of goodwill, including damage to our reputation. If our molecular diagnostic or pharmaceutical and clinical services business were interrupted, it would seriously harm our business.\nWe depend on a limited number of third parties for some of our supplies of equipment and reagents. If these supplies become unavailable, then we may not be able to successfully perform our research or operate our business on a timely basis or at all.\nWe currently rely on a small number of suppliers to provide our gene sequencing equipment, content enrichment equipment, multiplex protein analysis equipment, robots, and specialty reagents and laboratory supplies required in connection with our testing and research. We believe that currently there are limited alternative suppliers of these equipment, robots, and reagents. The equipment, robots, or the reagents may not remain available in commercial quantities at acceptable costs. If we are unable to obtain when needed additional or alternative equipment, robots, or an adequate supply of reagents or other ingredients at commercially reasonable rates, our ability to continue to identify genes and perform molecular diagnostic testing and pharmaceutical and clinical services would be adversely affected.\nOur molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests in development may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nWe may not succeed in achieving significant commercial market acceptance of our diagnostic test and clinical service offerings that we have launched in recent years or are currently developing. Our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our current molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests, as well as any future molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests that we may develop, will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to convince the medical community of the clinical utility of our tests and their potential advantages over existing tests;\n\u2022\nour ability to collaborate with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize companion diagnostic tests for their therapeutic drugs and drug candidates;\n\u2022\nthe agreement by third-party payors to reimburse our tests, the scope and extent of which will affect patients\u2019 willingness or ability to pay for our tests and will likely heavily influence physicians\u2019 decisions to recommend our tests; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians to utilize our tests, which can be difficult to interpret. This difficulty is caused by the ability of our tests to predict only as to a probability, not certainty, that a tested individual will develop, have the disease, benefit from a particular therapy or has an aggressive form of the disease that the test is intended to predict.\nThese factors present obstacles to commercial acceptance of our tests, which we would have to spend substantial time and money to overcome, if we can do so at all. Our inability to successfully do so would harm our business.\nIf we do not compete effectively with scientific and commercial competitors, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our tests.\nThe clinical laboratory and genetics testing fields are intense and highly competitive. Tests that are developed are characterized by rapid technological change. Our competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include, among others, major diagnostic companies, reference laboratories, molecular diagnostic firms, universities and other research institutions. Some of our potential competitors have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, which may allow these competitors to discover important genes and determine their function before we do. We could be adversely affected if we do not discover genes, proteins or biomarkers and characterize their function, develop molecular diagnostic and pharmaceutical and clinical services based on these discoveries, obtain required regulatory and other approvals and launch these tests and their related services before our competitors. We also expect to encounter significant competition with respect to any molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests that we may develop or commercialize. Those companies that bring to market new molecular diagnostic and companion tests before we do may achieve a significant competitive advantage in marketing and commercializing their tests. We may not be able to develop additional molecular diagnostic tests successfully and we or our licensors may not obtain or enforce patents covering these tests that provide protection against our competitors. Moreover, our competitors may succeed in developing molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests that circumvent our technologies or tests. Furthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing technologies or tests that are more effective or less costly than those developed by us or that would render our technologies or tests less competitive or obsolete. We expect competition to intensify in the fields in which we are involved as technical advances in these fields occur and become more widely known and changes in intellectual property laws generate challenges to our intellectual property position.\nIf our current research collaborators or scientific advisors terminate their relationships with us or develop relationships with a competitor, our ability to discover genes, proteins, and biomarkers, and to validate and commercialize molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests could be adversely affected.\nWe have relationships with research collaborators at academic and other institutions who conduct research at our request. These research collaborators are not our employees. As a result, we have limited control over their activities and, except as otherwise required by our collaboration agreements, can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities. Our ability to discover genes, proteins, and biomarkers involved in human disease and validate and commercialize molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests will depend in part on the continuation of these collaborations. If any of these collaborations are terminated, we may not be able to enter into other acceptable collaborations. In addition, our existing collaborations may not be successful.\nOur research collaborators and scientific advisors may have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which could compete with us. Our research collaborators and scientific advisors sign agreements which provide for the confidentiality of our\nproprietary information and the results of studies conducted at our request. We may not, however, be able to maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information related to all collaborations. The dissemination of our confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel and hire, train and retain qualified employees and consultants, we may not be able to successfully continue our business.\nBecause of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, scientific and technical personnel. We are currently recruiting additional qualified management, scientific and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. Loss of the services of or failure to recruit additional key management, scientific and technical personnel would adversely affect our research and development programs and molecular diagnostic and pharmaceutical and clinical services business and may have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole.\nOur agreements with our employees generally provide for employment that can be terminated by either party without cause at any time, subject to specified notice requirements. Further, the non-competition provision to which each employee is subject expires for certain key employees on the applicable date of termination of employment.\nAs we expand our commercial tests we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to expand our existing tests sales and marketing capabilities.\nOur sales and marketing experience and capabilities consist primarily of our sales force that markets our molecular diagnostic tests to oncologists, obstetricians, gynecologists, urologists, dermatopathologists and rheumatologists in the United States. We are currently expanding our sales efforts outside the United States, which will require us to hire additional personnel and engage in additional sales and marketing efforts. We have limited sales and marketing experience outside the Unites States. As we expand our business operations internationally, we expect to face a number of additional costs and risks, including the need to recruit a large number of additional experienced marketing and sales personnel.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary technology, others could compete against us more directly, which would harm our business.\nAs of June 30, 2017, our patent portfolio included issued patents owned or licensed by us and numerous patent applications in the United States and other countries with claims protecting our intellectual property rights. Our commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain additional patents and licenses and protect our existing patent position, both in the United States and in other countries, for compositions, processes, methods and other inventions that we believe are patentable. Our ability to preserve our trade secrets, proprietary data bases and other intellectual property is also important to our long-term success. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to maintain profitability. Patents may also issue to third parties which could interfere with our ability to bring our molecular diagnostic tests to market. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries.\nThe patent positions of diagnostic companies, including our patent position, are generally highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, any patents issued to us may be challenged, deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and any future tests are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our patent applications may never issue as patents, and the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technology or tests. In addition, any patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged, and subsequently narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.\nWhere necessary, we may initiate litigation to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. Any such litigation may require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from our day-to-day operations. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u2022\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable tests, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies or tests that are patentable;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business; or\n\u2022\nour patents or patents that we license from others will survive legal challenges, and remain valid and enforceable.\nIf a third party files a patent application with claims to subject matter we have invented, the PTO may declare interference between competing patent applications. If an interference is declared, we may not prevail in the interference. If the other party prevails in the interference, we may be precluded from commercializing services or tests based on the invention or may be required to seek a license. A license may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary technologies and databases. Although we require employees, consultants and collaborators to sign confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our rights in such unpatented proprietary technologies and databases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technologies or disclose our technologies to our competitors.\nIf we were sued for patent infringement by third parties, we might incur significant costs and delays in test introduction.\nOur tests may also conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to others. Our industry includes many organizations that have or are seeking to discern biomarkers and develop genomic, proteomic and other technologies. To the extent any patents are issued or have been issued to those organizations, the risk increases that the sale of our molecular diagnostic and companion diagnostic tests currently being marketed or under development may give rise to claims of patent infringement. Others may have filed and in the future are likely to file patent applications covering biomarkers that are similar or identical to our tests. Any of these patent applications may have priority over our patent applications and these entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against us seeking damages or seeking to enjoin us from testing or marketing our tests. Patent litigation is costly, and even if we prevail, the cost of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on us. If the other parties in any such actions are successful, in addition to any liability for damages, we could be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our tests could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become involved in this litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets, proprietary databases, and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies and databases, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and others to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy if unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurs. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under license or technology agreements with third parties, we could lose license rights that are critical to our business.\nWe license intellectual property that is important to our business, including licenses underlying the technology in our molecular diagnostic and pharmaceutical and clinical services, and in the future we may enter into additional agreements that provide us\nwith licenses to valuable intellectual property or technology. These licenses impose various royalty payments, milestones, and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. Termination by the licensor would cause us to lose valuable rights, and could prevent us from distributing our current tests, or inhibit our ability to commercialize future test candidates. Our business would suffer if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensors fail to prevent infringement by third parties, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations currently include, among other things:\n\u2022\nCLIA, which requires that laboratories obtain certification from the federal government, and state licensure laws;\n\u2022\nFDA laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which imposes comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions; amendments to HIPAA under HITECH, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general and impose requirements for breach notification;\n\u2022\nstate laws regulating genetic testing and protecting the privacy of genetic test results, as well as state laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data and mandating reporting of breaches to affected individuals and state regulators;\n\u2022\nthe federal anti-kickback law, or the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies;\n\u2022\nother federal and state fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device manufactures to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nSection 216 of the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d), which requires applicable laboratories to report private payer data in a timely and accurate manner beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (and in some cases annually);\n\u2022\nstate laws that impose reporting and other compliance-related requirements; and\n\u2022\nsimilar foreign laws and regulations that apply to us in the countries in which we operate.\nThese laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. Our failure to comply could lead to civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in state and federal health care programs, or prohibitions or restrictions on our laboratories\u2019 ability to provide or receive payment for our services. We believe that we are in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, but there is a risk that one or more government agencies could take a contrary position, or that a private party could file suit under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act or a similar state law. Such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties, including managed care organizations, and other private third-party payors.\nFailure to comply with government laws and regulations related to submission of claims for our services could result in significant monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and corresponding foreign reimbursement programs.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the submission of claims for payment for our services, such as those relating to: coverage of our services under Medicare, Medicaid and other state, federal and foreign health care programs; the amounts that we may bill for our services; and the party to which we must submit claims. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in our inability to receive payment for our services or in attempts by state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to recover payments already made. Submission of claims in violation of these laws and regulations can result in recoupment of payments already received, substantial civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from state and federal health care programs, and can subject us to liability under the federal False Claims Act and similar laws. The failure to report and return an overpayment to the Medicare or Medicaid program within 60 days of identifying its existence can give rise to liability under the False Claims Act. Further, a government agency could attempt to hold us liable for causing the improper submission of claims by another entity for services that we performed if we were found to have knowingly participated in the arrangement at issue.\nOur business could be harmed by the loss, suspension, or other restriction on a license, certification, or accreditation, or by the imposition of a fine or penalties, under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or other state, federal and foreign laws and regulations affecting licensure or certification, or by future changes in these laws or regulations.\nThe diagnostic testing industry is subject to extensive laws and regulations, many of which have not been interpreted by the courts. CLIA requires virtually all laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private third-party payors, for laboratory testing services. As a condition of CLIA certification, each of our laboratories is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by CMS; a CMS agent (typically a state agency); or, if the laboratory holds a CLIA certificate of accreditation, a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements, including proficiency testing violations, may include suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as the imposition of significant fines or criminal penalties. In addition, we are subject to regulation under state laws and regulations governing laboratory licensure. Some states have enacted state licensure laws that are more stringent than CLIA. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing our reference laboratory in Germany. Changes in state or foreign licensure laws that affect our ability to offer and provide diagnostic services across state or foreign country lines could materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, state and foreign requirements for laboratory certification may be costly or difficult to meet and could affect our ability to receive specimens from certain states or foreign countries.\nAny sanction imposed under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure, or our failure to renew a CLIA certificate, a state or foreign license, or accreditation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the CLIA certificate of any one of our laboratories is revoked, CMS could seek revocation of the CLIA certificates of our other laboratories based on their common ownership or operation, even though they are separately certified.\nChanges in the way that the FDA regulates tests performed by laboratories like ours could result in delay or additional expense in offering our tests and tests that we may develop in the future.\nHistorically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion with respect to most LDTs and has not required laboratories that furnish LDTs to comply with the agency\u2019s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls). In recent years, however, the FDA publicly announced its intention to regulate certain LDTs and issued two draft guidance documents that set forth a proposed phased-in risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. However, these guidance documents were withdrawn at the end of the Obama administration and replaced by an informal discussion paper reflecting some of the feedback that FDA had received on LDT regulation. The FDA acknowledged that the discussion paper in January 2017 that the FDA stated does not represent the formal position of the FDA and is not enforceable. Nevertheless, the FDA wanted to share its synthesis of the feedback that it had received in the hope that it might advance public discussion on future LDT oversight. Notwithstanding the discussion paper, the FDA continues to exercise enforcement discretion and may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time, which could result in delay or additional expense in offering our tests and tests that we may develop in the future.\nCompanion and complementary diagnostic tests require FDA approval and we may not be able to secure such approval in a timely manner or at all.\nOur companion and complementary diagnostic products, marketing, sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, companion diagnostics must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products could:\n\u2022\ntake a significant period of time;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve rigorous pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;\n\u2022\nrequire changes to products; and\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the indicated uses of products.\nAlthough we obtained FDA approval for our BRACAnalysis CDx test, which is used as a companion diagnostic to identify ovarian cancer patients who may benefit from AstraZeneca\u2019s PARP inhibitor Lynparza\u2122 (olaparib) and as a complementary diagnostic in ovarian cancer patients associated with enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) from Tesaro\u2019s PARP inhibitor Zejula\u2122 (niraparib) maintenance therapy, we cannot predict whether or when we will be able to obtain FDA approval for other companion diagnostics that we are developing.\nIf the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate payment for our tests and future tests, if any, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be harmed.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our molecular diagnostic tests or any future diagnostic tests will depend in large part, upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include state and federal health care programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both coverage on which diagnostic tests they will pay for and the amounts that they will pay for new molecular diagnostic tests. We have recently experienced price reductions from CMS for some of our products and may experience future price reductions from managed care organizations and other third-party payors. The fact that a diagnostic test has been approved for reimbursement in the past, for any particular indication or in any particular jurisdiction, does not guarantee that such a diagnostic test will remain approved for reimbursement or that similar or additional diagnostic tests will be approved in the future. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any new tests we launch, such as myRisk Hereditary Cancer, myPath Melanoma and myPlan Lung Cancer, will be reimbursed at rates that are comparable to the rates that we historically obtained for our existing product portfolio. As a result, third-party payors may not cover or provide adequate payment for our current or future molecular diagnostic tests. Adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Further, beginning in 2018 under PAMA, Medicare reimbursement for any given diagnostic test will be based on the weighted-median of the payments made by private payors for such test, rendering private payor payment levels even more significant. As a result, future Medicare\npayments may fluctuate more often and become subject to the willingness of private payors to recognize the value of diagnostic tests generally and any given test individually.\nU.S. and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of health care. For example, in some foreign markets, the government controls the pricing of many health care products. We expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls or impose health care requirements. In addition, the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on product pricing. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we would receive for any tests in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by our failure or the failure of physicians to comply with the ICD-10-CM Code Set.\nCMS adopted a new coding set for diagnoses, commonly known as ICD-10-CM, which significantly expanded the previous coding set. Compliance with ICD-10-CM is required for all claims with dates of service on or after October 1, 2015. We believe we have fully implemented ICD-10-CM, however, our failure to implement and apply the new code set could adversely impact our business. In addition, if physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for desired tests, we may not be reimbursed for tests we perform.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is highly volatile, and our stock may lose all or a significant part of its value.\nThe market prices for securities of molecular diagnostic companies have been volatile. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices for these securities for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly since public trading commenced in October 1995, and it is likely that the market price will continue to fluctuate in the future. In the two years ended June 30, 2017, our stock price has ranged from $15.15 per share to $46.24 per share. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Events or factors that may have a significant impact on our business and on the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our recently launched tests and any new test candidates to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nfailure to sustain revenue growth or margins in our molecular diagnostic business;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems and changes in the governmental or private insurers reimbursement levels for our molecular diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new commercial tests or technological innovations by competitors;\n\u2022\ntermination of the licenses underlying our molecular diagnostic and pharmaceutical and clinical services;\n\u2022\ndelays or other problems with operating our laboratory facilities;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nchanges in intellectual property laws of our patents or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights involving us directly or otherwise affecting the industry as a whole;\n\u2022\nmissing or changing the financial guidance we provide;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts relating to our common stock or the securities of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the governmental regulatory approved process for our existing and new tests:\n\u2022\nfailure to meet estimates or recommendations by securities analysts that cover our common stock;\n\u2022\npublic concern over our approved tests and any test candidates;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or anticipated sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of repurchases of our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\nseasonal slowness in sales, particularly in the quarters ending September 30 and March 31, the effects of which may be difficult to understand during periods of growth;\n\u2022\ncelebrity publicity;\n\u2022\neconomic, healthcare and diagnostic trends, disasters or crises and other external factors; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nThese and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, securities class action litigation against companies has been on the rise. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit regardless of the outcome. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws and re-adoption of our stockholders\u2019 rights plan, or poison pill, could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nBecause we are a Delaware corporation, the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, which prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws also contain certain provisions that may make a third-party acquisition of us difficult, including:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors, with three classes of directors each serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\na 70% super-majority shareholder vote to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting or act by written consent.\nIn the past, we implemented a stockholders\u2019 rights plan, also called a poison pill, which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire our company on a hostile basis. Although the plan expired in July 2011, our Board of Directors could adopt a new plan at any time. The provisions in a stockholders\u2019 rights plan, as well as Section 203, may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market price, and may limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interests.", "PERMNO": 82508, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "MYGN"}
