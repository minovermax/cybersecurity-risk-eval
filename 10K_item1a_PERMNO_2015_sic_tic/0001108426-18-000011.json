RISK FACTORS\nThe business and financial results of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control, including those set forth below and in MD&A, Note 16, and Note 17. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement contained in this report, see Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Item 1. Business. TNMP provides transmission and distribution services to REPs that provide electric service to consumers in TNMP\u2019s service territories. References to customers in the risk factors discussed below also encompass the customers of these REPs who are the ultimate consumers of electricity transmitted and distributed through TNMP\u2019s facilities.\nRegulatory Factors\nThe profitability of PNMR\u2019s utilities depends on being able to recover their costs through regulated rates and earn a fair return on invested capital, including investments in its generating plants. PNM and TNMP are in a period of significant capital expenditures, including costs of replacing generating capacity as coal-fired plants are retired. While increased capital investments and other costs are placing upward pressure on rates, energy efficiency initiatives and a sluggish New Mexico economy are reducing usage by customers.\nA - 13\nThe rates PNM charges its customers are regulated by the NMPRC and FERC. TNMP is regulated by the PUCT. The Company is in a period requiring significant capital investment and is projecting total construction expenditures for the years 2018-2022 to be $2,712.1 million. See Note 14. PNM and TNMP anticipate a trend toward increasing costs, for which it will have to seek regulatory recovery. These costs include or are related to:\n\u2022\nCosts of asset construction for generation, transmission, and distribution systems necessary to provide electric service, including new generation and transmission resources, as well as the cost to remove and retire existing assets\n\u2022\nEnvironmental compliance expenditures\n\u2022\nThe regulatory mandate to acquire power from renewable resources\n\u2022\nIncreased regulation related to nuclear safety\n\u2022\nIncreased interest costs to finance capital investments\n\u2022\nDepreciation\nAt the same time costs are increasing, there are factors placing downward pressures on the demand for power, thereby reducing load growth and customer usage. These factors include:\n\u2022\nChanging customer behaviors, including increased emphasis on energy efficiency measures and utilization of alternative sources of power\n\u2022\nRate design that is not driven by economics, which could influence customer behavior\n\u2022\nUnfavorable economic conditions\n\u2022\nReductions in costs of self-generation energy resources and energy efficiency technology\n\u2022\nReduced new sources of demand\n\u2022\nUnpredictable weather patterns\nIn 2017 and 2016, PNM experienced decreases in weather-normalized retail sales of 0.9% and 0.7%. The sales decreases reflect a continued sluggish economy in New Mexico. However, economic conditions in Albuquerque appear to have stabilized. The Albuquerque metro area is showing employment growth, although it continues to be lower than the national average. The economy in New Mexico continues to have mixed indicators and experience softness.\nThe combination of costs increasing relatively rapidly and the slowing of customer usage places upward pressure on the per unit prices that must be charged to recover costs. This upward pressure on unit prices could result in additional efforts by customers to reduce consumption through energy efficiency or to pursue self-generation or other alternative sources of power. Without timely cost recovery and the authorization to earn a reasonable return on invested capital, the Company\u2019s liquidity and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nUnder New Mexico law, utilities may propose the use of a future test year (\u201cFTY\u201d) in establishing rates. As with any forward looking financial information, a FTY presents challenges that are inherent in the forecasting process. Forecasts of both operating and capital expenditures necessitate reliance on many assumptions concerning future conditions and operating results. Accordingly, if rate requests based on a FTY cannot be successfully supported, cash flows and results of operations may be negatively impacted. This could result from not being able to withstand challenges from regulators and intervenors regarding the utility\u2019s capability to make reasonable forecasts.\nAs discussed in Note 17, PNM filed an application for a general rate increase in December 2014, which the NMPRC dismissed in May 2015, based on the Hearing Examiners recommendation, which cited procedural defects in the filing. In August 2015, PNM filed a new application (the \u201cNM 2015 Rate Case\u201d) with the NMPRC for a general rate increase, including base non-fuel revenues of $121.5 million. The primary drivers of PNM\u2019s identified revenue deficiency were infrastructure investments and the recovery of those investment dollars, including depreciation based on an updated depreciation study, and declines in forecasted energy sales as a result of PNM\u2019s successful energy efficiency programs and other economic factors. The NMPRC issued an order authorizing an increase in non-fuel revenues of $61.2 million effective beginning in October 2016. The NMPRC disallowed recovery of PNM\u2019s capital investment in BDT equipment installed on SJGS Units 1 and 4, which is required by the NSR permit for SJGS (Note 16), and a portion of the acquisition costs for PNM\u2019s January 15, 2016 purchase of 64.1 MW of PVNGS Unit 2, which were previously leased to PNM, as well as the undepreciated costs of capitalized improvements made during the period that capacity was leased. PNM filed an appeal of these disallowances with the NM Supreme Court. Other parties to that rate case have filed cross-appeals to PNM\u2019s appeal in order to appeal other decisions of the NMPRC regarding issues in the rate case. On October 30, 2017, the NM Supreme Court heard oral argument on the case, but has not yet rendered a decision on the appealed matters and there is no required time frame for a decision to be issued.\nIn December 2016, PNM filed a request (the \u201cNM 2016 Rate Case\u201d) for a general increase in rates of $99.2 million. The primary drivers of PNM\u2019s identified revenue deficiency were implementation of the plan for SJGS to comply with the CAA,\nA - 14\nincluding the shutdown of Units 2 and 3 of SJGS, recovery of 50% of the net book value of those units, and the inclusion in retail rates of PVNGS Unit 3 as replacement power (Note 16). The requested increase also reflected new infrastructure investments, including the installation of SCRs at Four Corners, and declines in forecasted energy sales as a result of PNM\u2019s successful energy efficiency programs and other economic factors. PNM also proposed changes in rate design to better align electric rates with the actual costs to serve customers and encourage continued energy efficiency while proposing a rate mechanism that eliminates the disincentives associated with energy efficiency and load management programs. On May 23, 2017, PNM and several signatories filed a revised comprehensive stipulation, which reduced the non-fuel revenue increase to $62.3 million and provided that PNM would only earn a debt return on its investments in SCR technology at Four Corners. In January 2018, the NMPRC issued an order, which approved many aspects of the revised comprehensive stipulation with several modifications. These modifications include a requirement for PNM to reflect the impacts of recently enacted federal tax reform in rates beginning in 2018, a disallowance of PNM\u2019s ability to collect an equity return on its $90.1 million investment in SCRs at Four Corners and on $58.0 million of projected additional capital improvements at Four Corners, and a requirement that PNM reduce the $62.3 million non-fuel revenue requested increase by $4.4 million. The NMPRC deferred further consideration regarding the prudency of PNM\u2019s continuation of participation in Four Corners to PNM\u2019s next rate case. On February 7, 2018, NEE filed a notice of appeal with the NM Supreme Court asking the court to review the NMPRC\u2019s decisions in the NM 2016 Rate Case.\nAs discussed in Note 17, PNM filed its 2017 IRP on July 3, 2017. Key findings of the 2017 IRP include that retiring PNM\u2019s share of SJGS in 2022 after the expiration of the current operating and coal supply agreements would provide long-term cost savings for PNM\u2019s customers and that PNM exiting its ownership interest in Four Corners after its current coal supply agreement expires in 2031 would also provide long-term cost savings for customers. Retiring PNM\u2019s share of SJGS capacity and exiting Four Corners would require NMPRC approval of abandonment filings, which PNM would make at appropriate times in the future. NMPRC approval of new generation resources through CCN filings would also be required. The NMPRC has issued regulatory orders requiring depreciation (and resultant regulatory recovery) of significant portions of these resources through estimated lives of 2053 for SJGS and 2041 for Four Corners. If the NMPRC approves the retirement of SJGS in 2022 and exiting Four Corners in 2031, PNM will have significant un-recovered investments in those plants. PNM would seek NMPRC approval to recover those investments from ratepayers. At December 31, 2017, the net book values of PNM\u2019s investments in SJGS and Four Corners were $406.7 million and $165.3 million.\nAn adverse outcome in the NM 2015 Rate Case or the NM 2016 Rate Case, including the pending appeals of those orders before the NM Supreme Court, or the decision in PNM\u2019s next rate case on the issue regarding the prudency of PNM\u2019s continued participation in Four Corners could negatively impact PNM\u2019s financial position, results of operation, and cash flows. Likewise, if the NMPRC does not authorize appropriate recovery of any remaining investments in SJGS and Four Corners at the time those resources cease to be used to provide service to New Mexico ratepayers, including required future investments, and does not authorize recovery of the costs of obtaining power to replace those resources, PNM\u2019s financial position, results of operation, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nPNM currently recovers the cost of fuel for its generation facilities through its FPPAC. A new coal supply contract for SJGS, which expires on June 30, 2022, became effective on January 31, 2016 and provides for lower coal pricing than under the prior contract. In December 2013, a new fifteen-year coal supply contract for Four Corners beginning in July 2016 was executed. The average coal price per MMBTU under the new contract for Four Corners was approximately 51% higher in the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 than in the twelve months ended June 30, 2016. The contracts provide for pricing adjustments over their terms based on economic indices. Although PNM believes substantially all costs under coal supply arrangements would continue to be recovered through the FPPAC, there can be no assurance that full recovery will be allowed.\nPNM\u2019s regulatory approvals from the NMPRC, which are necessary for PNM to comply with the regional haze requirements of the CAA pertaining to SJGS, have been appealed to the NM Supreme Court. Furthermore, the NMPRC approval requires PNM to make a filing in 2018 to determine the extent to which SJGS should continue to serve PNM\u2019s retail customers after June 30, 2022, on which date the SJPPA and the current coal supply agreement will expire. PNMR has counterparty credit risk in connection with financial support provided to facilitate the coal supply arrangement for SJGS. Adverse developments from these factors could have a negative impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of PNM and PNMR.\nSJGS, which currently comprises 26.7% of PNM\u2019s owned and leased generation capacity and is its largest generation resource, is subject to the CAA. As discussed in Note 16, in December 2015, the NMPRC approved a plan enabling SJGS to comply with the CAA (the \u201cBART Approval\u201d). The plan required the shutdown of SJGS Units 2 and 3 by December 31, 2017 and the shutdown was completed by that date. NEE, an intervenor in the NMPRC proceeding regarding the approval of the plan, has appealed the BART Approval to the NM Supreme Court. NEE has also filed a complaint with the NMPRC against PNM regarding the financing provided by NM Capital, a subsidiary of PNMR, to facilitate the sale of SJCC, which is discussed below and described under Coal Supply in Note 16. The complaint alleges that PNM failed to comply with its discovery obligation in\nA - 15\nthe SJGS abandonment case and requests the NMPRC to investigate whether the financing transactions could adversely affect PNM\u2019s ability to provide electric service to its retail customers. The NMPRC has taken no action on this matter. If the NM Supreme Court were to negate the BART Approval, it is unclear what the impact would be since SJGS Units 2 and 3 have been retired and ownership of SJGS has been restructured.\nThe BART Approval also requires PNM to make a filing with the NMPRC no later than December 31, 2018, and before entering into an agreement for post-2022 coal supply for SJGS, setting forth its position in a case to determine the extent to which SJGS should continue serving PNM\u2019s retail customers\u2019 needs after mid-2022. The existing SJPPA among the SJGS participants, which governs the operations of SJGS, expires on July 1, 2022 and the new SJGS CSA for coal supply at SJGS described in Note 16 expires on June 30, 2022. PNM has the option to extend the SJGS CSA, subject to negotiation of the term of the extension and compensation to the miner. In order to extend, PNM must give written notice of that intent to the miner by July 1, 2018 and the parties must agree to the terms of the extension by January 1, 2019.\nAs discussed in Note 17, PNM\u2019s 2017 IRP indicates that retiring PNM\u2019s share of SJGS in 2022 after the expiration of the current operating and coal supply agreements and exiting ownership in Four Corners after the current coal supply agreement expires in 2031 would provide long-term cost savings for PNM\u2019s customers. The 2017 IRP addresses a 20-year planning period, from 2017 through 2036, and includes an action plan describing PNM\u2019s plan to implement the 2017 IRP in the four-year period following its filing.\nThe restructuring of SJGS ownership and obtaining the new coal supply for SJGS were integral components of the process to achieve compliance with the CAA at SJGS. The effectiveness of the new SJGS CSA was dependent on the closing of the purchase of the existing coal mine operation by a new mine operator. In support of the closing of the mine purchase, NM Capital provided a loan of $125.0 million to the purchaser, which has been organized to be a bankruptcy-remote entity. In addition, PNMR has an arrangement with a bank under which the bank has issued $30.3 million of letters of credit in favor of sureties in order for the sureties to post reclamation bonds that are required under the mine\u2019s operating permit. See Note 6 and Note 16.\nThe inability to operate SJGS or Four Corners or their early retirement would require approval of the NMPRC and would require PNM to obtain power from other sources in order to serve the needs of its customers. There can be no assurance that the NMPRC would approve early retirement or that recovery of any undepreciated investments through rates charged to customers would be authorized. In addition, there can be no assurance that adequate sources of replacement power would be available, that adequate transmission capabilities would be available to bring that power into PNM\u2019s service territory, or whether the cost of obtaining those resources would be economic. Any such events would negatively impact PNM\u2019s financial position, results of operation, and cash flows unless the NMPRC authorized the collection from customers of any un-recovered costs related to SJGS and Four Corners, as well as costs of obtaining replacement power.\nIt is also possible that unsatisfactory outcomes of these matters, the financial impact of climate change regulation or legislation, other environmental regulations, the result of litigation, the adequacy and timeliness of cost recovery mechanisms, and other business considerations, could jeopardize the economic viability of SJGS and/or Four Corners or the ability of individual participants to continue participation in them.\nPNMR\u2019s utilities are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, which may impose significant compliance costs and may significantly limit or affect their operations and financial results.\nEnvironmental policies and regulations remain significant concerns for PNMR. Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those addressing climate change, air quality, CCBs, discharges of wastewater originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities, cooling water, and other matters, may result in increased capital, operating, and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emission obligations. These costs could include remediation, containment, civil liability, and monitoring expenses. The Company cannot predict how it would be affected if existing environmental laws and regulations were to be repealed, revised, or reinterpreted, or if new environmental statutes and rules were to be adopted. See Note 16 and the Climate Change Issues subsection of the Other Issues Facing the Company section of MD&A.\nUnder the Obama Administration, EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan mandated standards of performance that would limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. Individual states would develop and implement plans to ensure compliance with the proposed standards. Currently, the Clean Power Plan is stayed and under review. The Trump Administration has also proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan and is considering a possible replacement rule. In addition, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Therefore, PNMR is dealing with an uncertain regulatory and policy environment. While EPA and other federal agencies may be seeking to reduce climate change regulations,\nA - 16\nsome state agencies, environmental advocacy groups, and other organizations have been focusing considerable attention on GHG from power generation facilities. PNM currently depends on fossil-fueled generation for a significant portion of its electricity. As discussed under Climate Change Issues, this type of generation could be subject to future EPA or state regulations requiring GHG reductions. This includes new, existing, and modified or reconstructed EGUs. The uncertainty regarding climate change regulation presents challenges and represents a possible shift of greater authority to the states to make decisions and issue and enforce regulations. Federal and/or state regulations could result in additional operating restrictions on facilities and increased generation and compliance costs.\nCCBs from the operation of SJGS are currently being used in the reclamation of a surface coal mine. These CCBs consist of fly ash, bottom ash, and gypsum. Any new regulation that would affect the reclamation process, including mine use of CCBs being classified as hazardous waste, could significantly increase the costs of the disposal of CCBs and the costs of mine reclamation. See Note 16.\nA regulatory body may identify a site requiring environmental cleanup and designate PNM or TNMP as a responsible party. There is also uncertainty in quantifying exposure under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if such non-compliance is caused by factors beyond PNM\u2019s or TNMP\u2019s control, may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines.\nBART determinations have been made for both SJGS and Four Corners under the program to address regional haze in the \u201cfour corners\u201d area, which would reduce the levels of NOx emitted at both plants. Significant capital expenditures have been made at SJGS and are continuing at Four Corners for the installation of control technology resulting in operating costs increases. PNMR and its operating subsidiaries may underestimate the costs of environmental compliance, liabilities, and litigation due to the uncertainty inherent in these matters. Although there is uncertainty about the timing and form of the implementation of EPA\u2019s regulations regarding climate change, including the Clean Power Plan, how CCBs used for mine reclamation will be regulated, and regulation of other power plant emissions, including changes to the ambient air quality standards, such regulations could have a material impact on operations. The Company is unable to estimate these costs due to the many uncertainties associated with, among other things, the nature and extent of future regulations and changes in existing regulations, including the changes in regulatory policy under the Trump Administration. Timely regulatory recovery of costs associated with any environmental-related regulations would be needed to maintain a strong financial and operational profile. The above factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to complex government regulation unrelated to the environment, which may have a negative impact on their businesses, financial position and results of operations.\nTo operate their businesses, PNMR, PNM, and TNMP are required to have numerous permits and approvals from a variety of regulatory agencies. Regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over the utilities include the NMPRC, NMED, PUCT, TCEQ, ERCOT, FERC, NRC, EPA, and NERC. Oversight by these agencies covers many aspects of the Company\u2019s utility operations including, but not limited to: location, construction, and operation of facilities; the purchase of power under long-term contracts; conditions of service; the issuance of securities; and rates charged to customers. FERC has issued a number of rules pertaining to preventing undue discrimination in transmission services and electric reliability standards. The significant level of regulation imposes restrictions on the operations of the Company and causes the incurrence of substantial compliance costs. PNMR and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the impact on their business and operating results from future actions of any agency regulating the Company. Changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new ones could result in additional expenses and/or changes in business operations. Failure to comply with any applicable rules, regulations or decisions may lead to customer refunds, fines, penalties, and other payments, which could materially and adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of PNMR and its subsidiaries.\nOperational Factors\nCustomer electricity usage could be reduced by increases in prices charged and other factors. This could result in underutilization of PNM\u2019s generating capacity, as well as underutilization of the capacities of PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s transmission and distribution systems. Should this occur, operating and capital costs might not be fully recovered, and financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nA number of factors influence customers\u2019 electricity usage. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nRates charged by PNM and TNMP\n\u2022\nRates charged by REPs utilizing TNMP\u2019s facilities to deliver power\n\u2022\nEnergy efficiency initiatives\nA - 17\n\u2022\nAvailability and cost of alternative sources of power\n\u2022\nNational, regional, or local economic conditions\nThese factors and others may prompt customers to institute additional energy efficiency measures or take other actions that would result in lower power consumption. If customers bypass or underutilize PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s facilities through self-generation, renewable, or other energy resources, technological change, or other measures, revenues would be negatively impacted.\nPNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s service territories include several military bases and federally funded national laboratories, as well as large industrial customers that have significant direct and indirect impacts on the local economies where they operate. The Company does not directly provide service to any of the military bases or national laboratories, but does provide service to large industrial customers. The Company\u2019s business could be hurt from the impacts on the local economies associated with these customer groups, as well as directly from the large industrial customers, for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nFederally-mandated base closures or significant curtailment of the activities at the bases or national laboratories\n\u2022\nClosure of industrial facilities or significant curtailment of their activities\nAnother factor that could negatively impact the Company is that proposals are periodically advanced in various localities to municipalize, or otherwise take over PNM\u2019s facilities, which PNM believes would require state legislative action to implement, or to establish new municipal utilities in areas currently served by PNM. If any such initiative is successful, the result could be a material reduction in the usage of the facilities, a reduction in rate base, and reduced earnings.\nShould any of the above factors result in facilities being underutilized, the Company\u2019s financial position, operational results, and cash flows could be significantly impacted.\nAdvances in technology could make electric generating facilities less competitive.\nResearch and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption. These technologies include renewable energy, customer-oriented generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. PNM generates power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a cost that is competitive with rates established through the regulatory process. There are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells, which have become increasingly cost competitive. It is possible that advances in technology will continue to reduce the costs of these alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of central station power production. Advances in the capabilities for energy storage could also have impacts on power production by PNM as it would be increasingly simple to reduce peak usage by dispatching battery systems. This could result in demand reduction that could negatively impact revenue and/or result in underutilized assets that had been built to serve peak usage. If these technologies become cost competitive and achieve economies of scale, PNM\u2019s energy sales could be eroded, and the value of its generating facilities could be reduced. Advances in technology could also change the channels through which electric customers purchase or use power, which could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and revenues or increase expenses. These advances can also create more uncertainty in load shapes and forecasts, which could have implications for generation and system planning.\nCosts of decommissioning, remediation, and restoration of nuclear and fossil-fueled power plants, as well as reclamation of related coal mines, could exceed the estimates of PNMR and PNM as well as the amounts PNM recovers from its ratepayers, which could negatively impact results of operations and liquidity.\nPNM has interests in a nuclear power plant, two coal-fired power plants, and several natural gas-fired power plants. PNM is obligated to pay for the costs of decommissioning its share of the power plants. PNM is also obligated to pay for its share of the costs of reclamation of the mines that supply coal to the coal-fired power plants. Likewise, other owners or participants are responsible for their shares of the decommissioning and reclamation obligations and it is important to PNM that those parties fulfill their obligations. Rates charged by PNM to its customers, as approved by the NMPRC, include a provision for recovery of certain costs of decommissioning, remediation, reclamation, and restoration. The NMPRC has established a cap on the amount of costs for the final reclamation of the surface coal mines that may be recovered from customers. PNM records estimated liabilities for its share of the legal obligations for decommissioning and reclamation in accordance with GAAP. These estimates include many assumptions about future events and are inherently imprecise. As discussed in Note 17, PNM\u2019s 2017 IRP indicates that retiring PNM\u2019s share of SJGS in 2022 and exiting PNM\u2019s ownership interest in Four Corners in 2031 would provide long-term cost savings for customers. Should those events occur, the costs of reclamation for the coal mines serving those plants would increase and the increases could be significant. In the event any of these costs exceed current estimates, results of operations could be negatively impacted unless the NMPRC authorizes recovery of the additional costs from ratepayers. In addition, the NMPRC\u2019s order in the NM 2015 Rate Case (Note 17) disallows recovery of future contributions for the decommissioning of certain portions of PVNGS. PNM has appealed the NMPRC decision in the NM 2015 Rate Case, oral argument has been held, and the appeal is\nA - 18\npending before the NM Supreme Court. An adverse outcome of the appeal could negatively impact PNM\u2019s future results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nThe costs of decommissioning any nuclear power plant are substantial. PNM is responsible for all decommissioning obligations related to its entire interest in PVNGS, including portions under lease both during and after termination of the leases. PNM maintains trust funds designed to provide adequate financial resources for decommissioning PVNGS and for reclamation of the coal mines serving SJGS and Four Corners at the end of their expected lives. However, if the PVNGS units are decommissioned before their planned date or the coal mines are shut down sooner than expected, these funds may prove to be insufficient.\nThe financial performance of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP may be adversely affected if power plants and transmission and distribution systems do not operate reliably and efficiently.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends on the successful operation of PNM\u2019s generation assets, as well as the transmission and distribution systems of PNM and TNMP. As indicated above, SJGS Units 2 and 3 were shut down in December 2017. Also, PNM\u2019s 2017 IRP indicates that retiring PNM\u2019s share of SJGS in 2022 and that PNM exiting its ownership interest in Four Corners in 2031 would also provide long-term cost savings for customers. These actions will increase PNM\u2019s dependency on other generation resources, particularly PVNGS, and will reduce PNM\u2019s flexibility in managing those resources. Unscheduled or longer than expected maintenance outages, breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, temporary or permanent shutdowns to achieve environmental compliance, other performance problems with the electric generation assets, severe weather conditions, accidents and other catastrophic events, acts of war or terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, disruptions in the supply, quality, and delivery of fuel and water supplies, and other factors could result in PNM\u2019s load requirements being larger than available system generation capacity. Assured supplies of water are important for PNM\u2019s generating plants. Water in the southwestern United States is limited and there are conflicting claims regarding water rights. In addition, the \u201cfour corners\u201d region where SJGS and Four Corners are located is prone to drought conditions, which could potentially affect the plants\u2019 water supplies. Unplanned outages of generating units and extensions of scheduled outages occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Company\u2019s business. If these were to occur, PNM would be required to purchase electricity in either the wholesale market or spot market at the then-current market price. There can be no assurance that sufficient electricity would be available at reasonable prices, or available at all. The failure of transmission or distribution facilities may also affect PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s ability to deliver power. These potential generation, distribution, and transmission problems, and any service interruptions related to them, could result in lost revenues and additional costs.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to information security breaches and risks of unauthorized access to their information and operational technology systems as well as physical threats to assets.\nThe Company faces the risk of physical and cybersecurity attacks, both threatened and actual, against generation facilities, transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power, information technology systems, and network infrastructure, which could negatively impact the ability of the Company to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate facilities in the most efficient manner or at all.\nThe utility industry in which the Company operates is a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, some of which are deemed to be critical infrastructure under NERC guidelines. Certain of the Company\u2019s systems are interconnected with external networks. In the regular course of business, the utilities handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. PNM and TNMP are subject to the rules of various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. Despite steps the Company may take to detect, mitigate and/or eliminate cybersecurity threats and respond to data security incidents, the techniques used by those who wish to obtain unauthorized access, and possibly disable or sabotage systems and/or abscond with confidential information and data, change frequently and the Company may not be able to protect against such actions.\nIn the event a party desires to disrupt the bulk power or transmission systems in the United States, the Company\u2019s computer and operating systems could be subject to physical or cybersecurity attack. Although the Company has implemented security measures, critical infrastructure, including information and operational technology systems, are vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access, which could occur as a result of malicious compromise, employee error, and/or employee misconduct. A successful physical or cybersecurity attack or other similar failure of the systems could impact the reliability of PNM\u2019s generation and PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s transmission and distribution systems, including the possible unauthorized shutdown of facilities. Such an event could lead to significant disruptions of business operations, including the Company\u2019s ability to generate, transport, and deliver power to serve customers, to bill customers, and to process other financial information. Moreover, a breach of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could also lead to the loss and destruction of confidential and proprietary data, customer and employee data (which may include personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses\nA - 19\nand payment account information), trade secrets, intellectual property and supplier data, and could disrupt business operations which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and financial results, as well as potential increased regulatory oversight, litigation, fines, and other remedial action. The costs incurred to investigate and remediate a physical or cybersecurity attack could be significant. A physical or cybersecurity attack on the Company\u2019s critical infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP.\nThere are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities.\nPNM has a 10.2% undivided interest in PVNGS, including interests in Units 1 and 2 held under leases. PVNGS represents 19.1% of PNM\u2019s total owned and leased generating capacity. PVNGS is subject to environmental, health, and financial risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel and water\n\u2022\nThe ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel\n\u2022\nDecommissioning of the plant (see above)\n\u2022\nSecuring the facilities against possible terrorist attacks\n\u2022\nUnscheduled outages due to equipment failures\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. Events at nuclear facilities of other operators or which impact the industry generally may lead the NRC to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities, including PVNGS. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures and/or increase operating costs.\nIn the event of noncompliance with its requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose a progressively increasing inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit, civil penalties, or both, depending upon the NRC\u2019s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Increased costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny, and/or implementation of plans to achieve compliance with NRC requirements could adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of PNMR and PNM. Although PNM has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at PVNGS, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect PNM\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nPNM has external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some risks. However, it is possible that liabilities associated with nuclear operations could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. See Note 16.\nDemand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity in the open market or building additional generation facilities.\nPNM is obligated to supply power to retail customers and certain wholesale customers. At peak times, power demand could exceed PNM\u2019s available generation capacity, particularly if PNM\u2019s power plants are not performing as anticipated. In addition, SJGS units 2 and 3 were shut down in December 2017 and PNM\u2019s 2017 IRP indicates that it would save customers money for PNM to shut down the remaining two units of SJGS in 2022 and to exit ownership in Four Corners in 2031. SJGS and Four Corners comprise a significant portion of PNM\u2019s base load generation capacity and their retirement would increase reliance on other existing or new generating resources. Market forces, competitive forces, or adverse regulatory actions may require PNM to purchase capacity on the open market or build additional generation capabilities. Regulators or market conditions may not permit PNM to pass all of these purchases or construction costs on to customers. If that occurs, PNM may not be able to fully recover these costs or there may be a lag between when costs are incurred and when regulators permit recovery in customers\u2019 rates. These situations could have negative impacts on results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral Economic and Weather Factors\nGeneral economic conditions of the nation and/or specific areas can affect the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers. Economic recession or downturn may result in decreased consumption by customers and increased bad debt expense, and could also negatively impact suppliers, all of which could negatively impact the Company.\nEconomic activity in the service territories of PNMR subsidiaries is a key factor in their performance. Decreased economic activity can lead to declines in energy consumption, which could adversely affect future revenues, earnings, and growth. Higher unemployment rates, both in the Company\u2019s service territories and nationwide, could result in commercial customers ceasing operations and lower levels of income for residential customers. These customers might then be unable to pay their bills on time,\nA - 20\nwhich could increase bad debt expense and negatively impact results of operations and cash flows. Economic conditions also impact the supply and/or cost of commodities and materials needed to construct or acquire utility assets or make necessary repairs.\nUncertainties regarding the impacts and implementation of recent United States tax reform legislation may negatively impact PNMR\u2019s, PNM\u2019s, and TNMP\u2019s businesses, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, comprehensive changes in United States federal income taxes were enacted through legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). Among other things, the Tax Act reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, eliminates federal bonus depreciation for utilities effective September 28, 2017, and, effective January 1, 2018, limits interest deductibility for non-utility businesses and limits the deductibility of certain officer compensation. In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides guidance to address the application of GAAP to reflect the Tax Act in circumstances where all information and analysis of the Tax Act is not yet available or complete. This bulletin provides for up to a one-year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act.\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Company adjusted its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 resulting in increases in regulatory liabilities related to adjustments of net deferred tax liabilities associated with regulated activities, which will be returned to PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s ratepayers over time, and increases in income tax expense related to adjustments of net deferred tax assets related to items excluded from regulated activities. The Company believes it has made reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act as of December 31, 2017 and reflected the impacts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company currently believes that the impacts of the Tax Act will not significantly impact the future earnings of regulated activities due to the ratemaking process. However, cash flows will be reduced in the near term due to less cash being received from customer billings as the benefits of the reduced corporate income tax are passed on to ratepayers, but without a corresponding reduction in income taxes paid due to the Company having a net operating loss carryforward for income taxes purposes. In addition, the income tax benefit of net losses for the unregulated activities of PNMR, primarily interest expense on holding company debt, will be negatively impacted by the reduced rate. Furthermore, there is uncertainty regarding the interpretation of the provision of the Tax Act that limits the deductibility of interest for non-utility businesses under the interest expense allocation methodology that is generally used by the utility industry.\nIt is possible that changes to U.S. Treasury regulations, IRS interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act, actions by the NMPRC, PUCT, and FERC, or the Company\u2019s further analysis of historical records could cause the estimates of the impacts recorded as of December 31, 2017 to change or cause the Company\u2019s current assessment of future impacts to change. Any such change could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe operating results of PNMR and its operating subsidiaries fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis, as well as being affected by weather conditions, including regional drought.\nElectric generation, transmission, and distribution are generally seasonal businesses that vary with the demand for power. With power consumption typically peaking during the hot summer months, revenues traditionally peak during that period. As a result, quarterly operating results of PNMR and its operating subsidiaries vary throughout the year. In addition, PNMR and its operating subsidiaries have historically had lower revenues resulting in lower earnings when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net earnings, and cash flows of the Company.\nDrought conditions in New Mexico, especially in the \u201cfour corners\u201d region, where SJGS and Four Corners are located, may affect the water supply for PNM\u2019s generating plants. If inadequate precipitation occurs in the watershed that supplies that region, PNM may have to decrease generation at these plants. This would require PNM to purchase power to serve customers and/or reduce the ability to sell excess power on the wholesale market and reduce revenues. Drought conditions or actions taken by the court system, regulators, or legislators could limit PNM\u2019s supply of water, which would adversely impact PNM\u2019s business. Although SJGS and Four Corners participate in voluntary shortage sharing agreements with tribes and other water users in the \u201cfour corners\u201d region, PNM cannot be certain these contracts will be enforceable in the event of a major drought or that it will be able to renew these contracts in the future.\nTNMP\u2019s service areas are exposed to extreme weather, including high winds, drought, flooding, ice storms, and periodic hurricanes. Extreme weather conditions, particularly high winds and severe thunderstorms, also occur periodically in PNM\u2019s service areas. These severe weather events can physically damage facilities owned by TNMP and PNM. Any such occurrence both disrupts the ability to deliver energy and increases costs. Extreme weather can also reduce customers\u2019 usage and demand for energy. These factors could negatively impact results of operations and cash flows.\nA - 21\nFinancial Factors\nPNMR may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or distributions to PNMR.\nPNMR is a holding company and has no operations of its own. PNMR\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock primarily depends on the net income and cash flows of PNM and TNMP and their capacity to pay upstream dividends or distributions. Prior to providing funds to PNMR, PNM and TNMP have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of PNM, preferred stock dividends.\nThe NMPRC has placed certain restrictions on the ability of PNM to pay dividends to PNMR, including that PNM cannot pay dividends that cause its debt rating to fall below investment grade. The NMPRC has also restricted PNM from paying dividends in any year, as determined on a rolling four-quarter basis, in excess of net earnings without prior NMPRC approval. PNM is permitted to pay dividends to PNMR from prior equity contributions made by PNMR. Additionally, the Company\u2019s financing agreements generally include a covenant to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio that does not exceed 65%, PNM has various financial covenants that limit the transfer of assets, through dividends or other means and the Federal Power Act imposes certain restrictions on dividends paid by public utilities, including that dividends cannot be paid from paid-in capital.\nFurther, the ability of PNMR to declare dividends depends upon:\n\u2022\nThe extent to which cash flows will support dividends\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s financial circumstances and performance\n\u2022\nDecisions of the NMPRC and PUCT in various regulatory cases currently pending or that may be docketed in the future, including the outcome of appeals of those decisions\n\u2022\nConditions imposed by the NMPRC, PUCT, or Federal Power Act\n\u2022\nThe effect of federal regulatory decisions and legislative acts\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions in the United States and in the Company\u2019s service areas\n\u2022\nFuture growth plans and the related capital requirements\n\u2022\nOther business considerations\nDisruption in the credit and capital markets may impact the Company\u2019s strategy and ability to raise capital.\nAs discussed in MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources, PNMR and its subsidiaries rely on access to both short-term and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations. In general, the Company relies on its short-term credit facilities as the initial source to finance construction expenditures. This results in increased borrowings under the facilities over time. The Company is currently projecting total construction expenditures for the years 2018-2022 to be $2,712.1 million. If PNMR or its operating subsidiaries are not able to access capital at competitive rates, or at all, PNMR\u2019s ability to finance capital requirements and implement its strategy will be limited. Disruptions in the credit markets, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s access to capital, could be caused by:\n\u2022\nAn economic recession\n\u2022\nDeclines in the health of the banking sector generally, or the failure of specific banks who are parties to the Company\u2019s credit facilities\n\u2022\nDeterioration in the overall health of the utility industry\n\u2022\nThe bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company\n\u2022\nWar, terrorist attacks, or cybersecurity attacks, or threatened attacks\nIf the Company\u2019s cash flow and credit and capital resources are insufficient to fund capital expenditure plans, the Company may be forced to delay important capital investments, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital, or restructure debt. In addition, insufficient cash flows and capital resources may result in reductions of credit ratings. This could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would result in an increase in the interest rates applicable under the Company\u2019s credit facilities. The Company\u2019s cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient to pay interest and principal on debt in the future. If that should occur, the Company\u2019s capital raising or debt restructuring measures may be unsuccessful or inadequate to meet scheduled debt service obligations. This could cause the Company to default on its obligations and further impair liquidity.\nReduction in credit ratings or changing rating agency requirements could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth, strategy, business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nA - 22\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP cannot be sure that any of their current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be put under review for a downgrade, lowered, or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. On January 16, 2018, S&P changed the outlook for PNMR, PNM and TNMP from stable to negative while affirming the investment grade ratings of each entity. Downgrades or changing requirements could result in increased borrowing costs due to higher interest rates on current borrowings or future financings, a smaller potential pool of investors, and decreased funding sources. Such conditions also could require the provision of additional support in the form of letters of credit and cash or other collateral to various counterparties.\nDeclines in values of marketable securities held in trust funds for pension and other postretirement benefits and in the NDT and mine reclamation trusts could result in sustained increases in costs and funding requirements for those obligations, which may affect operational results.\nThrough 2017, the Company targeted 21% of its pension trust funds and 70% of its trust funds for other postretirement benefits to be invested in marketable equity securities. Historically, over one-half of funds held in the NDT and mine reclamation trusts have been invested in marketable equity securities. Due to the current funded status of the NDT and recent overall market performance, PNM began re-balancing the NDT investment portfolio with a target of 85% fixed income (debt) securities. The re-balancing was completed in January 2018 and increases the exposure of the NDT investment portfolio to interest rate risk. The Company is also contemplating decreasing its allocation target beginning in 2018 for liability matching fixed-income securities in the pension trusts from 65% to 50%. Declines in market values could result in increased funding of the trusts, the recognition of losses as impairments for the NDT and mine reclamation trusts, and additional expense for the benefit plans. In addition, a change in GAAP requires that all changes in the fair value of equity securities recorded on the Company\u2019s balance sheet be reflected in earnings beginning in 2018, which could result in increased volatility in earnings.\nImpairments of goodwill and long-lived assets of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe Company annually evaluates recorded goodwill for impairment. See Note 18 and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of MD&A. Long-lived assets are also assessed whenever indicators of impairment exist. Factors that affect the long-term value of these assets, including treatment by regulators in ratemaking proceedings, as well as other economic and market conditions, could result in impairments. Significant impairments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nPNM\u2019s PVNGS leases describe certain events, including \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d and \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d, the occurrence of which could require PNM to take ownership of the underlying assets and pay the lessors for the assets.\nThe \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d generally relate to casualties, accidents, and other events at PVNGS, including the occurrence of specified nuclear events, which would severely adversely affect the ability of the operating agent, APS, to operate, and the ability of PNM to earn a return on its interests in PVNGS. The \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d consist primarily of legal and regulatory changes (such as issuance by the NRC of specified violation orders, changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal, or changes in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations). PNM believes that the probability of such \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d or \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d occurring is remote for the following reasons: (1) to a large extent, prevention of \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d and some \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d is within the control of the PVNGS participants through the general PVNGS operational and safety oversight process; and (2) other \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d would involve a significant change in current law and policy. PNM is unaware of any proposals pending or being considered for introduction in Congress, or in any state legislative or regulatory body that, if adopted, would cause any of those events. See Note 7.\nGovernance Factors\nProvisions of PNMR\u2019s organizational documents, as well as several other statutory and regulatory factors, will limit another party\u2019s ability to acquire PNMR and could deprive PNMR\u2019s shareholders of the opportunity to receive a takeover premium for shares of PNMR\u2019s common stock.\nPNMR\u2019s restated articles of incorporation and by-laws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of discouraging persons from acquiring large blocks of PNMR\u2019s common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control of PNMR. The material provisions that may have such an effect include:\n\u2022\nAuthorization for the Board to issue PNMR\u2019s preferred stock in series and to fix rights and preferences of the series (including, among other things, voting rights and preferences with respect to dividends and other matters)\n\u2022\nAdvance notice procedures with respect to any proposal other than those adopted or recommended by the Board\nA - 23\n\u2022\nProvisions specifying that only a majority of the Board, the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, or holders of at least one-tenth of all of PNMR\u2019s shares entitled to vote may call a special meeting of stockholders\nUnder the New Mexico Public Utility Act, NMPRC approval is required for certain transactions that may result in PNMR\u2019s change in control or exercise of control, including ownership of 10% or more of PNMR\u2019s voting stock. PUCT approval is required for changes to the ownership of TNMP or its parent and certain other transactions relating to TNMP. Certain acquisitions of PNMR\u2019s outstanding voting securities also require FERC approval.", "PERMNO": 55511, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "PNM"}
