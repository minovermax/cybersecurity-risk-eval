{"cik": "1121484", "company": "OIL STATES INTERNATIONAL, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nDeclines in crude oil prices to record low levels as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and a significantly oversupplied crude oil market have negatively impacted, and are expected to continue to negatively impact, demand for our products and services resulting in a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nPublic health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact our operations, the operations of our customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for our services. Fear of such events has also altered the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and production activities and adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that has affected demand for our services. A significant majority of states as well as local jurisdictions have imposed, and others in the future may impose, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders or restrictions, and the perception that such orders or restrictions could occur, have resulted in business closures, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, work-from-home policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of events, among other effects. In an effort to minimize the spread of illness, we and our customers have implemented various worksite restrictions as well as quarantining in order to minimize the chances of a potential COVID-19 outbreak, which could result in decreased operational effectiveness and disruptions in our equipment delivery and supply chain for our customers. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2020, our manufacturing and services facilities are open, but our operations still face certain interruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even once the worst impacts have subsided, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact our business through, for example, reductions in the demand for gasoline by consumers who may be more inclined to work from home than commute to work. We are continuing to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business, including as a result of changes in consumer behavior, which has resulted in a decrease in the demand for crude oil and natural gas and, consequently, our products and services.\nContemporaneously with the widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, the increase in crude oil supply resulting from production escalations from OPEC, combined with a decrease in crude oil demand stemming from the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 resulted in a sharp decline in crude oil prices. In response, a number of our exploration and production company customers announced significant reductions in capital spending for drilling, completion, production and other projects on which our products and services would be used. These reductions in spending and activity levels have negatively impacted, and we expect they will continue to negatively impact, demand for our products and services, the prices we can charge for those products and services and, as a result, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Although OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies ultimately agreed to reduce production and many operators have shut-in production in the United States, supply continues to exceed demand and crude oil prices remain volatile and at lower levels. Further actions among OPEC members and other producing nations as to production levels and prices could result in further declines in crude oil prices, which would prove detrimental, particularly given the weak demand environment for crude oil and associated products caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 and lower crude oil prices impacts our results, financial position and liquidity will depend on future developments, such as the availability of effective treatments and vaccines, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nDemand for the majority of our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. Lower oil and natural gas prices have significantly reduced the demand for our products and services and the prices we are able to charge. This has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends substantially on the level of capital expenditures invested in the oil and natural gas industry. The decline in crude oil prices, coupled with higher crude oil inventory levels in 2020, caused rapid reductions in most of our customers' drilling, completion and production activities which resulted in an oversupply of many of our services and products and substantially reduced the prices we could charge our customers for these services and products. A continuation or worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and it is difficult to predict how long the current commodity price environment will continue.\nPrices could remain highly volatile and have adverse effects on our business and operations due to numerous factors, including:\n\u2022public health crises, such as the COVID-19 outbreak at the beginning of 2020, which has negatively impacted the global economy, and correspondingly, the price of crude oil;\n\u2022worldwide demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the level of drilling and completion activity;\n\u2022the level of oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022the levels of oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022depletion rates;\n\u2022the expected cost of finding, developing and producing new reserves;\n\u2022delays in major offshore and onshore oil and natural gas field permitting or development timetables;\n\u2022the availability of attractive offshore and onshore oil and natural gas field prospects that may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists that may restrict development;\n\u2022the availability of transportation infrastructure for oil and natural gas, refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u2022global weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022worldwide economic activity including growth in developing countries;\n\u2022national government political requirements, including the ability and willingness of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining or transportation assets;\n\u2022shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to limit or cease certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development, production and transportation of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations;\n\u2022rapid technological change and the timing and extent of development of energy sources, including liquefied natural gas as well as solar, wind and other renewable energy sources;\n\u2022environmental and other governmental laws and regulations; and\n\u2022domestic and foreign tax policies, including those regarding tariffs and duties.\nIn response to lower oil prices, many of our customers have reduced or delayed their capital spending, which reduced the demand for our products and services and exerted downward pressure on the prices paid for our products and services. We expect that we will continue to encounter weakness in the demand for, and prices of, our products and services until commodity prices stabilize at higher levels and our customers' capital spending increases. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and production activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our equipment utilization, revenues, cash flows and profitability; our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nWe might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and certain of them have relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product, equipment and service quality, availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, safety performance and price. In some of our product and service offerings, we compete with the oil and natural gas industry's largest oilfield service providers. These large national and multi-national companies have greater financial, technical and other resources, and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with many smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services, and changes in customer requirements. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present products and services, or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConsolidation of our customers and competitors may impact our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periods of consolidation which has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Industry consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers or competitors or consolidated entities using size and purchasing power to seek pricing or other concessions, which may lead to decreased demand for our products and services. In addition, recent, ongoing and future mergers, combinations and consolidations in our industry could result in existing competitors increasing their market share. As a result, industry consolidation may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIf we do not develop new competitive technologies and products, our business and revenues may be adversely affected.\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater depths, higher pressure levels and harsher conditions. If we are unable to design, develop and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. Many of our competitors are large multinational companies that may have significantly greater financial resources than we have, and they may be able to devote greater resources to research and development of new systems, services and technologies than we are able to do. In addition, competitors or customers may develop new technologies, which address similar or improved solutions to our existing technology. In 2019, for example, our Downhole Technologies segment sales of perforating products declined due, in part, to the introduction of integrated gun systems by its competitors. Additionally, the development and commercialization of new products and services requires substantial capital expenditures and we may not have access to needed capital at attractive rates or at all due to our financial condition, disruptions of the bank or capital markets, or other reasons beyond our control to continue these activities. Should our technologies become the less attractive solution, our operations and profitability would be negatively impacted.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe may experience various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, or third-party facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we devote significant resources to protect the information systems and data we rely on in our business, cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, use of phishing/ransomware attacks and fraudulent domain names/websites, among others, which increased in 2020 following the outbreak of COVID-19. While we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these security threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats and other disruptions, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information (including our intellectual property and customer data), critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities, essential to our operations, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur inability to control the inherent risks of identifying and integrating businesses that we have or may acquire, including any related increases in debt or issuances of equity securities, could adversely affect our operations.\nWe continually review complementary acquisition opportunities and we may seek to consummate acquisitions of such businesses in the future. However, we may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future or at all. In addition, we may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions, which could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition and could result in significant dilution to stockholders.\nWe expect to gain certain business, financial, and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake, including synergies and operating efficiencies. However, these transactions involve risks including:\n\u2022retaining key employees and customers of acquired businesses;\n\u2022retaining supply and distribution relationships key to the supply chain;\n\u2022increased administrative burden, including additional costs associated with regulatory compliance;\n\u2022diversion of management time and attention;\n\u2022developing our sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022managing our growth effectively;\n\u2022integrating operations, workforce, product lines and technology;\n\u2022managing tax and foreign exchange exposure;\n\u2022operating a new line of business;\n\u2022inability to pursue and protect patents covering acquired technology;\n\u2022addition of acquisition-related debt and increased expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u2022substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses, write-off of in-process research and development, impairments of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022becoming subject to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to the acquired business; and\n\u2022achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition, including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies or synergies.\nIf we fail to manage any of these risks successfully, our business could be harmed. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition, and our stockholders may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial, and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nFor example, see Note 7, \"Long-term Debt,\" and Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain unanticipated issues and claims that have arisen following the GEODynamics Acquisition.\nWe might be unable to employ and retain a sufficient number of key personnel.\nWe believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain key personnel with both technical and business expertise. As observed in the U.S. shale play regions such as the Permian Basin in recent years, during periods of increased activity, the demand for such personnel is high, and the supply is limited. When these events occur, our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired. Conversely, during periods of reduced activity, we are forced to reduce headcount, freeze or reduce wages, and implement other cost-saving measures which could lead skilled personnel to migrate to other industries.\nWe depend on several significant customers in each of our business segments, and the loss of one or more such customers or the inability of one or more such customers to meet their obligations to us, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2020 or 2019, Halliburton Company individually accounted for 10% of our total consolidated revenues in 2018.\nThe loss of a significant portion of customers in any of our business segments, or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers, could result in a loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the concentration of customers in one industry impacts our overall exposure to credit risk, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, we do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables.\nAs a result of our industry concentration, risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt, or the issuance of equity. In 2020, many of our customers experienced substantial reductions in their cash flows from operations, and some are experiencing liquidity shortages, lack of access to capital and credit markets, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and other adverse impacts to their financial condition. These conditions caused a number of our customers to claim bankruptcy protection in 2020 which could continue. The inability, or failure of, our significant customers to meet their obligations to us, or their insolvency or liquidation, may adversely affect our financial results.\nWeather conditions in our regions of operations may limit our ability to operate our business and could adversely affect our operating results, which are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility.\nOur operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in the Rocky Mountain and Northeast regions of the United States, where severe winter weather conditions can restrict access to work areas. In addition, summer and fall completion and drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms\nprevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. As a result of these seasonal differences, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters.\nMany forecasters also expect that potential climate changes may have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events and could have an adverse effect on our or our customers' operations. Any unusual or prolonged severe weather or increased frequency thereof, such as freezing rain, earthquakes, hurricanes, droughts, or floods in our or our oil and gas exploration and production customers' areas of operations or markets, whether due to climate change or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated or insured against.\nFinancial Risks\nWe may be unable to access the capital and credit markets or borrow on affordable terms to obtain additional capital that we may require.\nWe rely on our liquidity to pay our operating and capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on debt, taxes and other similar costs. Historically, we have sought to finance the operation of our business primarily with cash on-hand and cash provided by operating activities, but we have also relied on capital from the bank and capital markets. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to and volatility in the global financial markets. For companies like ours in the energy industry, this market disruption has significantly impacted the value of our common stock; has and may continue to reduce our ability to access capital in the bank and capital markets; and has and may continue to result in capital being available on less favorable terms, all of which could negatively affect our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations. In addition, a recession or long-term market correction could further materially impact the value of our common stock, our access to capital or our liquidity or ability to generate cash from operations in the near and long-term. If we are unable to access the bank and capital markets on favorable terms, or if we are not successful in raising capital at an attractive cost within the time period required or at all, we may not be able to grow or maintain our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBacklog in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and, therefore, has limitations as an indicator of our future revenues and earnings.\nThe revenues projected in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not result in profits. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers' projects, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized. Material delays, cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSome of the contracts in our backlog are cancellable by the customer, subject to the payment of termination fees and/or the reimbursement of our costs incurred. We typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog once a project is canceled. While backlog cancellations have not been significant in the past, we incurred cancellations totaling $2.2 million, $5.0 million and $6.5 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If commodity prices do not further improve, or decline, we may incur additional cancellations or experience further declines in our backlog.\nWe may assume contractual risks in developing, manufacturing and delivering products in our Offshore/Manufactured Products business segment.\nMany of our products from our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment are ordered by customers under frame agreements or project-specific contracts. In many cases these contracts stipulate a fixed price for the delivery of our products and impose liquidated damages or late delivery fees if we do not meet specific customer deadlines. Our actual costs, and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts, may vary from the expected contract economics for various reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u2022errors or omissions in estimates or bidding;\n\u2022changes in availability and cost of materials and labor;\n\u2022failures of our suppliers to deliver raw materials and other goods that comply with our specifications;\n\u2022variations in productivity from our original estimates;\n\u2022changes in tariffs or tax regimes; and\n\u2022material changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThese variations and the risks inherent in our projects may result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nIn addition, there are other risks and liabilities associated with these contracts, such as consequential damages payable (generally as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct), unforeseen technical or logistical challenges in fulfilling the contracts, or warranty claims, any of which could result in our not being fully or properly compensated for the cost to develop, design, and manufacture the final product and resulting in a significant impact on our reported operating results as we progress towards completion of major jobs.\nExchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our U.S. reported results of operations and financial position.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into purchase and sales commitments that are denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currency used by our operating subsidiaries. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can create volatility in our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate that risk entirely. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate net revenues or earnings in countries whose currency is not the U.S. dollar, the translation of such amounts into U.S. dollars can result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our net revenues and earnings depending upon exchange rate movements. As a result, a material decrease in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may have a negative impact on our reported results of operations and cash flows. Any currency controls implemented by local monetary authorities in countries where we currently operate could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGiven the cyclical nature of our business, a severe prolonged downturn could negatively affect the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, goodwill and other intangible assets represented 7% and 18%, respectively, of our total assets. We record goodwill when the consideration we pay in acquiring a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of that business. We are required to at least annually review the goodwill and other intangible assets of our applicable reporting units (Completion Services, Downhole Technologies and Offshore/Manufactured Products) for impairment in value and to recognize a non-cash charge against earnings causing a corresponding decrease in stockholders' equity if circumstances, some of which are beyond our control, indicate that the carrying amounts will not be recoverable.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we recognized goodwill impairment charges totaling $406.1 million in our Completion Services, Downhole Technologies and Offshore/Manufactured Products reporting units due to, among other factors, the significant decline in our stock price and that of our peers and reduced growth rate expectations given weak energy market conditions resulting from the demand destruction caused by the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the estimated returns required by market participants increased materially in our March 31, 2020 assessment from our assessment as of December 1, 2019, resulting in higher discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analysis.\nWhile no additional provisions for impairment were identified during our December 1, 2020 assessment, it is possible that we could recognize goodwill or other intangible assets impairment losses in the future if, among other factors:\n\u2022global economic and industry conditions deteriorate;\n\u2022the outlook for future profits and cash flow for any of our reporting units deteriorate further as the result of many possible factors, including, but not limited to, increased or unanticipated competition, lack of technological development, further reductions in customer capital spending plans, loss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory judgment(s), future operating losses at a reporting unit, downward forecast revisions, or restructuring plans;\n\u2022laws, executive actions or regulatory initiatives are imposed, which significantly restrict, delay or otherwise reduce the drilling, completion and production of oil and natural gas wells;\n\u2022domestic and/or foreign income tax rates increase, or regulations change;\n\u2022costs of equity or debt capital increase;\n\u2022valuations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate; or\n\u2022our stock price experiences a sustained decline.\nLegal or Regulatory Risks\nWe do business in international jurisdictions which exposes us to unique risks.\nA portion of our revenue and net assets are attributable to operations in countries outside the United States. Risks associated with our international operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022expropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u2022foreign capital controls or similar monetary or exchange limitations;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022foreign taxation;\n\u2022tariffs and duties on imported and exported goods;\n\u2022the inability to repatriate earnings or capital in a tax efficient manner;\n\u2022changing political conditions;\n\u2022economic or trade sanctions;\n\u2022changing foreign and domestic monetary and trade policies;\n\u2022regulatory restrictions or controls more stringently applied or enforced;\n\u2022changes in trade activity;\n\u2022military or social situations, such as a widespread outbreak of an illness such as COVID-19 or other public health issues, in foreign areas where we do business, and the possibilities of war, other armed conflict or terrorist attacks; and\n\u2022regional economic downturns.\nAdditionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors, or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete in such jurisdictions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices and impact our business. Any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also face fines, sanctions, and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in, or curtailment of, business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of assets. Additionally, we may have competitors who are not subject to the same ethics-related laws and regulations which provides them with a competitive advantage over us by securing business awards, licenses, or other preferential treatment, in those jurisdictions using methods that certain ethics-related laws and regulations prohibit us from using.\nThe regulatory regimes in some foreign countries may be substantially different than those in the United States, and may be unfamiliar to U.S. investors. Violations of foreign laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nThe ultimate impact of recent changes to tariffs and duties imposed by the United States and other countries is uncertain. We use a variety of domestically produced and imported raw materials and component products, including steel, in the manufacture of our products. In 2018, the United States imposed tariffs on a variety of imported products, including steel and aluminum. In response to the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, the European Union and several other countries, including Canada and China, have threatened and/or imposed retaliatory tariffs. The effect of these tariffs and the application and interpretation of existing trade agreements and customs, anti-dumping and countervailing duty regulations continues to evolve,\nand we continue to monitor these matters. If we encounter difficulty in procuring these raw materials and component products, or if the prices we have to pay for these products increase further as a result of customs, anti-dumping and countervailing duty regulations or otherwise, and we are unable to pass corresponding cost increases on to our customers, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, uncertainty with respect to potential costs in the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells could cause our customers to delay or cancel planned projects which, if this occurred, would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 14, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nThe results of the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union including subsequent exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic uncertainties may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nWe are a multinational company and are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in other countries, including the United Kingdom (the \"U.K.\"). In June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum (\"Brexit\"). On January 31, 2020, the U.K. Parliament ratified a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. government and the European Union (the \"EU\"), which contemplated a transition period to end on December 31, 2020, to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed upon. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement (the \"Trade and Cooperation Agreement\"), which covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the U.K. and the EU as it relates to trade, transport, visas, judicial, law enforcement and security matters, and continued participation in community programs and mechanisms for dispute resolution. Notably, under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, U.K. service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the entire EU single market, U.K. goods no longer benefit from the free movement of goods and there is no longer the free movement of people between the U.K. and the EU. The terms of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the jurisdictions in which we operate and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees.\nBrexit and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement can subject us to increased risks, including but not limited to, changes in regulatory oversight, disruptions to supply, increases in prices, fees, taxes or tariffs on goods that are sold between the EU and the U.K., inspections or barriers on goods sold between the U.K. and the EU, extra charges, and/or difficulty staffing. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently in the process of evaluating our own risks and uncertainty related to what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications this new Brexit trade deal could have on our U.K. business operations. This uncertainty also includes the impact on our customers' business operations and capital planning as well as the overall impact on the staffing industry. While we have not experienced any direct material financial impact since Brexit in 2016, we cannot predict its future implications which could result in a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nExplosive incidents arising out of dangerous materials used in our business could disrupt operations and result in bodily injuries and property damages, which occurrences could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur Downhole Technologies segment operations include the licensing, storage and handling of explosive materials that are subject to regulation by the ATF and analogous state agencies. Despite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our performance of employee training programs, the storage and handling of explosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers' operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such incidents could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our ATF or analogous state license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities and our insurance may not cover certain liabilities, including litigation risks.\nThe products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex, and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers' costs. In addition, many of these products are used in inherently hazardous applications where an accident or product failure can cause personal injury or loss of life, damages to property, equipment, or the environment, regulatory investigations and penalties, and the suspension or cancellation of the end-user's operations. If our products or services fail to meet specifications, or are involved in accidents or failures, we could\nface warranty, contract, or other litigation claims for which we may be held responsible and our reputation for providing quality products may suffer. In the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims, lawsuits, and administrative proceedings, seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees, and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold, and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses.\nWe maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under our insurance policies. It is possible, however, that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position. We also face the following other risks related to our insurance coverage:\n\u2022we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance, such as damages from environmental contamination, terrorist attacks or acts of war;\n\u2022the counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks; and\n\u2022we may incur losses from interruption of our business or cybersecurity attacks that exceed our insurance coverage.\nWe might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our businesses, including our patents relating to our FlexJoint\u00ae, Merlin\u2122 and SmartStart Plus\u00ae technologies, and intervention and downhole extended-reach tools (including our HydroPull\u00ae tool) utilized in the completion or workover of oil and natural gas wells. The market success of our technologies will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce our proprietary rights in these technologies, to preserve rights in our trade secret and non-public information. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, we may be required to expend significant amounts of money pursuing and defending our intellectual property rights, and these proceedings may not ultimately be successful. For example, during 2018 we incurred expenses in excess of $8 million in connection with patent defense. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If any of our patents or other intellectual property rights are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, or if a court or other tribunal limits the scope of claims in a patent or fails to recognize our trade secret rights, our competitive advantages could be significantly reduced in the relevant technology, allowing competition for our customer base to increase, adversely affecting our competitive position.\nIn addition, the tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe, or be alleged to infringe, upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, and may distract us from running our core business. Royalty payments under a license from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license was not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLaws, regulations and other executive actions or regulatory initiatives regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business and result in additional operating restrictions, delays or cancellations in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, or possible bans on the performance of hydraulic fracturing that may reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing, a material portion of our Completion Services, Downhole Technologies and Offshore/Manufactured Products operations support many of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers in such activities. There exists federal regulatory initiatives and various state laws and regulations that have increased, and have the potential to further increase, the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, there also exists, under the Biden Administration, the potential for new or amended laws, regulations, executive actions and other regulatory initiatives that could impose more stringent restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including potential restrictions on hydraulic fracturing by banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands. The Biden Administration issued an order temporarily suspending the issuance of new leases and authorizations on federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days beginning January 20, 2021, and subsequently issued a second order in January 2021 suspending the issuance of new leases on federal lands and waters pending completion of a study of current oil and gas practices. Although theses suspensions do not limit existing operations under valid leases and are not applicable to tribal lands that the federal government holds in trust,\nfurther constraints may be adopted by the Biden Administration in the future. See \"Part I, Item 1. Business - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\" for more discussion on these hydraulic fracturing matters. The occurrence of any one or more of these developments with respect to hydraulic fracturing in areas where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate could result in potentially significant added costs to comply with requirements relating to permitting, construction, financial assurance, monitoring, recordkeeping, and/or plugging and abandonment. In addition, they could experience restrictions, delays or cancellations in the pursuit of production or development activities. Any of the foregoing could reduce demand for the products and services of one or more of our business segments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn countries outside of the United States, including provincial, regional, tribal or local jurisdictions therein where we conduct operations, there may exist similar governmental restrictions or controls on our customers' hydraulic fracturing activities, which, if such restrictions or controls exist or are adopted in the future, our customers may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or pursuit of their operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays in the drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur oil and natural gas producing customers dispose of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. In recent years, wells in the United States used for the disposal by injection of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids below ground into non-producing formations have been associated with an increased number of seismic events. In response, regulators in states in which our customers operate have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. See \"Part I, Item 1. Business-Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\" for more discussion on these seismicity matters. The introduction of new environmental laws and regulations related to the disposal of wastes associated with the exploration or production of hydrocarbons could limit or prohibit the ability of our customers to utilize underground injection wells. As a result, our customers may have to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations and, in some instances those customers, or third party disposal well operators that are used by those customers to dispose of the customers' wastewater, may be obligated to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers' business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nImposition of laws, executive actions or regulatory initiatives to restrict, delay or cancel leasing, permitting or drilling activities in deepwaters of the United States or foreign countries may reduce demand for our services and products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment provides products and services for oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operating offshore in the deepwaters of the United States and in other countries. In the United States, the Biden Administration has issued orders suspending the issuance of new oil and gas leases and authorizations on federal lands and waters, including the OCS. Separately, President Biden has issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry and an increased emphasis on climate-related risks across government agencies and economic sectors. President Biden may pursue additional executive orders, new legislation and regulatory initiatives to further implement his regulatory agenda. Additionally, regulatory agencies under the Biden Administration may issue new or amended rulemakings regarding deepwater leasing, permitting or drilling that could result in more stringent or costly restrictions, delays or cancellations in offshore oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, such as the Biden Administration's suspension of the issuance of authorizations for oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters, although the suspension does not limit existing operations under valid leases. See \"Part I, Item 1. Business - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\" for more discussion on these deepwater regulatory matters.\nAny new legislation, executive actions or regulatory initiatives, whether in the United States under the Biden Administration or in other countries, that impose increased costs, more stringent operational standards or result in significant delays, cancellations or disruptions in our customers' operations, increase the risk of losing leasing or permitting opportunities, expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, increased supplemental bonding costs, or cause our customers to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of their facilities, any or all of which could reduce demand for our products and services. Also, if material spill events were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event were to occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas\nexploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws, regulations, executive actions or regulatory initiatives on our customers' drilling operations or the opportunity to pursue such operations, or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover the risks associated with such operations. The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations and those of our customers in the United States and in foreign countries are subject to stringent federal, state and local legal requirements governing environmental protection. These requirements may take the form of laws, regulations, executive actions and various other legal initiatives. See \"Part I, Item 1. Business - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\" for more discussion on these matters.\nCompliance with these regulations and other regulatory initiatives, or any other new environmental laws and regulations could, among other things, require us or our customers to install new or modified emission controls on equipment or processes, incur longer permitting timelines, and incur increased capital or operating expenditures, which costs may be significant. Additionally, one or more of these developments that impact our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers could reduce demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nOur business activities present risks of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Additionally, private parties, including the owners or operators of properties upon which we perform services and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by prior owners or operators of properties or other third parties. Remedial costs and other damages, including natural resources damages arising as a result of environmental laws and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nWe could incur significant costs in complying with stringent occupational health and safety requirements.\nWe are subject to stringent federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the Well Site Services, Downhole Technologies, and Offshore Manufactured Products business segments. In addition, OSHA's hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures to comply with occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Historically these costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results.\nOur and our customers' operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the products and services we provide.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, financial and litigation risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. For example, President Biden has signed a series of executive orders that, among other things, recommitted\nthe United States to the Paris Agreement, called for increased emphasis on climate change across government agencies and economic sectors, suspended the issuance of new leases and authorizations for oil and gas development on federal leans and waters, and called for the issuance of new or more stringent emissions standards for new, modified and existing oil and gas facilities. See \"Part I, Item 1. Business - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\" for more discussion on the threat of regulation of GHG emissions.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state executive actions, legislation, regulations or regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming fossil fuels. Such legislation or regulations could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products. Additionally, political, financial and litigation risks may result in our oil and natural gas customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our services and products. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons, and therefore for our products and services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues.\nThe ESA, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and other laws intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our and our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers' operations, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our customers' ability to develop new oil and natural gas wells.\nIn the United States, the ESA and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Under the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species' habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (\"MBTA\"). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\") under former President Trump issued a final rule on January 7, 2021, which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the MBTA will apply only to actions \"directed at\" migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs; however, in 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated a DOI memorandum articulating a similar interpretation. We expect that the January 7 rulemaking will be subject to litigation or to reconsideration by the Biden Administration. Oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit our ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered and threatened species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures.\nMoreover, the FWS may make determinations on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause us to incur additional costs, cause our or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers' operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas, which could reduce demand for our products and services to those customers.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social & governance (\"ESG\") matters may impact our business.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer use of substitutes to energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our customers' hydrocarbon products and our services, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our customers' hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against those customers.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Additionally, certain investors use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG disclosure or performance. Moreover, certain\nmembers of the broader investment community may consider a company's sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our stock from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our operations by certain investors.", "PERMNO": 88897, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "OIS"}
