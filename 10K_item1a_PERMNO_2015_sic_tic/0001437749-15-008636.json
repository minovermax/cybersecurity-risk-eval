RISK FACTORS\nThere are many risk factors that affect our business and operating results, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of all known material risks that may cause our actual operating results in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. The following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business and operating results may be adversely affected by general adverse economic conditions.\nOur performance and operating results are impacted by conditions in the U.S. and the world economy. The macro-economic environment has been highly volatile in recent years due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the lagging demand in the housing market, lack of credit availability, unpredictable fuel and energy prices, volatile interest rates, inflation and deflation fears, unemployment concerns, increasing consumer debt, significant stock market volatility, and recession. These economic conditions negatively impact levels of consumer spending, which may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. General adverse economic conditions may affect consumer purchases of our merchandise and adversely impact our results of operations and continued growth. In addition, the slowing growth in China and the economic condition in Europe is causing a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. The impact of this environment on our major suppliers cannot be predicted. The inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to their failure to deliver our merchandise. Any or all of these factors, as well as other unforeseen factors, could have a material adverse impact on consumer spending, our ability to obtain financing, our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and stock price.\nWe are subject to intense competition in our business, which could have a material effect on our operations.\nCompetition is intense in the retail fabric and craft industry, primarily due to low entry barriers. We must remain competitive in the areas of quality, price, selection, customer service, convenience, and reputation.\nOur primary competition is comprised of specialty fabric retailers and specialty craft retailers such as Jo-Ann Stores, a national chain that operates fabric and craft stores. We also compete with mass merchants, including Wal-Mart, that dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of fabrics, craft supplies and seasonal and holiday merchandise. We also compete with Hobby Lobby, a national chain that operates craft stores that also carries fabrics, Michaels Stores, Inc., a national chain that operates craft and framing stores, and A.C. Moore Arts & Crafts, Inc., a regional chain that operates craft stores in the eastern United States. Some of our competitors have stores nationwide, several operate regional chains and numerous others are local merchants. Some of our competitors, particularly the national specialty chain stores and the mass merchants, are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. The performance of competitors as well as changes in their pricing and promotional policies, marketing activities, new store openings, merchandising and operational strategies could impact our sales and profitability. Our sales and profitability could also be impacted by store liquidations of our competitors. We also face competition from Internet-based retailers, such as Amazon.com, Inc., in addition to traditional store-based retailer, who may be larger, more experienced and able to offer products we cannot offer online. Such alternative methods of selling fabrics and crafts could result in additional competitors in the future and increased price competition since our customers could more readily comparison shop. Moreover, we ultimately compete against alternative sources of entertainment and leisure activities for our customers that are unrelated to the fabric and craft industry. This competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability.\nOur merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis may not provide expected results.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing. There is no assurance that we will be successful, or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers\u2019 needs or expectations. Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in customer demands and failure to manage inventory effectively could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur financial condition and operating results are dependent upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for our products. A miscalculation in the anticipated demands of our customers could result in a significant overstock of unpopular products which could lead to major inventory markdowns, resulting in negative consequences to our operating results and cash flow. Likewise, a shortage of popular products could lead to negative operating results and cash flow. In addition, inventory shrink (inventory theft or loss) rates and failure to manage such rates could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur inability to effectively implement our growth strategy may have an adverse effect on sales growth\nOur growth strategy includes relocating or remodeling existing stores, opening new stores and introducing changes to our merchandise assortments, among others. Certain risks involved with implementing these strategies may not be adequately addressed, and future sales and operating results may be less than anticipated, which may negatively impact the return on investment. Future growth and profitability is dependent upon the successful implementation of our growth strategy and realizing positive returns on investments.\nOur ability to attract and retain skilled people is important to our success.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to retain key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in retail matters and in operating a company of our size and complexity. The unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business because of the unique skills, knowledge of our markets and products, and years of industry experience such personnel contribute to the business and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. We offer financial packages that are competitive within the industry to effectively compete in this area.\nInterest rate increases could negatively impact profitability.\nOur financing, investing, and cash management activities are subject to the market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Our profitability could be negatively impacted by significant increases in interest rates.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us.\nAt January 31, 2015, we had outstanding long-term indebtedness of $84.7 million. Our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:\n\u25cf\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nexhausting the amount available to borrow under our current credit lines if operating results do not improve;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf\nrequiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our ability to fund the required cash contributions to the defined benefit pension plan; and\n\u25cf\nlimiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.\nAs a consequence of our level of indebtedness, a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements. In addition, the terms of our revolving credit facility limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants, a default may occur, in which case the lender could accelerate the debt. We cannot assure you that we would be able to renegotiate, refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations.\nOur business is dependent on the ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial institutions and any inability to access funds may limit our ability to execute our business plan and restrict operations we rely on for future growth.\nOur business is dependent on the availability of credit to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements. Our credit facilities are scheduled to expire on November 15, 2016 and our floating rate secured notes mature on November 20, 2017. On April 22, 2015, the Company refinanced its existing credit facility with a new credit agreement which provides for senior secured financing of $117.5 million, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements - Subsequent Events. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain replacement financing at the expiration of the new facility on acceptable terms or at all. While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and our available sources of financing for the next twelve months, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to do so for the long-term. If we are unable to access financial markets at competitive rates, our ability to implement our business plan and strategy will be negatively affected.\nSignificant changes in discount rates, mortality rates, actual investment return on pension assets, and other factors could affect our earnings, equity, and pension contributions in future periods.\nOur earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense recorded for our qualified benefit pension plan. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) require that income or expense for the plan be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial assumptions and calculations. These calculations reflect certain assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the capital markets, interest rates and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant assumptions used to estimate pension income or expense for the year are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the interest rate. These assumptions, along with the actual value of assets at the measurement date, will drive the pension income or expense for the year. In addition, at the measurement date, we must reflect the funded status of the plan liabilities on the balance sheet, which may result in a significant charge to equity through a reduction or increase to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). In 2014, an increase in Pension and SERP liabilities from $28.4 million to $43.8 million caused a shareholders\u2019 deficit and an increase of $18.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension plan. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve a plan\u2019s funded status.\nBusiness matters encountered by our suppliers may adversely impact our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nMany of our suppliers are small businesses that produce a limited number of items. Many of these businesses face cash flow constraints, production difficulties, quality control issues, and problems in delivering agreed-upon quantities on schedule because of their limited resources and lack of financial flexibility. Many of our vendors rely on third parties for working capital loans. The third parties\u2019 evaluation of our credit worthiness can significantly impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to produce and deliver product. Failure of our key suppliers to withstand a downturn in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs. In addition, the significant product safety requirements arising under the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 and state product safety laws may represent a compliance challenge to some of our suppliers, could negatively impact the ability of such suppliers to deliver compliant products to us and thus negatively impact our business operations and performance. Delivery of non-compliant products could result in liability to our company; while we obtain indemnifications from our suppliers with respect to compliance issues, some suppliers might not have the financial resources to stand behind their indemnifications and we could also suffer damage to our reputation.\nWe are vulnerable to risks associated with obtaining merchandise from foreign suppliers.\nWe rely on foreign suppliers, many of whom are located primarily in China and other Asian countries, for the majority of our products. In addition, some of our domestic suppliers manufacture their products overseas or purchase them from foreign vendors. Foreign sourcing subjects us to a number of risks, including long lead times; work stoppages; transportation delays (including dock strikes and other work stoppages) and interruptions; product quality issues; employee rights issues; other social concerns; political instability; economic disruptions; the imposition of tariffs, duties, quotas, import and export controls and other trade restrictions; changes in governmental policies; and other events. If any of these events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, reductions in the value of the U.S. dollar or revaluation of the Chinese currency, or other foreign currencies, could ultimately increase the prices that we pay for our products. All of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the United States are subject to duties collected by the United States Customs Service. We may be subjected to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of import privileges, if we or our suppliers are found to be in violation of U.S. laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products.\nTransportation industry challenges and rising fuel costs may negatively impact our operating results.\nOur products are delivered to our distribution center from vendors and from our distribution center to our stores by various means of transportation. Our ability to furnish our stores with inventory in a timely manner could be adversely affected by labor or equipment shortages in the transportation industry as well as long-term interruptions of service in the national and international transportation infrastructure. In addition, labor shortages and increases in fuel prices could lead to higher transportation costs. With our reliance on the trucking industry to deliver products to our distribution center and our stores, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to secure adequate trucking resources to fulfill our delivery schedules to the stores or if transportation costs increase.\nDelays or interruptions in the flow of merchandise through our distribution center could adversely impact our operating results.\nApproximately 94% of our store shipments pass through our distribution center. The remainder of merchandise is drop-shipped by our vendors directly to our store locations. Damage or interruption to our distribution center from factors such as fire, power loss, storm damage or unanticipated supplier shipment delays could cause a disruption in our operations. The occurrence of unanticipated problems at our distribution center would likely result in increased operating expenses and reduced sales that would negatively impact our operating results.\nChanges in the labor market and in federal, state, or local regulations could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur products are delivered to our customers at our retail stores by quality associates, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions. Attracting and retaining a large number of dependable and knowledgeable associates is vital to our success. External factors, such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, workers compensation costs and changing demographics, affect our ability to manage employee turnover and meet labor needs while controlling our costs. Our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted by changes that adversely affect our ability to attract and retain quality associates.\nTaxing authorities could disagree with our tax treatment of certain deductions or transactions, resulting in unexpected tax assessments.\nThe possibility exists that the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities could audit our current or previously filed tax returns and dispute our treatment of tax deductions or apportionment formulas, resulting in unexpected assessments. Depending on the timing and amount of such assessments, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur current cash resources might not be sufficient to meet our expected near-term cash needs.\nDue to our history of losses over the three year period ended January 31, 2015, we have only generated positive operating cash flow in the year ended January 31, 2015, which was substantially less than the negative operating cash flows experienced in the prior two years. If we are unable to continue generating positive cash flow from operations in amounts significant enough to fund our plans, we will need to develop and implement alternative strategies. These alternative strategies could include seeking improvements in working capital management, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, seeking additional debt or financing, and selling assets. There can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, on a timely basis, or at all.\nA disruption in the performance of our information systems would negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business, including effective transaction processing, inventory management, purchasing, selling and shipping goods on a timely basis, and maintaining cost-efficient operations. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and cause information to be lost or delayed, which could have a negative impact on our business. Computer viruses, computer \u201chackers,\u201d or other system failures could lead to operational problems with our information systems. Our operations and financial performance could also be negatively impacted by costs and potential problems related to the implementation of new or upgraded systems, or if we were unable to provide maintenance and support for our existing systems.\nA failure to adequately maintain the security of confidential information could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have become more dependent upon automated information technology processes, including use of the internet for conducting a portion of our business. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. In connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information. Information may be compromised through various means, including penetration of our network security, hardware tampering, and misappropriation of confidential information. We have a program in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems changes frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors and temporary staff. Failure to maintain the security of confidential information could result in deterioration in our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 confidence in us, expose us to litigation and liability, and any breach in the security and integrity of other business information could put us at a competitive disadvantage, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur marketing programs, e-commerce initiatives and use of consumer information are governed by an evolving set of laws and enforcement trends and unfavorable changes in those laws or trends, or our failure to comply with existing or future laws, could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe collect, maintain and use data provided to us through our online activities and other customer interactions in our business. Our current and future marketing programs depend on our ability to collect, maintain and use this information, and our ability to do so is subject to certain contractual restrictions in third party contracts as well as evolving international, federal and state laws and enforcement trends. We strive to comply with all applicable laws and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, may conflict with other rules or may conflict with our practices. If so, we may suffer damage to our reputation and be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts to defend our practices, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, and result in monetary liability.\nIn addition, as data privacy and marketing laws change, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance. If applicable data privacy and marketing laws become more restrictive at the federal or state level, our compliance costs may increase, our ability to effectively engage customers via personalized marketing may decrease, our investment in our e-commerce platform may not be fully realized, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase.\nFailure to comply with various laws and regulations as well as litigation developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nOur policies, procedures, and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as applicable employment laws. We are involved in various litigation and arbitration matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including liability claims. Litigation and arbitration could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Also, failure to comply with the various laws and regulations may result in damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance, and restatements of financial statements.\nWe may not be able to maintain or negotiate favorable lease terms for our retail stores.\nWe lease substantially all of our store locations. The majority of our store leases contain provisions for base rent and a small number of store leases contain provisions for base rent plus percentage rent based on sales in excess of an agreed upon minimum annual sales level. If we are unable to renew, renegotiate or replace our store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, our growth and profitability could be harmed.\nChanges in accounting principles may have a negative impact on our reported results.\nA change in accounting standards or policies may have a significant impact on our reported results from operations. New accounting pronouncements and different interpretations of existing pronouncements have been issued and may be issued in the future. Implementation of these standards or policies may have a negative impact on our reported results.\nOur results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events, including geo-political events and weather.\nUnforeseen public health issues, such as pandemics and epidemics, and geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which our suppliers are located or terrorist or military activities disrupting transportation, communication or utility systems, as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, particularly during peak seasonal periods, could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas. Day to day operations, particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected, or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by the affected distribution center. These factors could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and global financial markets and economy. Such occurrences could significantly impact our operating results and financial performance. As a result, our business could be adversely affected.\nChanges in newspaper subscription rates may result in reduced exposure to our circular advertisements.\nA substantial portion of our promotional activities utilize circular advertisements in local newspapers. A continued decline in consumer subscriptions of these newspapers could reduce the frequency with which consumers receive our circular advertisements, thereby negatively affecting sales, results of operations and cash flow.\nUnexpected or unfavorable consumer responses to our promotional or merchandising programs could materially adversely affect our sales, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nBrand recognition, quality and price have a significant influence on consumers\u2019 choices among competing products and brands. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and new product introductions also have a significant impact on consumers\u2019 buying decisions. If we misjudge consumer responses to our existing or future promotional activities, this could have a material adverse impact on our sales, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe believe improvements in our merchandise offering help drive sales at our stores. We could be materially adversely affected by poor execution of changes to our merchandise offering or by unexpected consumer responses to changes in our merchandise offering.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere are risks associated with our common stock trading on the OTC Markets, formerly known as the \u201cPink Sheets\u201d.\nEffective May 4, 2007, our common stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, and there is currently no established public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets (formerly known as \u201cPink Sheets\u201d) under the symbol \u201cHKFI\u201d. The OTC Markets is a centralized quotation service that collects and publishes market maker quotes for over-the-counter securities in real time. Over-the-counter market quotations, like those on the OTC Markets, reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down, or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. Stocks trading in the OTC Markets generally have substantially less liquidity; consequently, it can be much more difficult for stockholders and broker/dealers to purchase and sell our shares in an orderly manner or at all. Due in part to the decreased trading price of our common stock and reduced analyst coverage, the trading price of our common stock may change quickly, and brokers may not be able to execute trades as quickly as they previously could when our common stock was listed on an exchange. Currently, we are not actively seeking to become listed on any exchange. There can be no assurance that our common stock will again be listed on an exchange, or that a trading market for our common stock will be established.\nOur stock price has been volatile and could decrease in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, in many cases unrelated to the financial performance of the companies. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock. Fluctuations in the market price of our common stock may be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u25cf\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products;\n\u25cf\npublic reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial markets or general economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nour ability to raise additional capital as needed;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding shares of our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally.\nFuture sales of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our future capital-raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities, which could result in a decline in the trading price of shares of our common stock.\nWe may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. We currently have outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 9,838,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock for an exercise price of $0.59 per share that are exercisable at any time until November 20, 2019 on a cashless basis pursuant to the terms of the warrants. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our executive management and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our-then-outstanding shares of our common stock. The market price for shares of our common stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. The Company\u2019s credit facilities also contain covenants restricting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions.", "PERMNO": 75066, "SIC": 5940, "TIC": "HKFIQ"}
