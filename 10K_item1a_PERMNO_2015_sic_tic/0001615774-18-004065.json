RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risk factors listed below. Risks and uncertainties in addition to those we describe below, that may not be presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also harm our business and operations in the future. If any of these risks occur, our business, and its future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed, the price of shares of our common stock could decline, and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those expected that are set forth in or underlie the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nRisks related to our industry\nThe industry is subject to extensive state and federal regulations, as well as diverse licensure requirements varying by state. Changes in regulations could affect the profitability of our contracts or our ability to retain clients or to gain new customers.\nWe are required to hold licenses or certificates to perform utilization review and/or TPA services in California, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Additional utilization review or TPA licenses may be required in the future, and we may not qualify to obtain new licenses or renew existing licenses. In many states in which we provide services, entities that assume risk under contract with licensed insurance companies or health plans have not been considered by state regulators to be conducting an insurance or HMO business. As a result, we have not sought licensure as either an insurer or HMO in any state. If the regulatory positions of these states were to change, our business could be materially affected until such time, if any, as we are able to meet the regulatory requirements, if at all. Additionally, some states may decide to contract directly with enterprises such as ours for managed behavioral healthcare services, in which case they may also require us to meet or exceed regulatory net worth requirements that we may not readily be able to meet. Currently, we cannot quantify the potential effects of additional regulation, if any, of the managed care industry.\nThe status and future effect of healthcare reform in the U.S. is uncertain.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 contain provisions that may, among other things, reduce government payments for healthcare services, and is currently subject to political controversy and significant uncertainty. We cannot predict the effect of this legislation and any future changes therein on our business.\n- 11 -\nHealthcare organizations could be adversely affected in 2013 and 2014 by costs associated with adoption of the new federally mandated ICD-10 standardized coding set for diagnoses.\nThe federal government will require that healthcare organizations adopt updated and expanded standardized code sets (known as ICD-10) effective October 2014 for documenting health diagnoses. These new standardized code will require us to make additional investments that could be significant.\nWe can be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local healthcare policies, programs, funding and enrollments.\nAt December 31, 2014, all of our business was attributable to health plans serving Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP members. We are unable to predict the impact on our operations of future regulations or legislation affecting these programs, or the healthcare industry in general, and future regulations or legislation may have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, any reduction in government spending for such programs may also have a material adverse effect.\nWe are subject to federal statutes prohibiting false claims.\nThe Federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims with respect to governmental programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for services not rendered, or for misrepresenting actual services rendered, in order to obtain higher reimbursement. Although we do not directly provide services to beneficiaries of federally funded health programs and, accordingly, do not submit claims to the federal government, we do provide services to health plans that could become subject to allegations about false claims, which could, in turn, result in allegations against us as well.\nFailure to adequately comply with HIPAA may result in penalties.\nOur industry is subject to the security and privacy requirements of HIPAA relative to patients\u2019 health information. Although we believe we are fully compliant with all HIPAA regulations, any assertions of lack of compliance with HIPAA regulations could result in penalties and have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain our customers or to gain new business.\nThe managed care industry is often subject to class action lawsuits and claims for professional liability that could increase our future costs and expenses.\nIn recent years, the managed care industry has been subjected to a greater number of lawsuits and claims of professional liability alleging negligence in performing utilization review and other managed care activities and for denial of payment for services. Such incidents could result in professional negligence or other claims against us causing us to incur fees and expend substantial resources in defense of such actions in excess of the limits of our professional liability insurance.\n- 12 -\nRisks related to our business\nIn addition to all of the foregoing general industry-related risks that may particularly affect our business, we are also subject to the following more particular risks:\nOur auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have experienced a significant decrease in operating revenues beginning January 1, 2013 due to the loss of our major contract in Puerto Rico on December 31, 2012. On December 30, 2013, we sold CBC which eliminated our revenue from at-risk contracts. The loss of these contracts and our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations and sustain our operations raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our future is dependent on our ability to execute our business and liquidity plans successfully. If we fail to do so for any reason, this will affect our ability to continue as a going concern in which event investors could lose their entire investment in the Company. Accordingly, in their audit report dated May 10, 2018 on our consolidated financial statements contained herein, our auditors expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the auditors in their Report cited their inability to obtain sufficient appropriate evidential matter with regard to a cash receipts, cash disbursements and cutoff.\nDependence on our Chief Executive Officer.\nWe are dependent on the services of Mr. Clark A. Marcus, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of his services would have a material adverse effect on the performance and growth of our business for some period of time. We do not have any \u201cKey Man\u201d insurance for Mr. Marcus.\nThe sale of CBC severely decreased our revenue stream.\nIn December 2013, we sold CBE. CBC held all of the at-risk contracts and ASO contracts and the provider network contracts which were the extent of our business operations. This action while limiting our losses severely decreased our cash flow. As a result, we will need to obtain additional sources of revenue or obtain financing from other sources. Our ability to support our cost structure could be adversely affected.\nOur existing and potential managed care clients operate in a highly competitive environment and may be subject to a higher rate of merger, acquisition, and regulation than in other industries.\nOur clients may decide to manage the behavioral healthcare benefits \u201cin-house\u201d and, as a result, discontinue contracting with us. For example, our Puerto Rico client terminated its contract with us as of December 31, 2012 and is now managing its members\u2019 behavioral benefit internally. The loss of this contract resulted in a decrease of approximately 83% of our revenue. Additionally, our small to medium-sized health plan clients may be acquired by larger health plans, resulting in non-renewals of our contracts.\nOur inability to renew, extend or replace expiring or terminated contracts in the near term could adversely affect our liquidity, profitability and financial condition.\nMany of the contracts we service could be terminated immediately either for cause or without cause by the client upon notice of a specified time (typically between 60 and 120 days). The loss of one of these contracts could materially reduce our net revenue and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, profitability and financial condition.\nMany of our clients provide services to groups covered by Medicare, Medicaid and/or CHIP programs. Such federal and state controlled programs are susceptible to annual changes in reimbursement rates and eligibility requirements.\nAny changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and/or CHIP reimbursement could ultimately affect us adversely through contract bidding and cost structures with the health plans affected by such change, especially if we are unable to adapt to the differing needs of our Medicare members and the Medicare regulations. Also, because governmental healthcare programs account for such a large portion of state budgets, efforts to contain overall government spending could result in a significant decrease in healthcare programs.\n- 13 -\nTemporary reductions in governmental funding for Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP programs have previously had an adverse impact on us that could continue. In addition, states in which we operate may pass legislation that would further reduce our revenue from such sources or increase our claims expense through changes in the reimbursement rates, changes in the benefit covered, or in the number of eligible participants. We may be unable to reduce our costs to a level that would allow us to maintain current gross margins specific to our Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP programs.\nWe rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by our clients to collect premiums and to pay claims. Any inaccuracies in those lists may cause our clients to recoup premium payments from us or for us to pay claims inappropriately.\nPremium payments that we receive and claims payments that we make are based on eligibility lists that are produced and maintained by our clients. We are required to reimburse our clients for premiums received based on an eligibility list that the client may later discover contains individuals who were not eligible. Our review of all remittance files to identify potential duplicate members, members that should be terminated or members for which we have been paid an incorrect rate may not identify all such members and could result in repayment of premiums or claims that we paid incorrectly and for which we are unable to recover.\nWe must estimate the amount of claims incurred but not reported, and actual claims ultimately reported may differ materially.\nOur costs of care include estimated amounts for claims incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d). These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in utilization and other factors and at times may be inadequate.\nWe may be subject to regulatory fines and penalties.\nFrom time to time, we receive notifications from various state agencies concerning our business and operations. Many of our contracts contain provisions stating that we are responsible for regulatory penalties or fines assessed to the client that are due to our noncompliance with a contractual requirement. Our inability to comply with these contractual or regulatory requirements may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA failure of our information systems could significantly impair our ability to serve our customers and manage our business.\nAn effective and secure information system, available at all times, is vital to our health plan customers and their members. We depend on our computer systems for significant service and management functions, such as providing membership verification, monitoring utilization, processing provider claims, and providing regulatory data and other client and managerial reports. Although our computer and communications hardware is protected by physical and software safeguards and other internal controls, it is still vulnerable to computer viruses and other technological threats, fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, or physical break-ins, and similar catastrophic events. We do not have 100% redundancy for all of our computer and telecommunications facilities. We also depend on a third-party provider of application services for our core business application. Any sustained disruption in their services to us would have a material negative effect on our business.\n- 14 -\nWe are subject to intense competition that may prevent us from gaining new customers or pricing our contracts at levels sufficient to achieve gross margins to ensure profitability.\nWe are continually pursuing new business. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and better capitalized than we are. Our smaller size and weak financial condition has been a deterrent to some prospective customers. Additionally, we will likely have difficulty in matching the financial resources expended on marketing by larger competitors. As a result, we may not be able to successfully compete in our industry in some respects, markets or instances.\nWe will require additional funding, and we cannot guarantee that we will find adequate sources of capital at acceptable terms in the future or that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our available cash will be sufficient to fund our business. We will need to seek new financing, possibly including, which cannot be assured, additional debt or equity or financing (which could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interests), we also cannot provide assurance that such additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to achieve these goals may affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may be unsuccessful in obtaining required performance bonds or other security, and consequently may lose clients.\nSome of our clients may require us to maintain performance bonds, restricted cash accounts, or other security with respect to our obligations to pay claims. Due to current market conditions or other factors, we may be unable to provide the security required by the client or prospect.\nClaims brought against us could exceed our insurance coverage.\nFrom time-to-time, we are subject to a variety of legal actions including provider disputes and breach of contract actions. Although we establish provisions for estimated litigation costs as we believe appropriate, we cannot provide assurance that our recorded provisions will be adequate to cover such costs. We maintain a program of insurance coverage against a broad range of risks related to our business. As part of this program of insurance, we are subject to certain deductibles and self-insured retentions. Our insurance limits or covered risks may not be sufficient to cover all judgments, settlements, or costs relating to future claims, suits or complaints. In addition, upon expiration of our insurance policies, we could find that sufficient.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThe success of our business is largely dependent on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team, such as our CEO, President, and Chief Financial Officer and others. We believe our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified technical, managerial, and marketing personnel will determine whether we meet our goals. The market for highly skilled sales, marketing and support personnel is highly competitive as a result of the limited availability of technically qualified personnel with the requisite understanding of the markets which we serve. The inability to hire or retain qualified personnel may hinder our ability to implement our business strategy and may harm our business.\n- 15 -\nRisks related to our common and preferred stock\nOur Series C Convertible Preferred stockholders have significant rights and preferences over the holders of our common stock and may be deemed to operate as an anti-takeover device.\nOur Series C Convertible Preferred stockholders are entitled to receive dividends when declared by our Board of Directors before dividends are paid on our common stock and also have a claim against our assets senior to the claim of the holders of our common stock in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up. The aggregate amount of that senior claim is currently $2,608,500. In addition, each Series C Convertible Preferred stockholder is entitled to vote together with the holders of our common stock on an \u201cas converted\u201d basis, and, voting together as a separate class, all holders have the right to elect five of our nine directors to our Board of Directors. The holders by their ability to control a majority of our Directors may be deemed to be an anti-takeover device.\nThe holders of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock have other rights and preferences as detailed elsewhere in this report. These rights and preferences could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations, satisfy capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.\nOur Series D Convertible Preferred stockholders have significant rights and preferences over the holders of our common stock and may be deemed to operate as an anti-takeover device.\nWe also have a class of convertible preferred stock, Series D, for which 7,000 shares are authorized and 250 shares have been issued. Subject to certain conditions, the shares do not vest until the tenth anniversary of the grant date of January 4, 2012, at which time the each share will be convertible into 100,000 shares of common stock. Prior to vesting and thereafter, each Series D convertible preferred share is entitled to all voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights accorded a share of Series D convertible preferred stock. If a dividend is declared on the common stock, each share of Series D stock is entitled to receive a dividend equal to 50% of the dividend declared for the common stock as if the Series D stock had been converted. Despite their nonvested status, voting rights of each share nevertheless consist of the right to cast the number of votes equal to those of 500,000 shares of common stock. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, holders of shares of Series D have the right to vote together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The holders by virtue of their superior voting rights may be deemed to operate as an anti-takeover device.\nWe may raise additional funds in the future through issuances of securities and such additional funding may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions.\nTo fund acquisitions, sales expansions and our operations, we may raise additional capital in the future through sales of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock. Such additional financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve significant interest costs and/or restrictive covenants which may limit our operating flexibility.\n- 16 -\nWe are not subject to certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other requirements of the federal securities laws and regulations, and accordingly neither the Company nor its investors may receive the benefits and protections they were enacted to provide.\nSince we are a smaller reporting entity, and since our common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange, we are not subject to certain of the more robust requirements of the federal securities laws and regulations and the large stock exchanges, including, but not limited to many disclosure requirements of Regulation S-X, certain corporate governance rules and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including Section 404(b), which, if applicable, would require our independent auditors to report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The corporate governance rules that do not apply to us relate to independent director standards, director nomination procedures, audit and compensation committees standards, the use of an audit committee financial expert and the adoption of a code of ethics, some of which we nevertheless comply with voluntarily in some significant respects.\nApplicable SEC rules governing the trading of \u201cpenny stocks\u201d may limit the trading and liquidity of our common stock which, along with our small public capitalization may affect the trading price of our common stock and may subject us to securities litigation.\nOur common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined under Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act and is accordingly subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our common stock may be publicly traded. These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks. Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination regarding such a purchaser and receive such purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. These regulations may have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock. In addition, the size of our public market capitalization is relatively small, resulting in highly limited trading volume in, and high volatility in the price of, our common stock.\nWe expect that our per share price will continue to be volatile for the indefinite future. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against a company by investors following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Accordingly we could be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation, if it were to occur, even if we were to successfully defend it, would likely result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and other Company resources.", "PERMNO": 25583, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "CHCR"}
