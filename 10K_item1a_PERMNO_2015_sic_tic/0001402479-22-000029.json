Risk Factors\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Please also see \u201cCautionary Notes Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisk Factors Summary\nBelow is a summary of some of the more significant risks and uncertainties we face. This summary is not exhaustive and is qualified by reference to the full set of risk factors set forth in this Part I, Item A. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our company risky include, among others:\n\u2022We have determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we will need additional financings to execute our business plan and to fund our operations.\n\u2022Our pharmacy business is dependent upon access to payor networks. If we are not able to maintain adequate levels of third-party coverage and reimbursement for our pharmacy drug sales, if third parties rescind or modify their coverage, or if patients are left with significant out-of-pocket costs, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We rely on a limited number of prescription drug wholesalers to supply our pharmacies. The loss of any of these relationships and/or fluctuations in pharmaceutical prices could disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022The retail pharmacy market is highly competitive. If our competitors are able to develop new products and services that gain greater acceptance in the marketplace than any products and services we develop, our commercial opportunities will be reduced. If our competitors are better able to respond to changes in market dynamics, our business position, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022Our technology business is dependent upon clinics adopting our MedCenters, and if we fail to obtain broad adoption, our business would be adversely affected.\n\u2022We rely on Kitron Technologies, or Kitron, to manufacture our MedCenters, which makes us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We have a history of net losses, which we expect to continue, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n\u2022General market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including deteriorating market conditions due to investor concerns regarding inflation and ongoing military activity between Russia and Ukraine.\n\u2022The military action launched by Russian forces in Ukraine, the actions that have been and could be taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions and actions taken in response to such sanctions, have impacted, and may continue to impact, our business and results of operations, including our supply chains.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have impacted, and may in the future periods negatively impact, our business and operations.\n\u2022We may become a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell and market our products.\n\u2022Changes in the regulatory environment may constrain or require us to restructure our operations, which may harm our revenue and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe are an early-stage company with a history of net losses, and expect to incur operating losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. We have a limited history operating as a commercial company and have determined that there is substantial doubt\nabout our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need additional financings to execute our business plan and to fund our operations.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in 2012. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net losses of $43.8 million, and $26.8 million, respectively, and we expect to continue to incur additional losses in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $192.1 million. To date, we financed our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and from deployments of our MedCenter kiosk solution and the operation of our full-service retail pharmacy platform. Our ability to obtain financing is subject to multiple risks, many of which are beyond our control. We have and will continue to monitor our recurring operation costs, and we intend to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations and grow our business and are exploring options to raise capital. However, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. To the extent that we are unable to do so, we may need to curtail or cease our operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. We do not yet generate sufficient revenues from our operations to fund our activities and are therefore dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. As a result, our financial statements include disclosures expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. This disclosure with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities or otherwise. Future reports on our financial statements may continue to include such disclosures. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in our common stock. The losses and accumulated deficit have primarily been due to the substantial investments that we have made to develop our products, as well as for costs related to general research and development, including clinical and regulatory initiatives to obtain marketing approval, sales and marketing efforts and infrastructure improvements.\nWe began commercializing our products in the United States in 2016 and therefore do not have a long history operating as a commercial company. Over the next several years, we expect to continue to devote a substantial amount of our resources to, among other matters, expand commercialization efforts, increase adoption for our products and develop additional products. In addition, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and we cannot assure that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we become profitable, that we will sustain profitability. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will make it more difficult to finance our business and accomplish our strategic objectives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, failure of our products to significantly penetrate the target markets would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur core technology the MedCenter has been in market since 2015 at limited volume. Over the past three years we opened our own retail pharmacy, SpotRx Pharmacy, which focuses on the Medicare Provider market. This new focus comprises a substantial portion of our current revenue, and thus the model has a limited operating history; this makes it difficult to predict our future operating results.\nWe began shipping our first products in 2015. Given the constantly evolving market for retail pharmacy, regulatory changes to government healthcare programs and the constant competitive pressures in this market, our limited operating history with this market provides a limited basis upon which to evaluate our ability to accomplish our business objectives. We are in the early stages of deployment, and there are many risks associated with the rapidly changing retail pharmacy and Medicare market. We may not be successful in addressing these risks; and our limited operating history adds to the difficulty in forecasting our future revenue and planning expenses accordingly and, therefore, predicting our future operating results.\nWe face risks relating to the availability, pricing and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell.\nOur path to profitability is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. We dispense significant volumes of brand name and generic drugs. Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions for drugs or the utilization of drugs is reduced due to:\n\u2022increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022manufacturing or other supply issues;\n\u2022certain products being withdrawn by their manufacturers or transitioned to over-the-counter products;\n\u2022future FDA rulings restricting the supply or increasing the cost of products;\n\u2022the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs or lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products; or\n\u2022inflation in the price of brand name drugs.\nIn addition, increased utilization of generic drugs, which normally yield a higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drugs, has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to us and pharmacies in general for generic drugs, causing a reduction in our margins on sales of generic drugs. Consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic drugs and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe purchase a significant amount of prescription drugs from a limited number of wholesalers. The loss of any of these relationships could disrupt our business and adversely impact our revenues for one or more fiscal quarters.\nThe loss of any of these relationships, the failure by the suppliers to fulfill our purchase orders on a timely basis or at all, or a contractual dispute could significantly disrupt our business and adversely impact our revenues for one or more fiscal quarters. In the event of a contractual dispute, we could become involved in litigation, the outcome of which may be uncertain or difficult to predict and could result in our incurrence of substantial costs regardless of the outcome.\nOur business could also be harmed by any governmental enforcement actions, regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, or similar actions, or similar private proceedings, that would alter how drug manufacturers promote or sell products and services.\nThe specialty pharmacy and pharmacy benefit managers, or PBM, industries are highly litigious and future litigation or other proceedings could subject us to significant monetary damages or penalties or require us to change our business practices, which could impair our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation, enforcement actions, regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations, and other similar actions in connection with our business operations. While we are currently not subject to any material litigation of this nature relating to our business operations, such litigation is not unusual in our industry. Further, while certain costs are covered by insurance, we may incur uninsured costs related to the defense of such proceedings that could be material to our financial performance. In addition, any material decline in the market price of our common stock may expose us as a public company to purported class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend or indemnify (to the extent not covered by insurance) and a distraction to management. The results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements, materially change our business practices or technologies or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters. In addition, the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. If one or more of these proceedings or any future proceeding has an unfavorable outcome, we cannot provide any assurance it would not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, including our ability to attract and retain clients as a result of any negative reputational impact of such an outcome.\nOur products, both hardware and software, are complex and require precision in design and manufacturing. Any errors in product performance could result in significant harm to our reputation and our business.\nThe development and production of new products with high technology content, such as our MedCenter Kiosk, is complicated and often involves problems with software, components and manufacturing methods. Our products have contained and may continue to contain one or more undetected errors, defects or security vulnerabilities. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by consumers. We suspect that errors, including potentially serious errors, may be found from time to time in our products. Our MedCenter Kiosk may suffer degradation of performance and reliability over time. Furthermore, because we outsource the manufacturing of almost all of the key hardware components of our MedCenter Kiosk, we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of these third parties.\nIf reliability, quality or other problems develop, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including:\n\u2022costs associated with fixing or replacing products;\n\u2022reduced orders from existing customers; and\n\u2022declining interest from potential customers.\nReduced access to payor networks would have significant impact to our business.\nAccess to payor networks which reimburse our pharmacy upon dispense is renewed on an annual basis. Any inability to renew in a network would exclude us from filling prescriptions for those Medicare patients and impact our ability to operate.\nWe experienced significant growth, and if we are unable to manage our administrative and operational infrastructures in view of this growth, then we will suffer significant harm.\nWe will require further expansion of our infrastructure and headcount if we are to achieve planned expansion of our product offerings and planned increases in our customer base. Our growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to refine our operational, financial and management controls, human resource policies, and reporting systems and procedures.\nWe may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. If we are unable to manage future expansion, our ability to provide high quality products and services could be harmed, which would damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on access to clinics and need to maintain good working relationships with the clinics in order to continue to grow our business.\nWe are dependent upon access to clinics to acquire customers and run our MedCenter Kiosks at sites where treatment is rendered and prescriptions generated. We need to continue to have access to clinics in order to acquire new customers to grow our business. We must maintain good working relationships with the managers of those clinics. In the event that we do not maintain those relationships we may lose access to clinics and that may have a material and adverse relationship on our ability to grow and will negatively impact the results of our operations as a result.\nOur business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives.\nIf we are unable to continually obtain productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur recent management and board transition may divert resources and attention from the daily operation of our business\nWe believe that our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior executive management team and the members of our board of directors. Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us. Our future success also depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key management and operating personnel. We completed our previously announced Chief Executive Officer transition, Chief Financial Officer transition, Chief Pharmacy Officer transition, and changes to our Board of Directors on January 10, 2022. These transitions or other transitions in the future may create uncertainty and involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily operations or impact public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate effectively or execute our strategies and result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our businesses, operating results and/or future performance.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives. There is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased compensation and/or benefits costs. In addition, our success is highly dependent on the services of key members of our executive management team and others in key management positions. Any of our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time. If we lose one or more key employees, or are unable to retain existing employees, or attract additional employees, or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership again at the executive level, then we may experience difficulties in competing effectively, developing our technologies, or implementing our business strategy, and, as a result, we could experience a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and/or future performance.\nIn addition, our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and/or future performance. The succession plans we have in place and our employment arrangements with certain key executives do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us.\nIf we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, that could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny.\nThe protection of customer, employee, and our data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a breach of customer, employee, or company data, could create significant workflow disruption, attract substantial media attention, damage our customer relationships, reputation and brand, and result in lost sales, claims, demands or lawsuits from private parties, investigations and other proceedings by governmental authorities, and fines, penalties, and other liabilities. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Like other global companies, we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to access, use, misappropriate, or otherwise process, customer information, including credit card information, and other information of ours or our service providers processor maintain, and cause system failures and disruptions. Our security measures and those of our third-party service providers may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Any security breach or incident or other compromise of our data security systems or measures or of those of our service providers or other businesses with whom we interact, which results in disruption to our business or operations or personal information, intellectual property, or other confidential or sensitive information being accessed, obtained, damaged, rendered unavailable, lost, used, or otherwise processed by unauthorized or improper persons, or any perception that any of the foregoing have occurred, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory investigations, proceedings, and other actions, customer attrition, harm to our market position, expenses to remediate and otherwise respond to the incident, and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disrupt, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of having occurred, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, and we may face difficulties or delays in identifying or responding to security breaches and incidents. In addition, a security breach or incident could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. These risks may be increased as a result of an increase in personnel working remotely.\nWe depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including payors, strategic partners and cloud service providers. These third parties may have access to information it maintains about us or our operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. Like us, these third-parties are subject to risks imposed by security breaches and incidents and cyber-attacks and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt, or close down their networks or systems or result in unauthorized access to or processing of information stored on or otherwise processed by such networks or systems. Any expansion of information technology outsourcing, including through arrangements with our strategic partners, may increase vulnerabilities and weaknesses relating to cybersecurity and data management. Security processes, protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such third-parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events, which could result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, or misuse , unauthorized acquisition, use, disclosure or other unauthorized processing of, information or systems that are important to our business, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection, use, transfer and other processing of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. In the United States, for example, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the health care industry, including health care providers such as pharmacies, and their business associates. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of \u201cpersonal information\u201d of California residents, which term is broadly defined to include, among other things, information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked to a consumer or household. In addition, it is anticipated that the California Consumer Privacy Act will be expanded on January 1, 2023, when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 becomes operative. Other U.S. states have enacted, or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data. In addition, the U.S. federal government is considering federal privacy legislation. Outside the United States, many of our business units operate in countries with stringent data protection regulations, and these laws continue to change. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and provides for greater penalties for\nnoncompliance. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders.\nNew and evolving legal and regulatory requirements associated with privacy, data protection, and information security, and our efforts to comply with them, require us to incur substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and operating results. We may also face audits, investigations or other proceedings by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these laws and regulations, and may face claims, demands, and litigation from private parties relating to any actual or asserted failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations. Compliance with new and evolving privacy, data protection, and information security laws, standards, and other actual or asserted obligations may result in significant expense due to factors such as requirements for increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share or permit to process information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach or incident, or any of these events is perceived to have occurred, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks, particularly to the extent the breach relates to sensitive data.\nWith laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other obligations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our service providers to comply with applicable policies or notices relating to privacy or data protection, contractual or other obligations to third parties, or any other actual or asserted legal obligations relating to privacy or data protection, may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims and other proceedings, harm our reputation and market position, and could result in significant liability.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any insurance we maintain will be adequate or otherwise protect us from or adequately mitigate liabilities or damages with respect to claims, costs, expenses, litigation, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, regulatory actions or material adverse effects arising out of our privacy, data protection, or data security practices, or that such coverage will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nOur business success and operating results depend in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology. Pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly more challenging.\nMany aspects of our operations are dependent on our information systems and the information collected, processed, stored, and handled by these systems. We rely heavily on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, claims processing, customer loyalty and subscription programs, finance and other processes. Throughout our operations, we collect, process, maintain, retain, evaluate, utilize and distribute large amounts of confidential and sensitive data and information, including personally identifiable information and protected health information, that our customers, members and other constituents provide to purchase products or services, enroll in programs or services, register on our websites, interact with our personnel, or otherwise communicates with us. In addition, for these operations, we depend in part on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.\nWe have many different information and other technology systems supporting our businesses. Our businesses depend in large part on these systems to adequately price our products and services; accurately establish reserves, process claims and report operating results; and interact with providers, employer plan sponsors, customers, members, consumers and vendors in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion. In addition, recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Certain of our technology systems, including software, are older, legacy systems that are less flexible, less efficient and require a significant ongoing commitment of capital and human resources to maintain, protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other systems. We must re-engineer and reduce the number of these systems to meet changing consumer and vendor preferences and needs, improve our productivity and reduce our operating expenses. We also need to develop or acquire new technology systems, contract with new vendors or modify certain of our existing systems to support the consumer-oriented and transformation products and services we are developing, operating and expanding and/or to meet current and developing industry and regulatory standards, including to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risks and threats. If we fail to achieve these objectives, our ability to profitably grow our business and/or our operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, information technology and other technology and process improvement projects frequently are long-term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete. If we do not effectively and efficiently secure, manage, integrate and enhance our technology portfolio, including vendor sourced systems, we could, among other\nthings, have problems determining health care and other benefit cost estimates and/or establishing appropriate pricing, meeting the needs of customers, consumers, providers, members and vendors, developing and expanding our consumer-oriented products and services or keeping pace with industry and regulatory standards, and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labeling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. For example, from time to time, the FDA issues statements alerting patients that products in our and other pharmacies supply chains may contain impurities or harmful substances, and claims relating to the sale or distribution of such products may be asserted against us or arise from these statements. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and third-party indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future.\nChanges in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.\nOur performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include the impact of COVID-19 and any future pandemics, unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes.\nIn addition, inflationary pressures and shortages have increased and we expect will continue to increase costs for certain materials, components, supplies and services. If these effects continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified in this risk factors section could be heightened. We determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term. As a result, a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter to quarter. Failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe may experience inflationary pressures, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, which could increase our manufacturing costs and operating expenses and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe continuously monitor the effects of inflationary factors, such as increases in our cost of goods sold and selling and operating expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Specifically, we may experience inflationary pressure affecting the cost of the components for our MedCenter kiosks and in the wages that we pay our employees due to challenging labor market conditions. Competitive and regulatory conditions may restrict our ability to fully recover these costs through price increases. As a result, it may be difficult to fully offset the impact of persistent inflation. Our inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause us to need to obtain additional capital in future earlier than anticipated.\nWe could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, equity method investments, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for our reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested include a\nprolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate.\nWe may be required to pay significant penalties if we are not able to fulfill all of our registration requirements under an outstanding registration rights agreement.\nWe have registration rights obligations with respect to shares of Common Stock held by legacy MedAvail stockholders. Pursuant to these obligations, we filed a registration statement on May 12, 2021, which was declared effective as of May 14, 2021, and we have an obligation to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement until the earlier of (i) such time as such shares have been sold by such legacy stockholders or (ii) the date under which such shares could be sold in any 90 day period pursuant to Rule 144. The failure to keep such registration effective could result in the payment of liquidated damage by us, which could be as much as approximately $150,000 per month until the certain registration statement is re-declared effective. There can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreement.\nRisks Related to Insurance and Payments and Pricing and Reimbursement Plans\nSignificant and increasing pressure from third-party payors to limit reimbursements could materially and adversely impacts our profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state funded programs), and other third-party payors to limit pharmacy reimbursements, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings or governmental regulation related to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our profitability. While manufacturers have increased the price of drugs, payors have generally decreased reimbursement rates as a percentage of drug cost.\nPharmacy Benefit Managers:\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of PBM companies and health plans. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Reimbursements received from PBMs are determined pursuant to agreements. Should PBMs seek to negotiate reduced reimbursement rates or to adjust reimbursement rates downward, or change products covered under their formulary, this could negatively impact our profitability. In addition, PBMs may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in networks of pharmacy providers to comply with PBM demands. We may elect not to continue or enter into participation in a pharmacy provider network if reimbursements are too low. Should we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, we may not achieve the same level of business and clients or the PBMs may not choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans. In such events, we may incur increased marketing and other costs to offset these client losses through other strategic initiatives. As a result, we may lose sales, and if we are unable to replace any such lost sales, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nMedicare and Medicaid:\nReimbursement from government programs is subject to a myriad of requirements, including but not limited to statutory and regulatory, administrative rulings, interpretations, retroactive payment adjustments, governmental funding restrictions, and changes to, or introduction of, legislation, all of which may materially affect the amount and timing of reimbursement payments to us. These changes may reduce our revenue and profitability on services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients and increase our working capital requirements.\nThe utilization of Medicare Part D by cash and state Medicaid customers, with established pharmacy network payments based on actual acquisition cost, has resulted in increased utilization and decreased pharmacy gross margin rates. In addition, changes to Medicare Part D, such as the elimination of the tax deductibility of the retiree drug subsidy payment received by sponsors of retiree drug plans, could result in our PBM clients deciding to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members. To the extent this occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from the growth of our Medicare Part D business.\nGiven the significant competition in the industry, we have limited bargaining power to counter payor demands for reduced reimbursement rates. If we are unable to negotiate for acceptable reimbursement rates or replace unfavorable contracts with new business on acceptable terms, our revenues and business could be adversely affected. Should we experience a loss of sales as a result of reduced reimbursement rates and be unable to appropriately adjust staffing levels in a timely and efficient manner, this may negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nThere have been multiple executive, congressional and judicial attempts to modify or repeal the ACA. We cannot predict the success or effect any modification or repeal and any subsequent legislation would have on reimbursement levels. Furthermore, a third-party payor may not be able to pay timely, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us due to budgetary constraints or deterioration of financial condition. Recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe amount of DIR fees charged by PBMs, as well as the timing of assessing such fees and the methodology in calculating such fees, may have a material adverse impact on our financial performance and, to the extent such fees are material, may limit our ability to provide accurate financial guidance for future periods.\nSome PBMs charge certain direct and indirect remuneration, or DIR, fees, often calculated and charged several months after adjudication of a claim, which adversely impacts our profitability. DIR fees is a term used by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to address price concessions that ultimately may impact the prescription drug reimbursement of Medicare Part D plans, but are not captured at the point of sale. Further, the timing of assessments, changes in the manner in which DIR fees are assessed and methodology in computing DIR fees may materially impact our ability to provide accurate financial guidance to investors and analysts, and may result in a future change in the estimated DIR fees we have recognized. In addition, as reimbursement pressure increases throughout the industry and as our business grows, the amount of DIR fees assessed is expected to increase, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nShifts in pharmacy mix toward lower margin drugs could negatively impact our financial condition.\nA shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards lower margin drugs could negatively impact our financial condition. If our prescription volume shifts towards lower margin drugs or drugs with lower reimbursement rates and we are not able to generate additional prescription volume or other business that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower margin or reimbursement rates decline from current levels in future years, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIndustry pricing benchmarks may change, negatively impacting the revenue we derive from product sales.\nIt is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, or AWP, which is the pricing reference used for many pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of specialty drug payments. Future changes to the use of AWP or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could negatively impact our pricing arrangements. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time.\nPrograms funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that percentage to increase over time.\nPrograms funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we expect that percentage to increase. As our government funded businesses grow, our exposure to changes in federal and state government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the various government funded programs in which we participate also increases.\nOur revenues from government funded programs are dependent on annual funding by the federal government and/or applicable state or local governments. Funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities.\nAn extended federal government shutdown or a delay by Congress in raising the federal government\u2019s debt ceiling also could lead to a delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and a significant increase in interest rates that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, our ability to access the capital markets and our businesses, operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.\nThe profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. Inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their\nintroduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. New entrants to the market, existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us.\nThe market for retail medication pharmacy is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. The market is subject to changing technology trends, shifting customer needs and expectations and frequent introduction of new products. We expect competition to persist and intensify in the future as the market for retail pharmacy grows and new and existing competitors devote considerable resources to introducing and enhancing products and services. We face competition from several of the world\u2019s largest providers that provide alternatives, including Genoa, which was acquired by OptumRx, as well as major chains such as Walgreens, CVS, Walmart and Rite Aid.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, many of our competitors have more extensive customer relationships than we do, and, therefore, our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to market or sell their products more effectively. Moreover, further consolidation in the retail pharmacy market could adversely affect our customer relationships and competitive position. Our services may not continue to compete favorably. We may not be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and services introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering the markets in which we operate.\nThe level of competition in the retail pharmacy industry is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation, or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation, by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. We face intense competition including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Competition may also come from other sources in the future.\nWe also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. As technology, consumer behavior, omni-channel and differential retail models, and market conditions continue to evolve in the United States, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and product and service offerings to customers and patients.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with significant market power, and we expect such trend to continue. For example, in November 2018 CVS acquired Aetna and in December 2018 Cigna acquired Express Scripts. As provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate, thereby decreasing the number of market participants, competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense, and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater. In addition, industry participants may try to use their increased market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants with whom we engage. If we are forced to reduce prices as a result of either an imbalance of market power or decreased demand for our products, revenue would be reduced, and we could become significantly less profitable.\nEach of our segments operates in a highly competitive and evolving business environment; and gross margins in the industries in which we compete may decline.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and evolving business environment. Specifically:\n\u2022As competition increases in the geographies in which we operate, including competition from new entrants, a significant increase in price compression and/or reimbursement pressures could occur, and this could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive.\n\u2022Our success is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with network pharmacies as PBM clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks.\n\u2022Our competitive advantage is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationships with PBMs and other payors on acceptable terms as the payors\u2019 clients evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy networks.\nIn addition, competitors in each of our businesses may offer services and pricing terms that it may not be willing or able to offer. Competition also may come from new entrants and other sources in the future. Unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our clients through innovative product and service offerings in the rapidly changing health care industry, we may be unable to remain competitive.\nDisruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such alterations and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. Consumers also are increasingly seeking to access consumer goods and health care products and services locally and through other direct channels such as mobile devices and websites. To compete effectively in the consumer-driven marketplace, we will be required to develop or acquire new capabilities, attract new talent and develop new service and distribution relationships that respond to consumer needs and preferences.\nChanges in marketplace dynamics or the actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation, the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, and decisions to exclude us from new restricted retail pharmacy networks could materially and adversely affect our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or prospects.\nOur results of operations are subject to the risks and uncertainties of fluctuations in pharmaceutical prices, availability and safe profiles.\nOur revenue and gross profit are subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases. If the frequency or rate of pharmaceutical price increases slows, the results of our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our profitability is impacted by the utilization of prescription drugs. If utilization declines due to inflation in the price of drugs, particularly given the increased usage of high-deductible health insurance plans, our profitability could be adversely affected. Our gross profits are also subject to price deflation. If pharmaceutical price deflation occurs, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, increases in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, could have material adverse effects on the results of our operations. If we fail to offset such cost increases or modify our activities to reduce the impact, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our expectations could be materially different than, and any future change in drug prices could be significantly different from, our expectations.\nThe profitability of our pharmacy services is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products. Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may decline if physicians cease writing prescriptions for drugs or the utilization of drugs is reduced, including due to:\n\u2022increased safety risk profiles or regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022manufacturing or other supply issues;\n\u2022a reduction in drug manufacturers\u2019 participation in federal programs;\n\u2022certain products being withdrawn by their manufacturers or transitioned to over-the-counter products;\n\u2022future FDA rulings restricting the supply or increasing the cost of products;\n\u2022the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs or lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name products; or\n\u2022inflation in the price of drugs.\nIn addition, increased utilization of generic drugs has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments to pharmacies for generic drugs, causing a reduction in our margins on sales of generic drugs. Consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factors may enhance the ability of manufacturers to sustain or increase pricing of generic drugs and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition costs. Any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition costs or to modify our activities to lessen the financial impact of such increased costs could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results.\nLegal Risks\nWe could be subject to securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against public companies in connection with business combinations and merger transactions, alleging that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with such transactions. Following MYOS\u2019s and our announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement on June 30, 2020, MYOS received separate litigation demands from purported MYOS stockholders on September 16, 2020 and October 20, 2020, respectively seeking certain additional disclosures in the Form S-4 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 2, 2020, collectively, the Demands. Thereafter, on September 23, 2020, a complaint regarding the transactions contemplated within the Merger Agreement was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, captioned Faasse v. MYOS RENS Technology Inc., et. al., Index No.: 654644/2020 (NY Supreme Ct., NY Cnty., September 23, 2020), or the New York Complaint. On October 12, 2020, a second complaint regarding the transactions was filed in the District Court of Nevada, Clark County Nevada, captioned Vigil v. Mannello, et. al., Case No. A-20-822848-C, or the Nevada Complaint, and together with the New York Complaint, the Complaints, and collectively with the Demands, the Litigation.\nThe Demands and the Complaints that comprise the Litigation generally alleged that the directors of MYOS breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the Merger Agreement, and MYOS and we disseminated an incomplete and misleading Form S-4 Registration Statement. The New York Complaint also alleged we aided and abetted such breach of fiduciary duties.\nMYOS and we believe that the claims asserted in the Litigation are without merit, and believe that the Form S-4 Registration Statement disclosed all material information concerning the Merger and no supplemental disclosure is required under applicable law. However, in order to avoid the risk of the Litigation delaying or adversely affecting the Merger and to minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, MYOS determined to voluntarily supplement the Form S-4 Registration Statement as described in the Current Report on Form 8-K on November 2, 2020. Subsequently, the Nevada Complaint and the New York Complaint were voluntarily dismissed. The remainder of the Litigation remains outstanding. MYOS and we specifically deny all allegations in the Litigation and/or that any additional disclosure was or is required.\nThe outcome of the Litigation is uncertain. If the Litigation remains unresolved or we are required to defend or settle any Litigation, this could result in significant costs to us, including costs associated with the indemnification of our directors and officers, other damages or settlement amounts, and other significant defense costs. Such payments could adversely affect our operations. Other plaintiffs may also file lawsuits against us and/or our directors and officers in connection with the Merger, resulting in substantial costs to us and requiring us and our directors and officers to defend against multiple lawsuits potentially filed in different jurisdictions and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. This could adversely affect the operation of our business or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain liability insurance; however, if any costs or expenses associated with the Litigation or any other litigation exceed our insurance coverage, and we may be forced to bear some or all of these costs and expenses directly, which could be substantial.\nWe are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We may become involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities.\nLegal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.\nLike other companies in the retail pharmacy, we are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which it may operate. There continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities of, and increased litigation regarding, our and the rest of the health care and related industry\u2019s business, compliance and reporting practices. As a result, we are regularly the subject of government actions of the types described above. In addition, under the qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of \u201cfalse\u201d claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party\u2019s claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of any legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, we may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, many of which are highly complex, we could be subject to significant adverse regulatory actions or suffer brand and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by state, federal and international governmental authorities. See \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation.\u201d The laws and regulations governing our operations and interpretations of those laws and regulations are increasing in number and complexity, change frequently and can be inconsistent or conflict with one another. In general, these laws and regulations are designed to benefit and protect customers, members and providers rather than us or our investors. In addition, the governmental authorities that regulate our businesses have broad latitude to make, interpret and enforce the laws and regulations that govern us and continue to interpret and enforce those laws and regulations more strictly and more aggressively each year. We also must follow various restrictions on certain of our businesses and the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries put in place by certain state regulators.\nIn addition, during the past several years, the United States health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state levels. Further, uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business. In addition, it is possible that certain provisions of the current health care reform legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated. Changes in these laws and regulations and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including, but not limited to: imposition of civil or criminal penalties; significant fines or monetary penalties; suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications or approvals; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; or loss of registrations or licensure. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: the laws and regulations described in the Government Regulation section; accounting standards; financial disclosure; securities laws and regulations; federal anti-trust laws; tax laws and regulations and their possible reform; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous materials and wastes; and laws and regulations of the FTC, the FCC, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products that we sell, such as Boards of Pharmacy. The FDA, DEA and various states regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA, if we distribute controlled substances in the future, and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various states\u2019 controlled substances acts and their accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our registrations and licenses, seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, our business interests outside of the United States are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. We are also subject to the terms of various government agreements and mandates, including those described in the Government Regulation section. In that regard, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected by existing and new government legislative, regulatory action and enforcement activity, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following:\n\u2022the clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs and other health care products and services, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors, and our failure to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to the dispensing of drugs could subject us to civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern our relationship with drug manufacturers, customers and consumers;\n\u2022federal and state laws and regulations concerning the submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs;\n\u2022federal and state laws and regulations governing the purchase, distribution, tracking, management, compounding, dispensing and reimbursement of prescription drugs and related services, and applicable registration or licensing requirements;\n\u2022heightened enforcement of controlled substances regulations, if applicable;\n\u2022rules and regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA and the HITECH Act; and other federal and state laws affecting the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of health or other personal information, such as federal laws on information privacy precipitated by concerns about information collection through the Internet, state security breach laws and state laws limiting the use and disclosure of prescriber information;\n\u2022health care fraud and abuse laws regulations;\n\u2022consumer protection laws affecting our health care services, our loyalty programs, our drug discount card programs, the products we sell, the informational calls we make and/or the marketing of our goods and services;\n\u2022federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, including the management of hazardous substances, storage and transportation of hazardous materials, and various recordkeeping disclosure and procedure requirements promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that may apply to our operations;\n\u2022health care reform, managed care reform and plan design legislation;\n\u2022laws against the corporate practice of medicine;\n\u2022FDA regulation affecting the pharmacy industry;\n\u2022government regulation of the development, administration, review and updating of formularies and drug lists including requirements and/or limitations around formulary tiering and patient cost sharing;\n\u2022state laws and regulations related to increased oversight of pharmacy activities, including laws related to reimbursement for generics and pharmacy audits;\n\u2022drug pricing legislation, including \u201cmost favored nation\u201d pricing;\n\u2022federal and state laws and regulations establishing or changing prompt payment requirements for payments to retail pharmacies;\n\u2022impact of network access legislation or regulations, including \u201cany willing provider\u201d laws, on our ability to manage pharmacy networks;\n\u2022ERISA and related regulations;\n\u2022administration of Medicare Part D, including legislative changes and/or CMS rulemaking and interpretation;\n\u2022Medicare and Medicaid regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022insurance licensing and other insurance regulatory requirements applicable to offering Medicare Part D programs and services or other health care services; and\n\u2022direct regulation of pharmacies or PBMs by regulatory and quasi-regulatory bodies.\nThe scope of the practices and activities that are prohibited by federal and state false claims acts is uncertain and may be the subject of pending or future litigation. Claims under federal and state false claims acts can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suit. If we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a government program or if there is an adverse decision against it under the federal False Claims Act, it may be temporarily or permanently suspended from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs, and we also may be required to pay significant fines and/or other monetary penalties. Whistleblower suits have resulted in significant settlements between governmental agencies and health care companies. The significant incentives and protections provided to whistleblowers under applicable law increase the risk of whistleblower suits.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations that apply to government programs, we could be subject to criminal fines, civil penalties, premium refunds, prohibitions on marketing or active or passive enrollment of members, corrective actions, termination of our contracts or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, dual eligible, dual eligible special needs plan and other programs and on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur businesses, profitability and growth also may be adversely affected by (i) judicial and regulatory decisions that change and/or expand the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations, impose medical or bad faith liability, or (ii) other legislation and regulations.\nPharmacies and pharmacists must obtain federal and state licenses to operate, distribute and dispense pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. If we are unable to obtain and maintain our licenses, meet certain security and operating standards or comply with acts and regulations covering among other things, the sale, distribution and dispensing of controlled substances, or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on non-resident pharmacies, this could limit or affect our ability to operate in some states. In addition, each state has different laws passed by state legislatures and rules approved by state pharmacy boards governing the operation, distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and there is no universal federal or international regulation. This lack of uniform laws and rules makes the costs of compliance significant and makes a violation of state laws and rules by us more likely. Furthermore, the laws and rules relating to pharmacy technology are relatively new and evolving further adding to the cost of compliance and increasing our risk of noncompliance. Federal and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, and are able to revoke licenses, seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative fines and sanctions for violations of such laws and regulations, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nChanges in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payors in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.\nIn the United States, electoral results and changes in political leadership have generated uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries. There have been multiple attempts to repeal, modify or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of the ACA, which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. The ACA and related healthcare reform laws, regulations and initiatives have significantly increased regulation of managed care plans and decreased reimbursement to Medicare managed care. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify these laws and/or adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results. Future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the ACA or otherwise could adversely impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage, increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative, rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to drug pricing, to reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference to pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices, which may adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.\nMoreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In 2020, under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and CMS issued various rules in November and December of 2020 that were expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug\nRebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the HHS challenging various aspects of the rules implemented during the Trump administration. As a result, the Biden administration and HHS have delayed the implementation or published rules rescinding some of these Trump-era policies. Congress is considering legislation that, if passed, could have significant impact on prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including limitations on drug price increases and allowing Medicare to negotiate pricing for certain covered drug products. The impact of these regulations and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is currently unknown. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue or attain profitability. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Depending on the details of further executive, legislative and administrative actions, these measures as well as other proposals could have significant impacts for drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and providers, which may significantly and adversely affect the business of our customers as well as our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability.\nWe cannot predict the enactment or content of new legislation or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or their enforcement, interpretation or application, or the effect they will have on our business operations or operating results. Examples of such changes include: the federal or one or more state governments fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible or dual eligible special needs plan programs, increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing, purchasing and/or importation, changing the laws and regulations governing pharmacy benefit managers, prescription drug plans and/or managed care organizations\u2019 interactions with government funded health care programs, changing the tax treatment of health or related benefits, or significantly altering the ACA. The likelihood of adverse changes remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressures, and our businesses and operating results could be materially and adversely affected by such changes, even if we correctly predict their occurrence.\nWe are subject to governmental audits and reviews that could result in changes to our business practices and material refunds, fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities and other sanctions.\nWe are subject to governmental audits and reviews by various federal and state agencies, regulatory authorities, attorneys general, and other state, federal and international governmental authorities. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to us and other industry participants are complex and subject to change, making it necessary for us to invest significant resources to comply with our regulatory and contractual requirements. Ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical regulatory scheme mean that our compliance efforts in this area will continue to require significant resources. If we are not in compliance with applicable laws, governmental audits, investigations and reviews by federal, state and international regulators could result in changes to our business practices, and also could result in significant or material premium refunds, fines, penalties, civil liabilities, criminal liabilities or other sanctions, including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs and suspension or loss of licensure. Any of these audits, investigations or reviews could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition or result in significant liabilities and negative publicity for us.\nExpansion of our businesses in government-funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, exposes us to additional risks and challenges.\nAs our government funded businesses grow, our exposure to changes in federal and state government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the various government funded programs in which we participate also increases. The laws and regulations governing participation in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, and managed Medicaid plans are complex, are subject to interpretation and can expose us to penalties for non-compliance. Federal, state and local governments have the right to cancel or not to renew their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available. Funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issues and priorities.\nFor example, in January 2021, CMS issued its final notice detailing final 2022 Medicare Advantage benchmark payment rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rates of approximately 4.1%. We cannot predict future Medicare funding levels, the impact of future federal budget actions or ensure that such changes or actions will not have an adverse effect on our Medicare operating results. The expansion of our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D service area is subject to the ability of CMS to process our requests for service area expansions and our ability to build cost competitive provider networks in the expanded service areas that meet applicable network adequacy requirements. CMS\u2019s decisions on our requests for service area expansions may be affected adversely by any compliance issues that we may experience in our Medicare operations.\nCMS regularly audits performance of service providers or suppliers that contract with CMS to determine compliance with CMS\u2019s regulations and contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of the services provided to Medicare members. As a result of these audits, we may be subject to significant or material fines, criminal liability, civil monetary penalties, CMS imposed sanctions (including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs) or other restrictions on our Medicare, Medicaid and other businesses, including suspension or loss of licensure.\nMedicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures. Our Medicare Part D operating results and our ability to expand our Medicare Part D business could be adversely affected if: the cost and complexity of Medicare Part D exceed management\u2019s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; changes to the applicable regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; the government alters Medicare Part D program requirements or reduces funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; the government mandated use of point-of-sale manufacturer\u2019s rebates effective in 2022 continues; the government enacts price controls on certain pharmaceutical products in Medicare Part D; or the government makes changes to how pharmacy pay-for-performance is calculated.\nIf we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a CMS audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, civil monetary penalties or other sanctions, including fines and penalties under the False Claims Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D or other government programs, and on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe U.S. federal government and our other government customers also may reduce funding for health care or other programs, cancel or decline to renew contracts with us, or make changes that adversely affect the number of persons eligible for certain programs, the services provided to enrollees in such programs, our premiums and our administrative and health care and other benefit costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and cash flows. When federal funding is delayed, suspended or curtailed, we continue to receive, and we remain liable for and are required to fund, claims from providers for providing services to beneficiaries of federally funded health benefits programs in which we participate. An extended federal government shutdown or a delay by Congress in raising the federal government\u2019s debt ceiling also could lead to a delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and a significant increase in interest rates that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, our ability to access the capital markets and our businesses, operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nPossible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our business.\nIt is possible that the pharmaceutical industry, regulators, or federal policymakers may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference used for pharmacy services, drug purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of Actual Acquisition Cost. It is also possible that Congress may enact some form of price negotiation for Medicare. In addition, CMS also publishes the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (\u201cNADAC\u201d) for certain drugs; NADAC pricing is being adopted in an increasing number of states. Future changes to the use of various published pricing benchmarks used to establish drug pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health care programs and/or other payors, could impact the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payors, and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with drug manufacturers, wholesalers or other distributors. A failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact of such increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections. We cannot predict the effect of these possible changes on our businesses.\nWe must comply with a variety of existing and future laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs on us and may adversely affect our business.\nThe scope of foreign investments in U.S. businesses was recently expanded by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, or FIRRMA, to include certain non-passive, non-controlling investments (including certain investments in entities that hold or process personal information about U.S. nationals) and transactions structured or intended to evade or circumvent the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, and any transaction resulting in a \u201cchange in the rights\u201d of a foreign person in a U.S. business if that change could result in either control of the business or a covered non-controlling investment.\nCFIUS could intervene in our previously completed fundraising rounds and require us to modify or amend the terms of those transactions, or terminate or unwind all or part of the transactions, if CFIUS determines that it is necessary to address U.S. national security concerns, without regard to whether the transaction was completed and operated in accordance with applicable law.\nIf relations between China and the U.S. or between Russia and the U.S. deteriorate, we may be materially and adversely affected.\nDoing business internationally, such as any international supply chains that we or our suppliers or manufacturers may utilize or depend on, or sources of current or future capital, or those of our employees who are based in Canada, creates financial risks for our business. International operations entail a variety of other risks, including restrictions on foreign investors in us, enhanced oversight by CFIUS, and substantial restrictions on, and scrutiny of, foreign investment - especially Russian and Chinese investment. The relationship between the U.S. and certain other countries, including Russia and China, is subject to periodic tension, and now especially heightened concern in light of Russian\u2019s significant military actions against Ukraine. Relations may also be compromised or become more strained if the U.S pressures the PRC government regarding its monetary, economic, or social policies or if the U.S. continues to institute or increase sanctions against Russia due to ongoing conflict between Russian and Ukraine. Changes in political conditions, particularly in Russia or China, and changes in the state of China-U.S. or Russia-U.S. relations are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations or financial condition. Furthermore, CFIUS has continued to apply a more stringent review of certain foreign investment in U.S. companies, including investment by Chinese entities. We cannot predict what effect any changes in China-U.S. relations or Russia-U.S. relations may have on our ability to access capital or effectively support ourself.\nThe impact of the military action in Ukraine has affected and may continue to affect our business.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is possible. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia and Ukraine, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country\u2019s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Any such material adverse effect from the conflict and enhanced sanctions activity may disrupt our supply chains and affect the delivery of our products and services, or impair our ability to complete financial or banking transactions.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Manufacturers, Providers, Suppliers and Vendors\nBoth our and our vendors\u2019 operations are subject to a variety of business continuity hazards and risks, any of which could interrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our performance and operating results.\nWe and our vendors are subject to business continuity hazards and other risks, including natural disasters, utility and other mechanical failures, acts of war or terrorism, disruption of communications, data security and preservation, disruption of supply or distribution, safety regulation and labor difficulties. The occurrence of any of these or other events to us or our vendors might disrupt or shut down out operations or otherwise adversely affect our operations. We also may be subject to certain liability claims in the event of an injury or loss of life, or damage to property, resulting from such events. Although we have developed procedures for crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plans and maintain insurance policies that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and industry, our insurance policies include limits and exclusions and, as a result, our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazards and risks incident to our businesses. In addition, our crisis management and disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans may not be effective. Should any such hazards or risks occur, or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable, our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nInterruptions or delays in shipments could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.\nWe have been and could continue to be subject to manufacturing disruptions and supply chain delays, such as the recent blockade of a U.S. and Canada border crossing over COVID-19 measures, the current ongoing semiconductor chip shortage, or as a result of Russia\u2019s significant military actions against Ukraine. Such disruptions or delays place significant pressure on our supply chain management, manufacturing, inventory and quality control management, to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing, manufacturing capacity, inventory and quality compliance and logistics. A significant interruption in these critical functions could result in delayed kiosk deployment or resupply, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our MedCenter Kiosks to a third party.\nWe rely on a single third party manufacturer to make our MedCenter Kiosks. Our former manufacturer is no longer manufacturing the MedCenter Kiosks for us and we signed a new manufacturing and supply agreement with Kitron Technologies. There are risks associated with Kitron Technologies\u2019s ability to qualify and ramp a new manufacturing line. As a result, additional MedCenter Kiosks may be delayed or stalled pending the qualification and ramping up of the new manufacturing line.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we will suffer substantial harm.\nOur success depends upon the protection of our software and hardware designs and other proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality provisions in agreements with employees, contract manufacturers, consultants, customers and other third parties, to protect our intellectual property rights. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. In addition, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed. For example, if a competitor were to gain use of certain of our proprietary technology, they might be able to develop and manufacture similarly designed MedCenter Kiosks at a reduced cost, which would result in a decrease in demand for our products. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents are issued, they may be contested, circumvented or invalidated over the course of our business. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar to or superior to our technologies. If that happens, we may need to license these technologies and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, thereby causing great harm to our business. In addition, if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could become burdensome and expensive, even if we were to prevail.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could cause us to suffer substantial harm.\nMany companies have significant patent portfolios and these companies and other parties may claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. Any party asserting that our products infringe their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves, and possibly our customers, against the alleged infringement. These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights. Such may also force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022stop selling, incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022redesign those products that use any allegedly infringing technology, which may be costly and time-consuming; or\n\u2022refund deposits and other amounts received for allegedly infringing technology or products.\nAny claim of infringement from a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims, and could distract our management from running our business. Even if we prevail, the cost of such litigation could deplete our financial resources. Litigation is also time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business. Furthermore, during the course of litigation, confidential information may be disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests, depositions or trial testimony. Disclosure of our confidential information and our involvement in intellectual property litigation could materially and adversely affect our business. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could significantly limit our ability to continue our operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nWe will need to raise additional financing in the future to fund our operations, which may not be available to it on favorable terms or at all.\nWe will require substantial additional funds to continue to expand the core business, develop and commercialize our self-service pharmacy. The amount of our future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including the: cost to manufacture additional MedCenter kiosks, development of pharmacy self-service capabilities, expenses related to initiating operations in a new state or region, cost to hire pharmacy and corporate support staff, expenses related to leasing additional real estate space for pharmacy operations and or corporate services, cost of information technology infrastructure needed to support growth across new geographical markets, expenses for licensing technologies and other required legal, audit or outside services. Raising additional capital may be costly or difficult to obtain and could significantly dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership interests or inhibit our ability to achieve our business objectives. The terms of any securities issued in public or private financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders, including liquidated damages in the event we are unable to register shares in a private placement or unable to maintain registration for such\nshares. Further, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest in us will be diluted. In addition, any debt financing may subject us to fixed payment obligations and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable intellectual property or other rights to our products, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Even if we were to obtain sufficient funding, there can be no assurance that we will be available on terms acceptable to us or our stockholders. We have experienced recurring net losses from operations, negative cash flows from operating activities, and a significant accumulated deficit and expect to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. As a result, our financial statements include explanatory disclosures expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe market price of our Common Stock is expected to be volatile, and the market price of the common stock may drop.\nThe market price of our Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Our common stock traded between $17.15 and $1.25 per share during the year ended December 31, 2021. Market prices for securities of early-stage telehealth, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022our ability to obtain state board of pharmacy licenses and regulatory approvals, and delays or failures to obtain and maintain such licenses approvals;\n\u2022failure of any of our products to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022the impact of the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and its impact on the global and domestic economy;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any other future pandemics on our business;\n\u2022our failure to maintain our existing third-party license and supply agreements;\n\u2022failure by us or our licensors to prosecute, maintain, or enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to us;\n\u2022any inability to obtain adequate supply of our products or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022adverse regulatory authority decisions;\n\u2022introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022failure to meet or exceed financial and development projections we may provide to the public and the investment community;\n\u2022the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022general market or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022announcements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022adverse publicity generally, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets;\n\u2022the introduction of technological innovations that compete with our potential products;\n\u2022changes in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u2022period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022investors\u2019 reactions to the prospects of our business; or\n\u2022changes in analysts\u2019 estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 estimates.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements, the minimum closing bid price requirement, or the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, impair our ability to raise additional funds, and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nWe will incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nWe will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We will also incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as applicable securities laws and rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations are expected to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, some members of our management team have not previously managed and operated a public company. These executive officers and other personnel will need to devote substantial time to gaining expertise regarding operations as a public company and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These rules and regulations also may make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board of directors or impede a takeover.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by the board of directors, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.\nWhile these provisions will not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the board of directors, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.\nThere are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results.\nMany other factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including:\n\u2022our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs;\n\u2022inflation, new or increased taxes, changes in market conditions or otherwise;\n\u2022natural disasters, civil unrest, severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events;\n\u2022liabilities or expense relating to the protection of the environment, related health and safety matters, environmental remediation or compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances;\n\u2022the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmacy industry in particular, along with changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery;\n\u2022adverse publicity and potential losses, liabilities and reputational harm stemming from any public incident, whether occurring online, in social media, in our stores or our other facilities, or elsewhere, involving us, our personnel or our brands, including any such public incident involving our customers, products, services, stores or other property, or those of any of our vendors or other parties with which we do business;\n\u2022negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to safety or quality, human and workplace rights, or other issues damaging our brand image and corporate reputation, or that of any of our vendors or strategic allies; and\n\u2022technological innovation that changes delivery of healthcare resulting new modes of medication distribution.\nThe terms of our credit agreement require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.\nWe entered into a senior secured term loan facility with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, on June 7, 2021, or the Loan Agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $10.0 million in aggregate initial term loans, or the Initial Loans. We may borrow up to an additional $20.0 million in aggregate term loans (or, together with the Initial Loans, the Loans) on or before April 30, 2022, subject to no material adverse change or event of default (each as defined in the Loan Agreement) having occurred and continuing. The Loans are secured by substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions. The Loan Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants, and the terms may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry, or take future actions.\nThe Loan Agreement includes customary representations and covenants that, subject to exceptions and qualifications, restrict our ability to do the following things: engage in mergers, acquisitions, and asset sales; transact with affiliates; undergo a change in control; engage in businesses that are not related to our existing business; add or change business locations; incur additional indebtedness; incur additional liens; make loans and investments; declare dividends or redeem or repurchase equity interests; and make certain amendments or payments in respect of any subordinated debt. In addition, the Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, maintenance of our bank accounts, protection of our intellectual property, reporting requirements, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and formation or acquisition of new subsidiaries. The Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default. If we fail to comply with such covenants, payments or other terms of the Loan Agreement, our lender could declare an event of default, which would give it the right to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, our lender would have the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the Loan Agreement. If the debt under the Loan Agreement was accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient assets to repay this debt, which would harm our business and financial condition.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe expect to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock is expected to be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of the Loan Agreement restrict our ability to pay dividends to limited circumstances. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nAn active trading market for our Common Stock may not develop and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of Common Stock for a profit, if at all.\nPrior to our reverse merger with MYOS, there had been no public market for MedAvail\u2019s common stock. An active trading market for our shares of Common Stock may never develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at an attractive price or at all.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after legal restrictions on resale, the trading price of our common stock could decline. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the event we do have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases covering us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq and the SEC. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a private company, MedAvail has never been required to test our internal controls within a specified period or for an extended period of time. This will require that we incur substantial professional fees and internal costs to expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts. We may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner.\nWe may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nIf we fail to attract and retain management and other key personnel, we may be unable to continue to successfully develop or commercialize our products or otherwise implement our business plan.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive healthcare industry depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, pharmacy technology, legal, sales and marketing and other personnel. We will be highly dependent on our management and pharmacy personnel. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could impede, delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline or acquisition of new assets and could negatively impact our ability to successfully implement our business plan. If we lose the services of any of these individuals, we might not be able to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or at all, and our business could be harmed as a result. We might not be able to attract or retain qualified management and other key personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among telehealth, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses competing for talent.\nWe have undergone recent changes to our senior management team and if we are unable to integrate new members of our senior management team, or if we lose the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn January, 2022, as part of a succession plan, Ed Kilroy, our Chief Executive Officer resigned and the Board of Directors appointed Mark Doerr as our Chief Executive Officer. In June 2021, our former Chief Financial Officer resigned and Ramona Seabaugh was appointed our new Chief Financial Officer in September 2021. In addition, over the last twelve months, we have had several senior management changes including the hiring of Steven Hess as our Executive Vice President, General Manager, of SpotRx, and the resignation of our Chief Pharmacy Officer in September 2021. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure the timely and suitable replacement and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. In particular, this or any future leadership transition may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives, and has the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity and increased turnover. We must successfully integrate our new leadership team members within our organization to achieve our operating objectives.\nOur future success depends in large part on the continued service of senior management and other key personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of our senior management team, many of whom are critical to the development of our technology, platform, future vision, and strategic direction. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of operations, security, marketing, sales, support, and general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors on our research and development team. Our senior management and other key personnel are all employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time, for any reason and without notice. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. If we lose the services of senior management or other key personnel, or if our senior management team cannot work together effectively, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to us will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements, such as simplified executive compensation disclosures and reduced financial statement disclosure requirements in our SEC filings. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of the reporting exemptions applicable to a smaller reporting company until we are no longer a smaller reporting company, which status would end once we have a public float greater than $250 million. In that event, however, we could still be a smaller reporting company if our annual revenues were below $100 million and we have a public float of less than $700 million.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Related Risk Factors.\nCOVID-19 has and may continue to delay our deployment of MedCenters into third-party owned Medicare-focused healthcare clinics. COVID-19 can limit our access to the clinics where the SpotRx pharmacy is deployed and significantly impair our ability to acquire new customers. In addition, COVID-19 has impacted and will continue to impact our revenue growth. The potential impact of COVID-19 includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\u2022fewer patients see their physicians and seek medical attention at clinics;\n\u2022some clinics have been closed and staffing at other clinics has been reduced affecting their ability to service their customers;\n\u2022we are dependent on our supply chain for purchasing medication. If demand spikes for certain medications it can impact our ability to acquire and resell the medication to serve our customers;\n\u2022we are dependent on a single contract manufacture, who assemble our MedCenter kiosks. Any disruption of their supply capability due to COVID-19 would impact our ability to deploy new sites as well as sell our solution to other new clients;\n\u2022we outsource the majority of our hardware maintenance to third parties who repair MedCenters with technical issues as well as install new MedCenters as required. Any disruption to their ability to supply services to us will impact both currently operating MedCenters as well as slow down deployment of new sites; and\n\u2022the focus of the healthcare system is on treating COVID-19 and as a result resources are concentrated there as opposed to on other matter.\nThe existence and persistence of COVID-19 and other pandemics may negatively impact our revenue and growth and may adversely affect the results of our operations in the future.", "PERMNO": 14820, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MYOS"}
