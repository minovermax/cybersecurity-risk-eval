RISK FACTORS\nWorldwide economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur business is influenced by conditions in domestic and foreign economies, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability and cost of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Volatility in financial markets and the continued softness or further deterioration of national and global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, including as follows:\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers;\n\u2022\ncommercial and residential consumers of our products may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or stagnation or further declines in income or asset values, which could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our product;\n\u2022\nthe net asset value of the investment funds underlying our defined benefit pension plans may decline, which could result in negative plan investment performance and additional charges which may involve significant cash contributions to such plans, to meet obligations or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nour asset impairment assessments and underlying valuation assumptions may change, which could result from changes to estimates of future sales and cash flows that may lead to substantial impairment charges.\nContinued or sustained deterioration of economic conditions would likely exacerbate and prolong these adverse effects.\nOur business is dependent on construction activity. Downturns in construction activity could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur businesses have greater sales opportunities when construction activity is strong and, conversely, have fewer opportunities when such activity declines. The cyclical nature of commercial and residential construction activity, including construction activity funded by the public sector, tends to be influenced by prevailing economic conditions, including the rate of growth in gross domestic product, prevailing interest rates, government spending patterns, business, investor and consumer confidence and other factors beyond our control. Prolonged downturns in construction activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur plan to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.\nOn February 19, 2015, our board of directors approved a plan to separate our flooring business from our ceilings (building products) business through a spinoff, which would result in two independent, publicly-traded companies. Completion of the separation will be contingent upon customary closing conditions, including, among other things, authorization and approval of our board of directors of the final terms of the separation, receipt of a legal opinion regarding the tax-free status of the spinoff, execution of intercompany agreements, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10 with the SEC, and market and certain other conditions. For these and other reasons, the separation may not be completed during the first quarter of 2016, as currently anticipated, if at all.\nEven if the separation is not completed, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nexecution of the separation will require significant time and attention from management, which may distract management from the operation of our businesses and the execution of other initiatives that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022\nwe may experience unanticipated competitive developments, including changes in the conditions of our flooring and ceilings business\u2019s respective markets;\n\u2022\nwe may experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay certain costs and expenses relating to the spinoff, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees, and may be required to pay certain non-U.S. tax costs resulting from internal restructurings whether or not the spinoff is completed; and\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the spinoff.\nAny of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nThe separation may not be beneficial.\nWe may not realize strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the separation. As independent publicly-traded companies, the Company and Armstrong Flooring, Inc. will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect their respective business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the separation not occurred.\nThe separation may result in disruptions to, and negatively impact our relationships with, our customers and other business partners and the relationships with the customers and other business partners of Armstrong Flooring, Inc.\nUncertainty related to the separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or with which we and Armstrong Flooring, Inc. may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or Armstrong Flooring. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our or Armstrong Floorings\u2019 businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the separation.\nThe separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe spinoff is conditioned on our receipt of an opinion of special tax counsel to us, in form and substance satisfactory to us, that the distribution of shares of our flooring business in the spinoff will qualify as tax-free to the flooring business, us and our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 and certain other related provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and that certain internal restructuring transactions in connection with the spinoff similarly will be tax-free to the flooring business, us and other members of our consolidated tax reporting group. The opinion will rely on, among other things, various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by us and the flooring business which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, could jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. The opinion will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts will not challenge the qualification of the spinoff as a transaction under Section 355 or other provisions of the Code or the qualifications of the internal restructuring transactions as tax-free or that any such challenge would not prevail. In addition, we may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation, including non-U.S. tax expense resulting from separations in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material.\nIf the spinoff were determined not to qualify under Section 355 of the Code, each U.S. holder of our common shares who receives shares of the flooring business in connection with the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the\nshares of the flooring business that are received. That distribution would be taxable to each such shareholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. For each such shareholder, any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder\u2019s tax basis in his or her common shares of the Company with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. We would be subject to tax as if we had sold common shares in a taxable sale for their fair market value and we would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of such common shares over our tax basis in such common shares, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur markets are highly competitive. Competition can reduce demand for our products or cause us to lower prices. Failure to compete effectively by meeting consumer preferences and maintaining market share could adversely affect our results.\nOur markets are highly competitive. Competition can reduce demand for our products, negatively affect our product sales mix or cause us to lower prices. Failure to compete effectively by meeting consumer preferences and maintaining market share could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Our customers consider our products\u2019 performance, product styling, customer service and price when deciding whether to purchase our products. Shifting consumer preference in our highly competitive markets, from residential vinyl products to other flooring products, for example, whether for performance or styling preferences or our inability to develop and offer new competitive performance features could have an adverse effect on our sales. In addition, excess industry capacity for certain products in several geographic markets could lead to industry consolidation and/or increased price competition. We are also subject to potential increased price competition from overseas competitors which may have lower cost structures.\nSales fluctuations to and changes in our relationships with key customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nSome of our business lines and markets are dependent on a few key customers, including independent distributors. The loss, reduction, or fluctuation of sales to one of these major customers, or any adverse change in our business relationship with any one of them, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIf the availability of raw materials or energy decreases, or the costs increase, and we are unable to pass along increased costs, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe availability and cost of raw materials, packaging materials, energy and sourced products are critical to our operations. For example, we use substantial quantities of natural gas, petroleum-based raw materials and hardwood lumber in our manufacturing operations. The cost of some of these items has been volatile in recent years and availability has been limited at times. We source some materials from a limited number of suppliers, which, among other things, increases the risk of unavailability. Limited availability could cause us to reformulate products or limit our production. Decreased access to raw materials and energy or significant increased cost to purchase these items and any corresponding inability to pass along such costs through price increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness include covenants that, among other things, may impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests. These covenants may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets to secure debt.\nUnder the terms of our senior secured credit facility, we are required to maintain specified leverage and interest coverage ratios. Our ability to meet these ratios could be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will meet them. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants or ratios would result in a default under the senior secured credit facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facility may be able to elect to declare all outstanding borrowings under our facilities, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, or enforce their security interest. The lenders may also have the right in these circumstances to terminate commitments to provide further borrowings.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, make payments on our indebtedness and declare dividends on our capital stock.\nOur level of indebtedness and degree of leverage could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, more able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our credit ratings.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness, which could exacerbate the risks described above. In addition, to the extent that our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates, our sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations will increase.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe require a significant amount of liquidity to fund our operations, and borrowing has increased our vulnerability to negative unforeseen events.\nOur liquidity needs vary throughout the year. If our business experiences materially negative unforeseen events, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our needs or maintain sufficient liquidity to operate and remain in compliance with our debt covenants, which could result in reduced or delayed planned capital expenditures and other investments and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur decision to exit our European flooring business could result in potential claims and liabilities arising from the insolvency proceedings initiated by our former management in Germany.\nOn December 4, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the cessation of funding to our DLW subsidiary, which formerly was our European flooring business. As a result of the decision, DLW management concluded that its operations could not be financed and sustained without funding from us and filed for\ninsolvency in Germany on December 11, 2014. On the same date, the German insolvency court appointed an administrator (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d) to oversee DLW\u2019s operations. We expect to enter supply and transition services agreements with the Administrator, pursuant to which we may agree to continue to purchase linoleum and homogenous flooring products from DLW for sale in the Americas and the Pacific Rim, and continue to provide administrative support services to DLW for information technology and accounts receivables and payables for a limited transition period. The insolvency proceedings are currently expected to continue through 2015, if not longer, during which time it may be unclear whether and to what extent we may be subject to potential claims and liabilities, including claw-backs, arising from the proceedings. Similarly, pending the conclusion of the insolvency proceedings, it may be unclear to what extent and for how long we may be required to continue to provide support services to DLW, and whether the prices we pay for purchases of DLW products could increase. Any significant judgment or claim, prolonged provision of support services to DLW, or increased costs associated with our purchase of DLW products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nOur WAVE joint venture is important to our financial results, and if there is a change with respect to our partner that adversely impacts its relationship with us, WAVE\u2019s performance could be adversely impacted.\nOur equity investment in our WAVE joint venture remains important to our financial results. We believe an important element in the success of this joint venture is the relationship with our partner, Worthington Industries, Inc. If there is a change in ownership, a change of control, a change in management or management philosophy, a change in business strategy or another event with respect to our partner that adversely impacts our relationship, WAVE\u2019s performance could be adversely impacted. In addition, our partner may have economic or business interests or goals that are different from or inconsistent with our interests or goals, which may impact our ability to influence or align WAVE\u2019s strategy and operations.\nWe may be subject to liability under and may make substantial future expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities for which our ultimate liability may exceed the currently estimated and accrued amounts. It is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental matters and corresponding liabilities in the future. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our environmental matters.\nThe building materials industry has been subject to claims relating to raw materials such as silicates, PCBs, PVC, formaldehyde, fire-retardants and claims relating to other issues such as mold and toxic fumes, as well as claims for incidents of catastrophic loss, such as building fires. We have not received any significant claims involving our raw materials or our product performance; however, product liability insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances to cover claims that may arise in the future.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future, and these increased costs may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations in both established and emerging markets. Legislative, political, regulatory and economic volatility, as well as vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our products move in international trade, with approximately 25% of our revenues from operations outside the United States and Canada in 2014. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our international trade is subject to currency exchange fluctuations, trade regulations, import duties, logistics costs, delays and other related risks. Our international operations are also subject to various tax rates, credit risks in emerging markets, political risks, uncertain legal systems, high costs in repatriating profits to the United States from some countries, and loss of sales to local competitors following currency devaluations in countries where we import products for sale. In addition, our international growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in certain emerging markets. However, some emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets.\nIn addition, in many countries outside of the United States, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar local anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with these laws, as well as U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties. As we continue to expand our business globally, including in emerging markets, we may have difficulty anticipating and effectively managing these and other risks that our international operations may face, which may adversely affect our business outside the United States and our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe may pursue strategic transactions that could create risks and present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, potential strategic transactions as opportunities arise. We routinely engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential transactions, including joint ventures, which could be significant. Any such strategic transaction involves a number of risks, including potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and business operations and infrastructure, and increasing or decreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. Strategic transactions could involve payment by us of a substantial amount of cash, assumption of liabilities and indemnification obligations, regulatory requirements, incurrence of a substantial amount of debt or issuance of a substantial amount of equity. Certain strategic opportunities may not result in the consummation of a transaction or may fail to realize the intended benefits and synergies. If we fail to consummate and integrate our strategic transactions in a timely and cost-effective manner, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operation could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur plant construction projects may adversely impact our results.\nWe recently completed several large plant construction projects, including two resilient flooring plants and one mineral fiber ceilings plant in China and, in the first quarter of 2015, a mineral fiber ceilings plant in Russia. In addition, we are adding manufacturing capability to our Lancaster, PA flooring plant to manufacture luxury vinyl tile (\u201cLVT\u201d) in North America. Economic and competitive advantages and returns expected from these projects may not fully materialize as a result of changes in market conditions. In addition, there can be no assurance that the actual cost of our LVT project in North America will not exceed our projections, and we may experience delays in this project for many reasons, including unavailability of materials, labor or equipment, regulatory matters or inclement weather.\nOur ability to utilize our deferred tax assets may be limited and our financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we determine our deferred tax assets are not realizable.\nWe have substantial deferred tax assets related to United States domestic foreign tax credits, or FTCs, and state net operating losses, or NOLs, which are available to reduce our U.S. income tax liability and to offset future state taxable income. However, our ability to utilize the current carrying value of these deferred tax assets may be impacted as a result of certain future events, such as changes in tax legislation, insufficient future taxable income prior to expiration of the FTCs and NOLs, or annual limits imposed under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, (\u201cSection 382\u201d), or by state law, as a result of an \u201cownership change.\u201d The Internal Revenue Code and some states impose limitations on a corporation\u2019s ability to utilize tax attributes, including NOLs and FTCs if it experiences an ownership change. An ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period.\nTogether the Armstrong World Industries, Inc. Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust (\u201cAsbestos PI Trust\u201d) and a former large shareholder, TPG Capital, collectively sold 5,980,000 shares, 12,057,382 shares, 6,000,000 shares, and 3,900,000 shares of our common shares during the fourth quarter of 2012, the third quarter of 2013, the fourth quarter of 2013, and the first quarter of 2014, respectively. Those sales\nsignificantly increase the likelihood that future sales by Asbestos PI Trust will cause an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382. At this time, we estimate that an additional sale of our common shares by Asbestos PI Trust prior to December 2015 would be reasonably likely to cause an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382. An \u201cownership change\u201d may result in limitations on the utilization of certain tax attributes, primarily our ability to deduct state NOLs against future state taxable income. If such \u201cownership change\u201d were to occur, we would be required to record a one-time, non-cash charge in our income statement in the period in which such \u201cownership change\u201d occurs. We currently estimate that, if such \u201cownership change\u201d had occurred on and as of the date hereof, based on the factors discussed below, the one-time charge that would have to be taken in the quarter ending December 31, 2014 would reduce our net earnings in such quarter by an amount between $4 million and $8 million. This pro forma estimated range of net earnings reduction is based on current management estimates and assumptions that are subject to change over time. The actual amount of the required charge, if any, may differ materially from this current estimate. Key factors impacting the calculation include, but are not limited to, our stock price on the date of the \u201cownership change\u201d, the applicable tax-exempt interest rate, the tax basis and fair market value of our assets, federal and state tax regulations, projections of future taxable income and prior NOL usage.\nNegative tax consequences can have an unanticipated effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to the tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our operations and results is sometimes open to interpretation. Because our income tax expense for any period depends heavily on the mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions, our income tax expense and reported net income may fluctuate significantly, and may be materially different than forecasted or experienced in the past. Our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or tax liability could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of examinations of previously filed tax returns, and ongoing assessments of our tax exposures.\nAdverse judgments in regulatory actions, product claims, environmental claims and other litigation could be costly. Insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. While we strive to ensure that our products comply with applicable government regulatory standards and internal requirements, and that our products perform effectively and safely, customers from time to time could claim that our products do not meet warranty or contractual requirements, and users could claim to be harmed by use or misuse of our products. These claims could give rise to breach of contract, warranty or recall claims, or claims for negligence, product liability, strict liability, personal injury or property damage. They could also result in negative publicity.\nIn addition, claims and investigations may arise related to patent infringement, distributor relationships, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law requirements, employment matters, employee benefits issues, and other compliance and regulatory matters, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. While we have processes and policies designed to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we cannot predict or, in some cases, control the costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. In addition, the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant judgment or claim is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact. We cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIncreased costs of labor, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity could delay or impede production and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nIncreased costs of U.S. and international labor, including the costs of employee benefits plans, labor disputes, work stoppages or union organizing activity could delay or impede production and have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. As the majority of our manufacturing employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements, we often incur costs attributable to periodic renegotiation of those agreements, which may be difficult to project. We are also subject to the risk that strikes or other conflicts with organized personnel may arise or that we may become the subject of union organizing activity at our facilities that do not currently have union representation. Prolonged negotiations, conflicts or related activities could also lead to costly work stoppages and loss of productivity.\nOur intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products or brands, which could adversely impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe rely on our proprietary intellectual property, including numerous patents and registered trademarks, as well as our licensed intellectual property to market, promote and sell our products. We monitor and protect against activities that might infringe, dilute, or otherwise harm our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property and rely on the patent, trademark and other laws of the United States and other countries. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization. In addition, the laws of some non-United States jurisdictions, particularly those of certain emerging markets, provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the United States and present greater risks of counterfeiting and other infringement. To the extent we cannot protect our intellectual property, unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could harm our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe outsource our information technology infrastructure and certain finance and accounting functions, which makes us more dependent upon third parties.\nIn an effort to make our finance, accounting and information technology (\u201cIT\u201d), functions more efficient, increase related capabilities, as well as generate cost savings, we outsource certain finance and accounting functions and a significant portion of our IT infrastructure to separate third party service providers. As a result, we rely on third parties to ensure that our related needs are sufficiently met. This reliance subjects us to risks arising from the loss of control over certain processes, changes in pricing that may affect our operating results, and potentially, termination of provisions of these services by our suppliers. A failure of our service providers to perform may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operation.\nOur cost saving initiatives may not achieve expected savings in our operating costs or improved operating results.\nWe aggressively look for ways to make our operations more efficient and effective. We reduce, move and expand our plants and operations as needed. Such actions involve substantial planning, often require capital investments and may result in charges for fixed asset impairments or obsolescence and substantial severance costs. Our ability to achieve cost savings and other benefits within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 91516, "SIC": 3290, "TIC": "AWI"}
