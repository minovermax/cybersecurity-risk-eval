{"cik": "1357971", "company": "Energy Services of America CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-12-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk and uncertainties described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business financial condition and results of operations could be impacted, and we may not be able to achieve our expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled \u201cForward looking statements\u201d.\nRisk Related to our Operations\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe typically experience lower volumes and lower margins during the winter months due to lower demand for our pipeline services and more difficult operating conditions. Also, other items that can materially affect our quarterly results include:\n\u25cf Adverse weather;\n\u25cf Variations in the mix of our work in any quarter;\n\u25cf Shortage of qualified labor;\n\u25cf Unfavorable regional, national or global economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf A reduction in the demand for our services;\n\u25cf Changes in customer spending patterns and need for the services we provide;\n\u25cf Unanticipated increases in construction and design costs;\n\u25cf Timing and volume of work we perform;\n\u25cf Termination of existing agreements;\n\u25cf Losses experienced not covered by insurance;\n\u25cf Payment risks associated with customer financial condition;\n\u25cf Changes in bonding requirements of agreements;\n\u25cf Supply chain constraints;\n\u25cf Interest rate variations; and\n\u25cf Changes in accounting and financial reporting standards.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company completed the acquisitions of Tri-State Paving and Ryan Construction. The Company may choose to expand by making additional acquisitions that could be material to its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Acquisitions involve many risks, including the following:\n\u25cf an acquisition may negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;\n\u25cf the Company may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the operations of any company that it acquires, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us;\n\u25cf an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;\n\u25cf an acquisition may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which the Company has little or no prior experience or where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf if the Company incurs debt to fund such acquisition, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business as well as financial maintenance covenants; and\n\u25cf to the extent that the Company issues a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisk Related to our Business\nThe type of contracts we obtain could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe enter into various types of contracts, including fixed price and variable pricing contracts. On fixed price contracts our profits could be curtailed or eliminated by unanticipated pricing increases associated with the contract.\nA portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds. We may be unable to compete on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds.\nCurrent or future market conditions, including losses in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our surety providers\u2019 assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of bonds for our work or could increase our bonding costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. Since a growing number of our customers require such bonding, should our surety providers limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our performance could be negatively impacted if we are unable to replace the bonded business with work that does not require bonding or if we are unable to provide other means of securing the jobs performance such as with letters of credit or cash.\nMany of our contracts can be cancelled or delayed or may not be renewed upon completion.\nIf our customers should cancel or delay many projects, our revenues could be reduced if we are unable to replace these contracts with others. Also, we have contracts that expire and are renewed periodically. If we are unsuccessful in renewing those contracts, that could reduce our revenue as well.\nOur business requires a skilled labor force and if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our ability to maintain our productivity could be impaired.\nOur productivity depends upon our ability to employ and maintain skilled personnel to meet our requirements. Should some of our key managers leave the Company, it could limit our productivity. Also, many of our labor personnel are trade union members. Should we encounter labor problems associated with our union employees or if we are unable to employ enough available operators, welders, or other skilled labor, our production could be significantly curtailed.\nOur backlog may not be realized.\nOur backlog could be reduced due to cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in scope of the projects. Should this occur, our anticipated revenues would be reduced unless we are able to replace those contracts.\nWe extend credit to customers for purchases of our services and therefore have risk that they may not be able to repay us.\nWhile we have not had any significant problems with collections of accounts receivables historically, should there be an economic downturn our customers\u2019 ability to repay us could be compromised, and this may curtail our operations and ability to operate profitably.\nOur dependence on suppliers, subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to risk of loss in our operations.\nOn certain projects, we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services. We also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment needed to conduct our operations. Any limitation on the availability of materials or equipment or failure to complete work on a timely basis by subcontractors in a quality fashion could lead to added costs and therefore lower profitability for the Company.\nWe face cybersecurity risk including the breach of confidential personal information, Company or customer intellectual properties, and delays related to data loss.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger and other systems. Our computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. Our operational risks include the risk of malfeasance by employees or persons outside our company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems, and business continuation and disaster recovery. There have been increasing efforts by third parties to breach data security. Such attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information, damages to systems, or other material disruptions to network access or business operations. The Company uses industry-leading firewall hardware and runs anti-malware, antivirus, and anti-exploit solutions on all computers as a first line of defense to prevent security breaches. The Company\u2019s email software utilizes spam blocking, phishing filtering, and external sender warnings. The Company uses compartmentalized network drive access to mitigate ransomware damage and performs daily encrypted backups to secure offsite locations including a disaster recovery site.\nAlthough we take protective measures and believe that we have not experienced any of the data breaches described above, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Because the techniques used to cause security breaches change frequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nInflation can have an adverse impact on our business and on our customers.\nInflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. Recently, there have been market indicators of a pronounced rise in inflation and the Federal Reserve has raised certain benchmark interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. Inflation generally increases the cost of goods and services we will use in our business operations, such as electricity and other utilities, which increases our expenses. In addition, we may have to increase both wages to retain our employees and the cost of our services by a greater amount than we have budgeted. Furthermore, our customers will also be affected by inflation and the rising costs of goods and services used in their businesses, which could have a negative impact on their ability to use our services and afford to pay our fees.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. Our efforts to take these risks into account may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nRisk Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe have operations in multiple states and face risks related to the Coronavirus/COVID 19 global pandemic that could impact our results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of the widespread outbreak of Coronavirus and related variants (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d). The outbreak of COVID-19 and other adverse public health developments may have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to complete our projects, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers. Any disruption of our suppliers or customers would likely impact our operating results. In addition, the continued outbreak of COVID-19 could continue to adversely affect the economies of the states that we operate in resulting in a long-term economic downturn that could impact our operating results.\nThe SBA may review the Company\u2019s PPP Loan forgiveness application and if the SBA disagrees with the Company\u2019s certification the Company could be subject to penalties and the repayment of the PPP Loans, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Company received notification of forgiveness on the $9.8 million in PPP loans received in calendar year 2020. The Company must retain PPP loan documentation in its files for six years after the date of forgiveness. The Company believes it meets the SBA\u2019s certification requirement based on its limited access to capital, weakened business operations during the pandemic and small market value. The Company\u2019s shares of common stock did not trade on a national exchange at the time we applied for PPP loans and at the time such loans were forgiven by the SBA.\nThe Company has not received any notifications related to an audit; however, the Company has provided additional payroll costs information for two companies as requested by the SBA through the Company\u2019s lender. The Company has received no other requests or questions. However, no assurance can be given as to the outcome if the SBA re-evaluates the Company\u2019s loan certification. The SBA could determine that the Company does not qualify in whole or in part for loan forgiveness. In addition, it is unknown what type of penalties could be assessed against the Company if the SBA disagrees with the Company\u2019s certification. The Company could be required to repay its PPP Loans. Any penalties in addition to the potential repayment of the PPP Loans could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nRisk Related to our Industry\nAn economic downturn in the industries we serve could lead to less demand for our services.\nIn addition to the effects of an economic recession, there could be reductions in the industries that the Company serves. If the demand for natural gas should drop dramatically, or the demand for electrical and mechanical services drops dramatically, these would in turn result in less demand for the Company\u2019s services.\nProject delays or cancellations may result in additional costs to us, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages.\nIn certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or are paid only upon achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels. Failure to meet any of these requirements could result in additional costs or penalties which could exceed the expected project profits.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nOur industry has been and remains competitive with competitors ranging from small owner operated companies to large public companies. Within that group there may be companies with lower overhead costs that may be able to price their services at lower levels than we can. Accordingly, if that occurs, our business opportunities could be severely limited. In addition, our industry competes for energy demand with suppliers of alternative energy sources such as solar and wind.\nWe may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth.\nOur ability to generate internal growth will be affected by our ability to:\n\u25cf Attract new customers;\n\u25cf Expand our relationships with existing customers;\n\u25cf Hire and maintain qualified employees;\n\u25cf Expand geographically; and\n\u25cf Adjust quickly to changes in our industry.\nRisk Related to Financing\nCredit facilities to fund our operations and growth might not be available.\nOur business relies heavily on having lines of credit in place to fund the various projects we are working on. Should funding not be available, or on favorable terms, it could severely curtail our operations and the ability to generate profits. Energy Services maintains a banking relationship with two regional banks and has lines of credit and borrowing facilities with these institutions. On July 13, 2022, the Company renewed its $15.0 million operating line of credit with United Bank. Based on the borrowing base calculation, the Company could borrow up to $12.5 million as of September 30, 2022. The Company had borrowed $12.5 million on the line of credit as of September 30, 2022, leaving no borrowings available on the line of credit as of that date. The Company believes this line of credit will provide enough operating capital for future projects, but the Company and its lenders are working on a financing package that could expand the current operating line. The Company cannot guarantee it will always have access to this line of credit in the future depending on the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nRisk Related to our Financial Performance\nRevenue and cost estimates on projects may differ from actual results.\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. While the Company believes estimates on project performance are materially correct at September 30, 2022, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nRisk Related to Law and Regulatory Compliance\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may in the ordinary course of business be named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, worker\u2019s compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damages, civil penalties and other losses of injunctive or declaratory relief. Also, we often indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them. Because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers\u2019 infrastructure, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems we work on. While we carry insurance to protect the Company against such claims, the outcomes of any of the lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention from the business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our reputation, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational harm relating to occupational health and safety matters.\nOur operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we are constantly monitoring our health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operating risk and there can be no assurance given that we will avoid significant liability exposure and/or be precluded from working for various customers due to high incident rates.\nChanges by the government in laws regulating the industries we serve could reduce our sales volumes.\nIf the government enacts legislation that has a serious impact on the industries we serve, it could lead to the curtailment of capital projects in those industries and therefore lead to lower sales volumes for our Company.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous materials, as well as fuel storage. We also work around and under bodies of water. We invest significantly in compliance with the appropriate laws and regulations. However, if we should inadvertently cause contamination of waters or soils, liabilities for our Company relating to cleanup and remediation could be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we might have and result in a negative impact to the Company\u2019s ability to operate.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is not heavily traded, and the stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cESOA.\u201d Certain brokers currently make a market in the common stock, but such transactions are infrequent, and the volume of shares traded is relatively small. Management cannot predict whether these or other brokers will continue to make a market in our common stock. Prices on stock that is not heavily traded, such as our common stock, can be more volatile than heavily traded stock. Factors such as our financial results, the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors, publicity regarding our industry, and various other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of the shares of the common stock. Management also cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained in the future. Accordingly, stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of our common stock at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire.\nOur directors beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock and have substantial influence over us.\nOur directors, as a group, beneficially owned approximately 36.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30, 2022. As a result of this level of ownership, our directors have the ability, by taking coordinated action, to exercise significant influence over our affairs and policies. The interests of our directors may not be consistent with your interests as a stockholder. This influence may also have the effect of delaying or preventing changes of control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our Company.", "PERMNO": 91522, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "ESOA"}
