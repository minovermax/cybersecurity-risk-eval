{"cik": "933590", "company": "Your Community Bankshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are a number of factors, including those specified below, that may adversely affect our business, financial results or stock price. Additional risks that we currently do not know about or currently view as immaterial may also impair our business or adversely impact our financial results or stock price.\nAs used in this Item 1A, the terms \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Your Community Bankshares, Inc., an Indiana corporation and its subsidiaries (unless the context clearly implies otherwise).\nIndustry Risk Factors\nEconomic Conditions. The Company\u2019s success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic or political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, inflation, money supply and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control may adversely affect its asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, our earnings. Because the Company has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s earnings. In addition, substantially all of the Company\u2019s loans are to individuals and businesses in our market area. Consequently, any economic decline in the Company\u2019s primary market areas, which include southern Indiana and Elizabethtown, Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nEnactment of Dodd-Frank and the promulgation of regulations thereunder could significantly increase our compliance and operating costs or otherwise have a material and adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Government efforts to strengthen the U.S. financial system have resulted in the imposition of additional regulatory requirements, including expansive financial services regulatory reform legislation. Dodd-Frank sets out sweeping regulatory changes. Changes imposed by Dodd-Frank affecting our business include, among others: (i) new requirements on banking, derivative and investment activities, including modified capital requirements, the repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on business demand accounts, and debit card interchange fee requirements; (ii) enhanced financial institution safety and soundness regulations, including increases in assessment fees and deposit insurance coverage; and (iii) the establishment of new regulatory bodies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Many of the requirements of Dodd-Frank are still being implemented and will not become fully effective for several years.\nCurrent and future legal and regulatory requirements, restrictions and regulations, including those imposed under Dodd-Frank, may adversely impact our profitability and may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These requirements, restrictions and regulations may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes required by the legislation and accompanying rules and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees. See previous discussion under \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d for more information on Dodd-Frank.\nChanges in the laws, regulations and policies governing financial services companies could alter our business environment and adversely affect our operations. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary policies determine in a large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. Federal Reserve Board policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments that we hold, such as debt securities.\nWe, along with our subsidiaries, are heavily regulated at the federal and state levels. This regulation is to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes in statutes, regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of financial services and products that we offer and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. We cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could intensify and adversely affect our financial results. We operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. We compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions and investment companies. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures. Also, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which we and the financial services industry are highly dependent, could present operational issues and require capital spending.\nChanges in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our financial results. Technology and other changes now allow many consumers to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank and can access loans through lending groups and other non-regulated entities. This \u201cdisintermediation\u201d could result in the loss of fee and interest income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers.\nRisks associated with unpredictable economic and political conditions may be amplified as a result of our limited market area. Commercial banks and other financial institutions are affected by economic and political conditions, both domestic and international, and by governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, value of the dollar, recession, unemployment, high interest rates, short money supply, scarce natural resources, international disorders, terrorism and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect profitability. In addition, almost all of our primary business area is located in the Louisville, Kentucky metropolitan statistical area. A significant downturn in this regional economy may result in, among other things, deterioration in our credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and may harm the financial stability of our customers. Due to the regional market area, these negative conditions may have a more noticeable effect on us than would be experienced by an institution with a larger, more diverse market area.\nChanges in the domestic interest rate environment could reduce our net interest income. Interest rate volatility could significantly harm our business. Our results of operations are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory policies of governmental authorities. A significant component of earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the income from interest-earning assets, such as loans, and the expense of interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. A change in market interest rates could adversely affect earnings if market interest rates change such that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we collect on loans and investments. Consequently, along with other financial institutions generally, we are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.\nThe FDIC\u2019s restoration plan and the related increased assessment rate could affect our earnings. As a result of a series of financial institution failures and other market developments, the deposit insurance fund, or DIF, of the FDIC has been significantly depleted and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. In response to the recent economic conditions and the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the FDIC has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required which we may be required to pay. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have a materially adverse effect on the value or market for our common stock.\nCompany Risk Factors\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses which is established through a provision for loan losses based on management\u2019s evaluation of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio and the general economy. The allowance is based upon a number of factors, including the size of the loan portfolio, asset classifications, economic trends, industry experience and trends, industry and geographic concentrations, estimated collateral values, management\u2019s assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio, historical loan loss experience and loan underwriting policies. In addition, we evaluate all loans identified as problem loans and augment the allowance based upon our estimation of the loss associated with those problem loans. Additions to our allowance for loan losses decrease our net income.\nOur estimates are subjective, and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events. Changes in economic, operating, and other conditions that are generally beyond our control could cause actual loan losses to increase significantly. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their supervisory functions, periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. Regulatory agencies may from time to time require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize additional loan charge-offs when their judgment has differed from ours. Any of these events could have a material negative impact on our operating results.\nWe may suffer losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices. Our results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Lending money is an essential part of the banking business. However, borrowers do not always repay their loans. The risk of non-payment is historically small, but if nonpayment levels are greater than anticipated, our earnings and overall financial condition, as well as the value of our common stock, could be adversely affected. No assurance can be given that our underwriting practices or monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks. Loan losses can cause insolvency and failure of a financial institution and, in such an event, our shareholders could lose their entire investment. In addition, future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect profitability. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans.\nOur loan portfolio is predominantly secured by real estate and thus we have a higher degree of risk from a downturn in our real estate markets. A further downturn in our real estate markets could hurt our business because many of our loans are secured by real estate. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature. Substantially all of our real estate collateral is located in Southern Indiana, Scottsburg, Indiana, and Elizabethtown, Lexington, Louisville and Bardstown, Kentucky. If real estate values, including values of land held for development, decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be significantly reduced. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Commercial real estate loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or group of related borrowers. Since payments on these loans often depend on the successful operation or management of the properties, as well as the business and financial condition of the borrower, adverse conditions in the real estate market, adverse economic conditions or changes in applicable government regulations all could adversely affect repayment of our commercial real estate loans.\nAdditional risks associated with our construction loan portfolio include failure of contractors to complete construction on a timely basis or at all, market deterioration during construction, cost overruns and failure to sell or lease the security underlying the construction loans so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by our borrower. Construction loans generally carry a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of existing properties because repayment depends on the ultimate completion of the project and often on the sale of the property. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to its completion, we may not be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan or we may be required to fund additional money to complete the project, or hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. During an economic downturn, declines in real estate values coupled with an associated increase in unemployment, may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, a decline in demand for our products and services, or a lack of growth or decrease in deposits, which may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital or hurt our business.\nMaintaining or increasing our market share may depend on lowering prices and market acceptance of new products and services. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our businesses may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. We might not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.\nWe may experience interruptions or breaches in our information system security. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure or interruption of these information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions of these information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach, including cyber attacks, of our operational or security systems, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our clients and that may result in financial losses to us or our clients, privacy breaches against our clients, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, and other dishonest acts. In recent periods, there has been a rise in fraudulent electronic activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector, due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity in recent periods.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks and those of our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses by us and/or our customers. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties, such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe maintain an insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot assure that this policy will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing attack.\nAcquisitions and the addition of branch facilities may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties. We regularly explore opportunities to establish branch facilities and acquire other banks or financial institutions. New or acquired branch facilities and other facilities may not be profitable. We may not be able to correctly identify profitable locations for new branches. The costs to start up new branch facilities or to acquire existing branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase our noninterest expense and decrease earnings in the short term. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage growth through the establishment of these branches. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these branch sites will successfully attract enough deposits to offset the expenses of operating these branch sites. Any new or acquired branches will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in securing such approvals.\nThe required accounting treatment of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans we acquired through business combinations and FDIC-assisted transactions could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest margins and interest income in future periods. Under U.S. GAAP, we record loans acquired at a discount (that is due, in part, to credit,) at fair value which may underestimate the actual performance of such loans. As a result, if these loans outperform our original fair value estimates, the difference between our original estimate and the actual performance of the loan (the \u201cdiscount\u201d) is accreted into net interest income. Thus, our net interest margins may initially appear higher. We expect the yields on our loans to decline as our acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures and we expect downward pressure on our interest income to the extent that the runoff on our acquired loan portfolio is not replaced with comparable high-yielding loans. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margin and lower interest income in future periods.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled people. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for talent in most activities in which we engage can be intense. We may not be able to hire the best people or to keep them.\nWe may incur losses in our investments portfolio. Our investment portfolio is comprised of state and municipal securities, residential mortgage-backed agencies issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities securities, corporate bonds, mutual funds, and U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies. We must evaluate these securities for other-than-temporary impairment loss (\u201cOTTI\u201d) on a periodic basis. We may need to record OTTI charges in our investments in the future should the issuers of those securities experience financial difficulties. Any future OTTI charges could significantly impact our earnings.\nSignificant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities. From time to time we are subject to claims related to our operations. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. To protect us from the cost of these claims, we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. However, our insurance coverage may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is a limited trading market for our stock and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. The price of the common stock purchased may decrease significantly. Although our common shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cYCB\u201d, trading activity in our shares historically has been sporadic. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of liquidity and order depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers at any given time. The presence of willing buyers and sellers depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic conditions, all of which are beyond our control.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. Liquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole.\nOur status as a holding company makes us dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. We are a bank holding company and conduct almost all of our operations through YCB and CBIN Insurance, Inc. We do not have any significant assets other than cash and the stock of YCB and CBIN Insurance, Inc. Accordingly, we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and obtain revenue. Our right to participate in any distribution of earnings or assets of our subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiaries. Under federal and state law, our bank subsidiaries are limited in the amount of dividends they may pay to us without prior regulatory approval. The Banks must maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and be in compliance with other general regulatory restrictions. Bank regulators have the authority to prohibit the subsidiary banks from paying dividends if the bank regulators determine the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. As of December 31, 2015, our subsidiaries did not have the ability to pay us dividends without prior regulatory approval.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to certain limitations and restrictions, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue paying the same level of dividends in the future that we paid in 2015 or that we will be able to pay future dividends at all. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. The ability of Your Community Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to these banks, including state regulatory requirements. The FDIC and other bank regulators have proposed guidelines and seek greater liquidity, and have been discussing increasing capital requirements. If these regulatory requirements are not met, our subsidiary banks will not be able to pay dividends to us, and we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nIn addition, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Federal Reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments (i.e., perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt) in light of our earnings, capital adequacy and financial condition. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve indicates that the board of directors of a bank holding company (including a financial holding company) should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the dividends if:\n\u00b7\nthe company\u2019s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n\u00b7\nthe prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or\n\u00b7\nthe company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are unable to meet a debt covenant and, correspondingly, unable to obtain a waiver regarding the debt covenant from the lender. From time to time we may obtain financing from other lenders. The loan documents reflecting the financing often require us to meet various debt covenants. If we are unable to meet one or more of our debt covenants, then we will typically attempt to obtain a waiver from the lender. If the lender does not agree to a waiver, then we will be in default under our borrowing obligation. This default could affect our ability to fund various strategies that we may have implemented resulting in a negative impact in our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to properties. In the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 81546, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "YCB"}
