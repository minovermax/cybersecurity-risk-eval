{"cik": "1602078", "company": "Nemaura Medical Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Product Candidate and Operation\nWe are largely dependent on the success of our sole product candidate, the sugarBEAT device, and we may not be able to successfully commercialize this potential product.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs relating to the development and marketing of our sole product candidate, the sugarBEAT device. We have not obtained approval to market this potential product in any jurisdiction and we may never be able to obtain approval or, if approvals are obtained, to commercialize this product successfully.\nIf we fail to successfully commercialize our product(s), we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow our business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval of the sugarBEAT device or any of our other future products, we will be unable to commercialize these potential products.\nThe development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of our product is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in Great Britain and the European Union. In particular, the process of obtaining CE approval by a Notified Body, a third party that can carry out a conformity assessment recognized by the European Union, is costly and time consuming, and the time required for such approval is uncertain. Our product must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and an extensive regulatory approval process mandated for the CE. Such regulatory review includes the determination of manufacturing capability and product performance. As of the date of this filing we have not applied for CE approval for the latest version of our product.\nWhilst we have received a CE approval on our current sugarBEAT device, which excludes any wireless communication capabilities, we can give no assurance that our future products will be approved by the European Union or Great Britain or any other governmental body. In addition, there can be no assurance that all necessary approvals will be granted for future products or that CE review or actions will not involve delays caused by requests for additional information or testing that could adversely affect the time to market for and sale of our product. Further failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things; result in the suspension of regulatory approval as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions.\nFailure to enroll patients in our clinical trials may cause delays in developing the sugarBEAT device or any of our future products.\nWe may encounter delays in the development and commercialization, or fail to obtain marketing approval, of the sugarBEAT device or any other future products if we are unable to enrol enough patients to complete clinical trials. Our ability to enrol sufficient numbers of patients in our clinical trials depends on many factors, including the severity of illness of the population, the size of the patient population, the nature of the clinical protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, and the eligibility criteria for the trial and competing clinical trials. Delays in planned patient enrolment may result in increased costs and harm our ability to complete our clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval.\nDelays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenue.\nSignificant delays in clinical testing could materially adversely impact our product development costs. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence and continue a study, delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study terms with prospective sites, delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a study at a prospective site and delays in recruiting patients to participate in a study.\nSignificant delays in testing or regulatory approvals for any of our current or future products, including the sugarBEAT device, could prevent or cause delays in the commercialization of such product candidates, reduce potential revenues from the sale of such product candidates and cause our costs to increase.\nOur clinical trials for any of our current or future products may produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing for these products or cease our trials.\nWe will only receive regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate if we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory agency that the product is safe and effective. We do not know whether our future clinical trials will demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficiently to result in marketable products. Because our clinical trials for the sugarBEAT device may produce negative or inconclusive results, we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing for this product or cease our clinical trials. If this occurs, we may not be able to obtain approval for this product or our anticipated time to market for this product may be substantially delayed and we may also experience significant additional development costs. We may also be required to undertake additional clinical testing if we change or expand the indications for our product.\nIf approved, the commercialization of our product, the sugarBEAT device, may not be profitable due to the need to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or make arrangements with a third party to perform these functions.\nIn order for the commercialization of our potential product to be profitable, our product must be cost-effective and economical to manufacture on a commercial scale. Subject to regulatory approval, we expect to incur significant sales, marketing, distribution, and to the extent we do not outsource manufacturing, manufacturing expenses in connection with the commercialization of the sugarBEAT device and our other potential products. We do not currently have a dedicated sales force or manufacturing capability, and we have no experience in the sales, marketing and distribution of medical diagnostic device products. In order to commercialize the sugarBEAT device or any of our other potential products that we may develop, we must develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with a third party to perform these functions. Developing a sales force is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to develop this capacity. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and may not become profitable. Our future profitability will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of developing a commercial scale manufacturing facility or the costs of outsourcing the manufacturing of the sugarBEAT device;\n\u00b7 receipt of regulatory approval of the sugarBEAT device;\n\u00b7 the terms of any marketing restrictions or post-marketing commitments imposed as a condition of approval by regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 costs of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7 the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u00b7 the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for the sugarBEAT device or any other product candidates, we may never receive significant revenues from any of them. To the extent that we are not successful in commercializing our potential products, we will incur significant additional losses if we do not successfully commercialize our products.\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property and product and if we cannot obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property and product, we may not be able to successfully market our product.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection for our technologies and product. We will only be able to protect our technologies and product from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents cover them, or that other market exclusionary rights apply. While we have issued enforceable patents covering the sugarBEAT device, the patent positions of companies like ours can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies' patents has emerged to date in Great Britain and the European Union. The general patent environment outside the United States involves significant uncertainty. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or that the scope of these patent rights would provide a sufficient degree of future protection that would permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage with respect to this product and technology. Additionally, companies like ours are dependent on creating a pipeline of products. We may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies or products that produce commercially viable products or that are themselves patentable.\nOur issued patents may be subject to challenge and possibly invalidated by third parties. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in Great Britain or the European Union or other countries may diminish the market exclusionary ability of our intellectual property.\nIn addition, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies that may be outside the scope of our intellectual property. Should third parties obtain patent rights to similar technology, this may have an adverse effect on our business.\nTo the extent that consultants or key employees apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our product, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights of the information, which may not be resolved in our favour. Consultants and key employees that work with our confidential and proprietary technologies are required to assign all intellectual property rights in their discoveries to us. However, these consultants or key employees may terminate their relationship with us, and we cannot preclude them indefinitely from dealing with our competitors. If our trade secrets become known to competitors with greater experience and financial resources, the competitors may copy or use our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies. If we were to prosecute a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, courts in Great Britain and the European Union are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than courts in the United States. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, we would lack any contractual claim to this information, and our business could be harmed.\nOur ability to commercialize our product will depend on our ability to sell such products without infringing the patent or proprietary rights of third parties. If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation will be costly and time consuming and an unfavorable outcome would have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to commercialize our product will depend on our ability to sell such products without infringing the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Third-party intellectual property in the field of diagnostic medical devices is complicated, and third-party intellectual property rights in this field are continuously evolving. We have not performed searches for third-party intellectual property rights that may raise freedom-to-operate issues, and we have not obtained legal opinions regarding commercialization of our product other than patent research prior to the filing of our patent applications, and search and examination reports from the respective patent examination offices.\nIn addition, because patent applications are published months after their filing, and because applications can take several years to issue, there may be currently pending third-party patent applications that are unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents. If a third-party claims that we infringe on its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of issues that could seriously harm our competitive position, including:\n\u00b7 infringement claims that, with or without merit, can be costly and time consuming to litigate, can delay the regulatory approval process and can divert management's attention from our core business strategy;\n\u00b7 substantial damages for past infringement which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe upon a competitor's patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 if a license is available from a holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights; and\n\u00b7 Re-designing our process so that it does not infringe the third-party intellectual property, which may not be possible, or which may require substantial time and expense including delays in bringing our own products to market.\nSuch actions could harm our competitive position and our ability to generate revenue and could result in increased costs.\nNemaura Medical Inc. is an Emerging Growth Company (EGC) as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.\nAn \"emerging growth company\" is an issuer whose initial public offering was or will be completed after Dec. 8, 2011, and had total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. An issuer's EGC status terminates on the earliest of:\n\u00b7 The last day of the first fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more;\n\u00b7 The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the issuer's initial public offering;\n\u00b7 The date on which such issuer has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period determined on a rolling basis; or\n\u00b7 The date on which the issuer is deemed to be a \"large accelerated filer\" under the Exchange Act, which means, among other things, that it has a public float in excess of $700 million.\nPursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Company's financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.\nThe Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b)(2)(B) of the Act. Among other things, this means that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company, the Company may elect not to provide certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers that would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the Company. As a result, investor confidence in the Company and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs an Emerging Growth Company our investors could suffer the loss of their investment in the event of a downturn of the economy, the loss of one or more of the Officers or Directors, broad market fluctuations, or revenues and operating results falling below our expectations.\nIf our product, the sugarBEAT device, does not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, we will be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.\nThe sugarBEAT device that we developed may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community. If we receive the regulatory approvals necessary for commercialization, the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 limited indications of regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our product and its potential advantages over existing diagnostic medical devices;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u00b7 our ability to offer our product at an acceptable price;\n\u00b7 the relative convenience and ease of use of our product;\n\u00b7 the strength of marketing and distribution support; and\n\u00b7 sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nThe market may not accept the sugarBEAT device based on any number of the above factors. If the sugarBEAT device is approved, there may be other therapies available which directly compete for the same target market. The market may choose to continue utilizing the existing products for any number of reasons, including familiarity with or pricing of these existing products. The failure of any of our product to gain market acceptance could impair our ability to generate revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business.\nWe have no commercial manufacturing facility for our sugarBEAT device and no experience in manufacturing products for commercial purposes and the failure to find manufacturing partners or create a manufacturing facility ourselves could have an adverse impact on our ability to grow our business.\nWe have no commercial manufacturing facility for the sugarBEAT device and no experience in manufacturing commercial quantities of our product. As such, we are dependent on third parties to supply our product according to our specifications, in sufficient quantities, on time, in compliance with appropriate regulatory standards and at competitive prices. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of our product candidates on acceptable terms, or at all.\nManufacturers supplying diagnostic medical devices must comply with regulations which require, among other things, compliance with evolving regulations under Medical Device Directives stipulated under ISO13485. The manufacturing of products at any facility will be subject to strict quality control, testing and record keeping requirements, and continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post-market information. Both the sensor and patch manufacturing facilities for the sugarBEAT device are currently ISO13485 certified. We cannot guarantee that the facilities will continue to pass regulatory inspection, or that future changes to ISO13485 standards will not also affect the manufactures of the sensors and patches.\nIf we fail to attract and retain senior management, consultants, advisors and scientific and technical personnel, our product development and commercialization efforts could be impaired.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel, particularly Dr. Dewan Fazlul Hoque Chowdhury, President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Although we have entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Chowdhury, there is no assurance that he will remain in our employ for the entire term of such employment agreement. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or our scientific or technical staff may significantly delay or prevent the development of our product and other business objectives by diverting management's attention to transition matters and identification of suitable replacements, if any, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development strategy. All of our consultants and advisors are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have conflicts of interest or other commitments, such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations, that may affect their ability to contribute to us.\nIn addition, we believe that we will need to recruit additional executive management and scientific and technical personnel. There is currently intense competition for skilled executives and employees with relevant scientific and technical expertise, and this competition is likely to continue. The inability to attract and retain sufficient scientific, technical and managerial personnel could limit or delay our product development efforts, which would adversely affect the development of our product and commercialization of our potential product and growth of our business.\nWe expect to expand our research, development, clinical research and marketing capabilities and, as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to have significant growth in expenditures, the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, in particular with respect to those potential products that we elect to commercialize independently or together with others. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to train qualified personnel. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plan or disrupt our operations.\nWe will need to raise additional funds in order to finance the anticipated commercialization of our product by incurring indebtedness, through collaboration and licensing arrangements, or by issuing securities which may cause dilution to existing stockholders, or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies and our product.\nDeveloping our product, conducting clinical trials, establishing manufacturing facilities and developing marketing and distribution capabilities is expensive. We will need to finance future cash needs through additional public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe have a limited operating history and you should not rely on our historical financial data as an indicator of our future financial performance.\nWe have a limited operating history in the medical device industry. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we face with our limited operating history and should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. In particular, we may face challenges in planning our growth strategy and forecasting market demand accurately as a result of our limited historical data and limited experience in implementing and evaluating our business strategies. If we are unable to successfully address these risks, difficulties and challenges as a result of our limited operating history, our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely affected, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses every year since our inception in 2009 and have not generated revenue from the period of our inception from product sales or licenses to date. As of March 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $7.2 million. We may expect to incur losses for the next several years and cannot be certain that we will ever achieve profitability. As a result, our business is subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise, such as the risk that we may not obtain substantial additional capital needed to support the expenses of developing our technology and commercializing our potential products; develop a market for our potential products; successfully transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of either manufacturing and selling potential products or profitably licensing our potential products to others; and/or attract and retain qualified management, technical and scientific staff.\nWe currently have not generated any revenue from product sales and may never become profitable.\nTo date, we have generated no revenue for product sales and we do not know when or if our product will generate revenue. Our ability to generate revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully complete clinical trials for the sugarBEAT device and obtain regulatory approval to commercialize these potential products. Even then, we will need to establish and maintain sales, marketing, distribution and to the extent we do not outsource manufacturing, manufacturing capabilities. We plan to rely on one or more strategic collaborators to help generate revenues in markets outside of Great Britain however, we cannot be sure that our collaborators, if any, will be successful. Our ability to generate revenue will also be impacted by certain challenges, risks and uncertainties frequently encountered in the establishment of new technologies and products in emerging markets and evolving industries. These challenges include our ability to:\n\u00b7 execute our business model;\n\u00b7 create brand recognition;\n\u00b7 manage growth in our operations;\n\u00b7 create a customer base cost-effectively;\n\u00b7 retain customers;\n\u00b7 access additional capital when required; and\n\u00b7 attract and retain key personnel.\nWe cannot be certain that our business model will be successful or that it will successfully address these and other challenges, risks and uncertainties. If we are unable to generate significant revenue, we may not become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations. Even if we are able to commercialize the sugarBEAT device, we may not achieve profitability for at least several years, if at all, after generating material revenue.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur functional currency is the Great Britain Pound Sterling (\"GBP\"). The reporting currency is the United States dollar (US$). Income and expenditures are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of balance sheet date. Stockholder's equity is translated into United States dollars from GBP at historical exchange rates. Currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business, including limiting our ability to convert GBP into foreign currencies and, if the GBP were to decline in value, reducing our revenue in U.S. dollar terms. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. Similarly, to the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries' financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). We have not entered into agreements or purchased instruments to hedge our exchange rate risks. The availability and effectiveness of any hedging transaction may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exchange rate risks.\nIn addition, following the UK's Brexit vote to leave the EU, there has been a weakening of GBP against many currencies. We expect to have to pay some of our service providers and vendors in USD and we will pay approximately 15% more at present than we would have done prior to the Brexit vote. The currency exchange rate continues to be very unstable and therefore the future impact or further weakening of GBP is not known at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur competitors may develop products that are less expensive, safer or more effective, which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any potential products that we may commercialize.\nIf our competitor's market products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than our future products developed from our product candidates, or that reach the market before our products, we may not achieve commercial success. For example, if approved, the sugarBEAT device's primary competition in the glucose monitoring device setting will be companies such as Abbott, Dexcom, Echo and Medtronic who produce glucose monitoring devices. The market may choose to continue utilizing the existing products for any number of reasons, including familiarity with or pricing of these existing products. The failure of our product to compete with products marketed by our competitors would impair our ability to generate revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to compete with several companies including Abbott, Dexcom, Echo and Medtronic, and our competitors may:\n\u00b7 develop and market products that are less expensive or more effective than our future product;\n\u00b7 commercialize competing products before we can launch any products developed from our product candidate;\n\u00b7 operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;\n\u00b7 initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;\n\u00b7 have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;\n\u00b7 more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and\n\u00b7 take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.\nWe expect to compete for market share against large medical diagnostic device manufacturing companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger companies, new companies, and other public and private research organizations.\nIn addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in our product discovery process that we believe we derive from our research approach and proprietary technologies.\nThe use of hazardous materials in our operations may subject us to environmental claims or liabilities.\nOur research and development activities involve the use of hazardous chemical materials. Injury or contamination from these materials may occur and we could be held liable for any damages, which could exceed our available financial resources. This liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with extensive regulations enforced by regulatory agencies with respect to diagnostic medical device products, the commercialization of our product could be prevented, delayed or halted.\nResearch, preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing of our product is subject to extensive regulation by various government authorities. We have not received marketing approval for the sugarBEAT device. The process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive, and the time required for such approvals is uncertain. The approval process is affected by such factors as:\n\u00b7 the indication and claims of the diagnostic device;\n\u00b7 the quality of submission relating to the product;\n\u00b7 the product's clinical efficacy and safety;\n\u00b7 the manufacturing facility compliance;\n\u00b7 the availability of alternative devices;\n\u00b7 the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 the patent status and marketing exclusivity rights of certain innovative products.\nAny regulatory approvals that we or our partners receive for our product may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product and withdrawal of the product from the market.\nManufacturing, labelling, storage and distribution activities also are subject to strict regulation and licensing by government authorities. The manufacturing facilities for our product will be subject to periodic inspection by the regulatory authorities and from time to time, these agencies may send notice of deficiencies as a result of such inspections. Our failure or the failure of our manufacturing facilities, to continue to meet regulatory standards or to remedy any deficiencies could result in corrective action by the authorities, including the interruption or prevention of marketing, closure of our manufacturing facilities, and fines or penalties.\nRegulatory authorities also will require post-marketing surveillance to monitor and report potential adverse effects of our product. If approved, any of our products' subsequent failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could, among other things, result in warning letters, fines, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals, product recalls or seizures, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecutions.\nGovernment policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market our product and our business could suffer.\nIn the future, we hope to distribute and sell our product outside of the United Kingdom and the European Union, which will subject us to further regulatory risk.\nIn addition to seeking approval from the United Kingdom and the European Union for the sugarBEAT device, we may seek regulatory approval from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and the USA, to market the sugarBEAT device however there is no guarantee we will do so. We may in the future also seek approvals for additional countries. The regulatory review process varies from country to country, and approval by foreign government authorities is unpredictable, uncertain and generally expensive. The ability to market our product could be substantially limited due to delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, the necessary approvals or clearances. Marketing of our product in these countries, and in most other countries, is not permitted until we have obtained required approvals or exemptions in each individual country. Failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could impair our ability to generate revenue from international sources.\nMarket acceptance of our product will be limited if users are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers.\nGovernment health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement for products like our product and our commercial success will depend in part on these third-party payers agreeing to reimburse patients for the costs of our product. Even if we succeed in bringing our product to market, we cannot assure you that third-party payers will consider our product cost effective or provide reimbursement in whole or in part for its use.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. Our product is intended to replace or alter existing therapies or procedures. These third-party payers may conclude that our product is less safe, effective or cost-effective than existing therapies or procedures. Therefore, third-party payers may not approve our product for reimbursement.\nIf third-party payers do not approve our product for reimbursement or fail to reimburse for them adequately, sales will suffer as some physicians or their patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement or is adequately reimbursed. Even if third-party payers make reimbursement available, these payers' reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability and the ability of our potential collaborators to sell our product on a profitable basis.\nThe trend toward managed healthcare, the growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products, resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our product which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of our product may change in ways adverse to us before or after the regulatory agencies approve our product for marketing. While we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these legislative or regulatory proposals, if any government or regulatory agencies adopt these proposals, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct liability claims may damage our reputation and, if insurance proves inadequate, the product liability claims may harm our business.\nWe may be exposed to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the diagnostic medical device. A product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about our product's safety and efficacy and could limit our ability to sell our product by preventing or interfering with commercialization of our product.\nIn addition, product liability insurance for our industry is generally expensive to the extent it is available at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that we will be able to secure increased coverage if the commercialization of our product progresses, or that future claims against us will be covered by our product liability insurance. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any product liability coverage from any insurance policy and/or any rights of indemnification and contribution that we may have will offset any future claims. We currently do not maintain product liability insurance. A successful claim against us with respect to uninsured liabilities and not subject to any indemnification or contribution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be negatively impacted by the application or enforcement of fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws and other anti-referral laws.\nWe are not aware of any current business practice which is in violation of any fraud and abuse law. However, continued vigilance to assure compliance with all potentially applicable laws will be a necessary expense associated with product development. For example, all product marketing efforts must be strictly scrutinized to assure that they are not associated with improper remunerations to referral sources in violation of any anti-kickback statutes. Remunerations may include potential future activities for our product, including discounts, rebates and bundled sales, which must be appropriately structured to take advantage of statutory and regulatory \"safe harbors.\" From time to time we may engage physicians in consulting activities. In addition, we may decide to sponsor continuing medical education activities for physicians or other medical personnel. We also may award or sponsor study grants to physicians from time to time. All relationships with physicians, including consulting arrangements, continuing medical education and study grants, must be similarly reviewed for compliance with any anti-kickback statute to assure that remuneration is not provided in return for referrals. Patient inducements may also be unlawful. Inaccurate reports of product pricing, or a failure to provide a product at an appropriate price to various governmental entities, could also serve as a basis for an enforcement action under various theories.\nClaims which are \"tainted\" by virtue of kickbacks or a violation of self-referral rules may be alleged as false claims if other elements of a violation are established. Because our potential customers may seek payments from healthcare programs for our product, even during the clinical trial stages, we must assure that we take no actions which could result in the submission of false claims. For example, free product samples which are knowingly or with reckless disregard billed to healthcare programs could constitute false claims. If the practice was facilitated or fostered by us, we could be liable. Moreover, inadequate accounting for or a misuse of grant funds used for product research and development could be alleged as a violation of relevant statutes.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations, and additional legal or regulatory change.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe stock market, particularly in recent years, has experienced significant volatility particularly with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other diagnostic medical device company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other diagnostic medical device company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. Factors that could cause this volatility in the market price of our Common Stock include:\n\u00b7 results from and any delays in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure or delays in entering our product into clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure or discontinuation of any of our research programs;\n\u00b7 delays in establishing new strategic relationships;\n\u00b7 delays in the development or commercialization of our product;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the diagnostic medical device sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts' reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7 actual and anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 issues in manufacturing our product;\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our product;\n\u00b7 third-party healthcare reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7 regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;\n\u00b7 litigation or public concern about the safety of our product; and\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel.\nThese and other external factors may cause the market price and demand for our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Common Stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Common Stock. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nWe have not paid and may not pay any dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe have paid no dividends on our Common Stock to date and may not pay dividends to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. While our future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is currently anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion and for the implementation of our business plan. As an investor, you should take note of the fact that a lack of a dividend can further affect the market value of our stock, and could significantly affect the value of any investment in our Company.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of federal securities laws. This can be expensive and may divert resources from other projects, and thus impairing our ability to grow.\nWe are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and other federal securities laws, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC (including reporting of any Merger that may occur in the future) and furnishing audited reports to stockholders will cause our expenses to be higher than they would have been if we had remained privately held.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our Common Stock.\nWe are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such company's internal control over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Our management has concluded that our internal control over our financial reporting is not effective. Our reporting obligations as a public company will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future.\nPrior to 2014, we were a private company with a short operating history and limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal control and procedures over financial reporting. We have identified material weaknesses, which include (i) the limited segregation of duties and level of supervision and a lack of sufficient personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the application of US GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements, specifically there is a limited review of financial reporting, as well as a review of financial presentation; (ii) limited reconciliations and board approval of related party transactions. We will continue to implement measures to remedy these material weaknesses as well as other deficiencies. If we fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the market price of our commons stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical un-discovered failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement.\nWe have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could have an adverse effect on our ability to report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis.\nWe have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to our (i) inability to employ sufficient personnel to review our financial reports and disclosure matters, and to implement policies and procedures to analyze, document, monitor and report on non-routine and complex transactions that require management estimation or judgment; and (ii) with respect to related party transactions, we have limited policies and procedures to ensure that financial statement disclosures reconcile fully to the underlying accounting records for these transactions and Board approval of these transactions is not properly documented. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have determined that further improvements are required in our accounting processes and personnel before we can consider the material weakness remediated. Management's procedures and testing identified errors that, although not material to the consolidated financial statements, led management to conclude that control deficiencies exist related to the timely production and filing of financial information. As a result of these deficiencies, it is reasonably possible that internal controls over financial reporting may not have prevented or detected errors from occurring that could have been material, either individually or in the aggregate.\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. While considerable actions have been taken and are underway to improve our internal controls in response to the identified material weaknesses and further action steps to strengthen controls have been taken, additional work continues to address and remediate the identified material weakness. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC, which could adversely affect the valuation of our common stock and could adversely affect our business prospects.\nWe do not have any independent directors serving on our board of directors, which could present the potential for conflicts of interest.\nWe do not have a majority of independent directors serving on our board of directors. In the absence of a majority of independent directors, our executive officers could establish policies and enter into transactions without independent review and approval thereof. This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our stockholders, generally, and the controlling officers, stockholders or directors.\nWe do not have a separately designated independent audit committee. Our board of directors performs the functions of an audit committee.\nAn audit committee primarily functions to monitor the integrity and quality of financial reports, sound business risk practices and ethical behavior, compliance with regulatory and legal requirements and has independent oversight of the company\u2019s independent auditor. Because we only have two directors, one of which is also an executive officer, without independent oversight of these functions, there is the potential that management may not have the ability to be objective with respect to certain business practices and to evaluate risk in a manner in which the best interests of the stockholders are considered. This could present the potential for a conflict of interest between us and our stockholders.\nPublic company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our compliance costs in 2017 and beyond and to make certain activities more time consuming and costly. As a public company, we also expect that these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nA limited trading market for our Common Stock may result in limited liquidity for shares of our Common Stock and significant volatility in our stock price.\nOur Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink. The OTC Pink is generally regarded as a less efficient and less prestigious trading market than the other OTC Markets and national securities exchanges. There is no assurance if or when our Common Stock will be quoted on another more prestigious exchange or market. Active trading markets generally result in lower price volatility and more efficient execution of buy and sell orders. The absence of an active trading market reduces the liquidity of our Common Stock.\nThe market price of our stock is likely to be highly volatile because for some time there will likely be a thin trading market for the stock, which causes trades of small blocks of stock to have a significant impact on our stock price. As a result of the lack of trading activity, the quoted price for our Common Stock on OTC Pink is not necessarily a reliable indicator of its fair market value. Further, if we cease to be quoted, holders of our Common Stock would find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our Common Stock, and the market value of our Common Stock would likely decline.\nOur Common Stock will be deemed a \"penny stock,\" which makes it more difficult for our investors to sell their shares.\nOur Common Stock will be subject to the \"penny stock\" rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules generally apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other national securities exchange and trades at less than $5.00 per share, other than companies that have had average revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the last three years or that have tangible net worth of at least $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company has been operating for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than \"established customers\" complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under Rule 144, or issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \"overhang\" and in anticipation of which the market price of our Common Stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nThe interests of Dr. Chowdhury, or the controlling shareholders, may not always coincide with the interests of us and our other shareholders, and the controlling shareholders may exert significant control or substantial influence over us and may take actions that are not in, or may conflict with, public shareholders' best interests.\nThe controlling shareholders will control the exercise of voting rights of over 50 % of the shares eligible to vote in any of our annual or special meeting. Therefore, these controlling shareholders will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain shareholder approval, including the election of directors to our board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. The controlling shareholders may cause us to take actions that are not in, or may conflict with, the interests of us or the public shareholders. In the case where the interests of the controlling shareholders conflict with those of our other shareholders, or if the controlling shareholders choose to cause us to pursue objectives that would conflict with the interests of our other shareholders, such other shareholders could be left in a disadvantageous position by such actions caused by the controlling shareholders and the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes governing business combinations and control share acquisition.\nApplicability of the Nevada business combination statute would discourage parties interested in taking control of our company if they cannot obtain the approval of our board of directors. These provisions could prohibit or delay a merger or other takeover or change in control attempt and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire our company even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price.\nThe effect of the Nevada control share statute is that the acquiring person, and those acting in association with the acquiring person, will obtain only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred by a resolution of the stockholders at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders. The Nevada control share law, if applicable, could have the effect of discouraging takeovers of our company based on our organizational structure.\nWe are subject to compliance with multiple tax jurisdictions.\nAs we transact out of both the UK and United States we must comply with tax filing requirements in both jurisdictions.\nWe may not manage to implement changes to our control environment within the timeframes required\nWe have identified changes that we need to make to our control environment in order to move to SOX compliance. Whilst we have an action plan in place, it may not be possible for us to implement all of the changes required by the required date.", "PERMNO": 17269, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "NMRD"}
