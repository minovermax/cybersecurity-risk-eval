{"cik": "277135", "company": "GRAINGER W W INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to Grainger\u2019s business that could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which the Company is exposed.\nWeakness in the economy, market trends and other conditions affecting the profitability and financial stability of Grainger\u2019s customers could negatively impact Grainger\u2019s sales growth and results of operations.\nEconomic, political, and industry trends affect Grainger\u2019s business environments. Grainger serves several industries and markets in which the demand for its products and services is sensitive to the production activity, capital spending and demand for products and services of Grainger\u2019s customers. Many of these customers operate in markets that are subject to cyclical fluctuations resulting from market uncertainty, trade and tariff policies, costs of goods sold, currency exchange rates, central bank interest rate changes, foreign competition, offshoring of production, oil and natural gas prices, geopolitical developments, labor shortages, inflation, deflation, and a variety of other factors beyond Grainger\u2019s control. Any of these factors could cause customers to idle or close facilities, delay purchases, reduce production levels, or experience reductions in the demand for their own products or services.\nAny of these events could also reduce the volume of products and services these customers purchase from Grainger or impair the ability of Grainger\u2019s customers to make full and timely payments, and could cause increased pressure on Grainger\u2019s selling prices and terms of sale. Accordingly, a significant or prolonged slowdown in activity in the U.S., Canada or any other major world economy, or a segment of any such economy, could negatively impact Grainger\u2019s sales growth and results of operations.\nThe facilities maintenance industry is highly competitive, and changes in competition could result in decreased demand for Grainger\u2019s products and services.\nGrainger competes in a variety of ways, including product assortment and availability, services offered to customers, pricing, purchasing convenience, and the overall experience Grainger offers. This includes the ease of use of Grainger\u2019s high-touch high-service operations (branches and digital platforms) and delivery of products.\nThere are several large competitors in the industry, although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors. Grainger faces competition in all markets it serves, from manufacturers (including some of its own suppliers) that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, catalog houses, retail enterprises and online businesses that compete with price transparency.\nTo remain competitive, the Company must be willing and able to respond to market pressures. These pressures, and the implementation, timing and results of Grainger\u2019s strategic pricing and other responses, could have a material effect on Grainger\u2019s sales and profitability. If the Company is unable to grow sales or reduce costs, among other actions, to wholly or partially offset the effect on profitability of its pricing actions, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nMoreover, Grainger expects technological advancements and the increased use of eCommerce solutions within the industry to continue to evolve at a rapid pace. As a result, Grainger\u2019s ability to effectively compete requires Grainger to respond and adapt to new industry trends and developments, and implement new technology and innovations that may result in unexpected costs or may take longer than expected.\nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.\nSome of Grainger\u2019s products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives, or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs. Grainger\u2019s ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes.\nUnexpected product shortages, tariffs, and risks associated with Grainger\u2019s suppliers could negatively impact customer relationships or result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nGrainger\u2019s competitive strengths include product selection and availability. Products are purchased from approximately 5,000 suppliers located in various countries around the world, not one of which accounted for more than 5% of total purchases.\nHistorically, no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply; however, disruptions could occur due to factors beyond Grainger\u2019s control, including economic downturns, geopolitical unrest, new tariffs or tariff increases, trade issues and policies, labor problems experienced by Grainger\u2019s suppliers, transportation availability and cost, inflation and other factors, any of which could adversely affect a supplier\u2019s ability to manufacture or deliver products or could result in an increase in Grainger\u2019s product costs.\nFurther, Grainger sources products from Asia and other areas of the world. This increases the risk of supply disruption due to the additional lead time required and distances involved.\nIf Grainger was to experience difficulty in obtaining products, there could be a short-term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer-term adverse effect on customer relationships and Grainger\u2019s reputation. In addition, Grainger has strategic relationships with a number of vendors. In the event Grainger was unable to maintain those relations, there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could, in turn, adversely affect results of operations.\nChanges in customer base or product mix could cause changes in Grainger\u2019s gross margin or affect Grainger\u2019s competitive position.\nFrom time to time, Grainger experiences changes in customer base and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer base and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities and competition. There can be no assurance that Grainger will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.\nAdditionally, as customer base and product mix change over time, Grainger must identify new products, product lines and services that respond to industry trends and customer needs. The inability to introduce new products and effectively integrate them into Grainger\u2019s existing product mix could have a negative impact on future sales growth and Grainger\u2019s competitive position.\nDisruptions in Grainger\u2019s supply chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters such as earthquakes, storms, hurricanes, floods, fires, droughts, tornados and other extreme weather; geopolitical events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which Grainger operates or in which its suppliers are located; and the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade could result in disruption of Grainger\u2019s logistics or supply chain network. Any such disruption could cause one or more of Grainger\u2019s distribution centers or branches to become non-operational, adversely affect Grainger\u2019s ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair Grainger\u2019s ability to meet customer demand for products, result in lost sales, additional costs, or penalties, or damage Grainger\u2019s reputation. Grainger\u2019s ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of Grainger\u2019s business strategy and any such disruption could adversely impact results of operations and financial performance.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.\nThe proper functioning of Grainger\u2019s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business. Grainger continues to invest in software, hardware and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems. Although Grainger\u2019s information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power losses, telecommunication failures, user error, third party actions such as malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks and cybersecurity breaches, and other problems.\nIf Grainger\u2019s systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly Grainger may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them and may suffer interruptions in its business operations in the interim. If critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, among other things, Grainger\u2019s ability to process orders,\nmaintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, and disburse funds could be adversely affected. Any such interruption of Grainger\u2019s information systems could have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations.\nCybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, could damage Grainger\u2019s reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.\nThrough Grainger\u2019s sales and eCommerce channels, Grainger collects and stores personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary and other information from customers so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services, enroll in promotional programs, register on Grainger\u2019s websites or otherwise communicate or interact with the Company. Moreover, Grainger\u2019s operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, suppliers and employees, and other sensitive matters.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems.\nMoreover, from time to time, Grainger may share information with vendors and other third parties that assist with certain aspects of the business. While Grainger requires assurances that these vendors and other parties will protect confidential information, there is a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised. If successful, those attempting to penetrate Grainger\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 information systems may misappropriate personally identifiable, credit card, confidential, proprietary or other sensitive customer, supplier, employee or business information, or cause systems disruption.\nIn addition, a Grainger employee, contractor or other third party with whom Grainger does business may attempt to circumvent security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Further, Grainger\u2019s systems are integrated with customer systems in certain cases, and a breach of the Company\u2019s information systems could be used to gain illicit access to customer systems and information.\nWhile Grainger has instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, Grainger may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any breach of Grainger\u2019s security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of its third party service providers could cause Grainger to incur significant costs to protect any customers, suppliers, employees, and other parties whose personal data is compromised and to make changes to its information systems and administrative processes to address security issues. Loss of customer, supplier, employee or other business information could disrupt operations, damage Grainger\u2019s reputation and expose Grainger to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Grainger, its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the past, Grainger has experienced certain cybersecurity incidents. In each instance, Grainger provided notifications and adopted remedial measures. While these incidents have not been deemed to be material to Grainger, there can be no assurance that a future breach or incident would not be material to Grainger's operations and financial condition.\nGrainger\u2019s ability to adequately protect its intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims by others may have an adverse impact on operations.\nGrainger\u2019s business relies on the use, validity and continued protection of certain proprietary information and intellectual property, which includes current and future patents, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements as well as license and sublicense agreements to use intellectual property owned by affiliated entities or third parties. Unauthorized use of Grainger\u2019s intellectual property by others could result in harm to various aspects of the business and may result in costly and protracted litigation in order to protect its rights. In addition, Grainger may be subject to claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, which could subject Grainger to liability, require Grainger to obtain licenses to use those rights at significant cost or otherwise cause Grainger to modify its operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency could have an effect on reported results of operations.\nGrainger\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity\u2019s functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of Grainger\u2019s subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, Grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies of Grainger\u2019s international subsidiaries, primarily the Canadian dollar, euro, pound sterling, Mexican peso, renminbi and yen, arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries, sales to customers, purchases from suppliers, and bank loans and lines of credit denominated in foreign currencies. Grainger also has foreign currency exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary\u2019s functional currency and that could have an impact on sales, costs and cash flows. These fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect Grainger\u2019s results of operations and impact reported net sales and net earnings.\nAcquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures and other business combination transactions involve a number of inherent risks, any of which could result in the benefits anticipated not being realized and could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nAcquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures and other business combination transactions, both foreign and domestic, involve various inherent risks, such as uncertainties in assessing value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability. There is also risk relating to Grainger\u2019s ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from the transactions. Additionally, problems could arise from the integration of acquired businesses, including unanticipated changes in the business or industry or general economic or political conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition. Any one or more of these factors could cause Grainger to not realize the benefits anticipated or have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Accordingly, goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of acquisitions could, and have in the past, become impaired.\nIn order to compete, Grainger must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nIn order to compete and have continued growth, Grainger must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and support positions. Grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Grainger\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.\nGrainger\u2019s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Grainger\u2019s reputation.\nOne of the reasons why customers choose to do business with Grainger and why employees choose Grainger as a place of employment is the reputation that Grainger has built over many years. To be successful in the future, Grainger must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Grainger\u2019s brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Grainger\u2019s brand and lead to adverse effects on Grainger\u2019s business.\nGrainger is subject to various domestic and foreign laws, regulations and standards. Failure to comply or unforeseen developments in related contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect Grainger\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGrainger\u2019s business is subject to legislative, legal, and regulatory risks and conditions specific to the countries in which it operates. In addition to Grainger\u2019s U.S. operations, which in 2018 generated approximately 72% of its consolidated net sales, Grainger operates its business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, China, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and its majority-owned subsidiary in Japan.\nThe wide array of laws, regulations and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where Grainger operates, include, but are not limited to: advertising and marketing regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, anti-competition regulations, data protection (including, because Grainger accepts credit cards, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), data privacy (including in the U.S. and the European Union, which has traditionally imposed strict obligations\nunder data privacy laws and regulations that vary from country to country) and cybersecurity requirements (including protection of information and incident responses), environmental protection laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, government business regulations applicable to Grainger as a government contractor selling to federal, state and local government entities, health and safety laws, import and export requirements, intellectual property laws, labor laws (including federal and state wage and hour laws), product compliance laws, supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products, tax laws (including as to U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), unclaimed property laws and laws, regulations and standards applicable to other commercial matters. Moreover, Grainger is also subject to audits and inquiries in the normal course of business.\nFailure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and standards could result in civil, criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and/or loss of authorization to participate in, or exclusion from, government contracting, as well as potential damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. Changes in these laws, regulations and standards, or in their interpretation, could increase the cost of doing business, including, among other factors, as a result of increased investments in technology and the development of new operational processes. Furthermore, while Grainger has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations and standards, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, suppliers, vendors, or other third parties will not violate such laws, regulations and standards or Grainger\u2019s policies. Any such failure to comply or violation could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect Grainger\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, Grainger\u2019s business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws, resulting from the UK\u2019s anticipated exit from the European Union.\nGrainger also is, and from time to time may become, party to a number of legal proceedings incidental to Grainger\u2019s business involving alleged damages or injuries arising out of the use of Grainger\u2019s products and services or violations of these laws, regulations or standards. The defense of these proceedings may require significant expenses and divert management\u2019s time and attention, and Grainger may be required to pay damages that could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that Grainger may have with respect to such matters may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures.\nTax changes could affect Grainger\u2019s effective tax rate and future profitability.\nGrainger\u2019s future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in Grainger\u2019s overall profitability and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax legislation, the results of the examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessment of the Company\u2019s tax exposures.\nGrainger\u2019s common stock may be subject to volatility or price declines.\nThe trading price of Grainger\u2019s common stock is subject to broad and unpredictable fluctuation due to changes in economic, political and market conditions, the operating results of Grainger and its competitors, changes in expectations as to Grainger\u2019s future financial or operating performance, including estimates by securities analysts and investors, changes in capital structure, stock repurchase programs or dividend policies, and a number of other factors, including those discussed in this Item 1A. These factors, many which are outside of Grainger\u2019s control, could cause stock price volatility or Grainger\u2019s stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 52695, "SIC": 5000, "TIC": "GWW"}
