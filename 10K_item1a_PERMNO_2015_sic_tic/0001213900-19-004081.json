Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider all of the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this report, including the financial statements. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and you are encouraged to perform your own investigation with respect to us and our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately address these risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate, which could adversely affect our performance and financial results.\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for our products, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer confidence or preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\nIn addition, we rely on estimates and forecasts of our expenses and revenues to inform our business strategies, and our past estimates and forecasts have not been accurate. The rapidly evolving nature of the direct-to-consumer mattress industry and our business make forecasting operating results difficult. If we fail to accurately forecast our expenses and revenues, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may suffer, and the value of our business may decline. If our estimates and forecasts prove incorrect, we may not be able to adjust our operations quickly enough to respond to lower than expected sales or higher than expected expenses.\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following:\n\u25cf our ability to attract new customers and the cost of acquiring new customers;\n\u25cf our ability and the time required to develop new Mattress Max machines, develop new production lines, scale production capacity and appropriately train staff;\n\u25cf the success of our wholesale expansion efforts;\n\u25cf our ability to have enough production capacity to meet customer demand;\n\u25cf our ability to effectively manage increasing sales and marketing expenses;\n\u25cf our access to sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund the growth of our business;\n\u25cf competition from the sublicensees of intellectual property licensed back to EdiZONE, LLC;\n\u25cf our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, fulfill orders and manage product returns;\n\u25cf the introduction of competitive products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\n\u25cf timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\n\u25cf the success of our geographic and product line expansions, including but not limited to power requirements, labor needs, and ease of product distribution;\n\u25cf the success of hiring and expeditiously training engaged labor locally and worldwide;\n\u25cf our ability to secure and retain superior global partners for specialized delivery services;\n\u25cf the extent to which we use debt or equity financing, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\n\u25cf the outcomes of legal proceedings, claims, or governmental investigations or rulings, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;\n\u25cf the enforceability and validity of our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf our ability to accommodate variations in the mix of products we sell;\n\u25cf variations in our level of product returns, as well as our methods of collecting product returns or exchanges;\n\u25cf the extent to which we offer free shipping;\n\u25cf the extent to which we invest in technology and content, manufacturing, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\n\u25cf increases in the prices of materials used in the manufacturing of our products or the costs to produce our products, including but not limited to new or unanticipated tariffs;\n\u25cf our ability to anticipate and prepare for disruptions to manufacturing;\n\u25cf the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our websites successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;\n\u25cf our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\n\u25cf the extent to which our internal network or website is affected by denial of service attacks, malicious unauthorized access, outages, and similar events; and\n\u25cf the extent to which our internal network is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, intrusions, data theft, downtime, and similar events.\nWe have a short operating history in an evolving industry and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.\nWe are a rapidly growing business with a short operating history. Our relatively short operating history makes it difficult to assess our future performance. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, market acceptance of our products and services and future products and services, competition from new and established companies, including those with greater financial and technical resources, enhancing our products and services and developing new products and services.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred losses of $19.6 million and $8.8 million and had negative working capital of $0.9 million and $18.3 million, respectively. We experienced negative operating cash flow of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and as of December 31, 2018 our accumulated deficit was $4.3 million. We need positive cash flow from operations and additional capital to execute our business plan and growth initiatives. If we are unable to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource requirements our business could become adversely affected.\nYou should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter, as described above and elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nThe growth of our business places significant strain on our resources and if we are unable to manage our growth we may not have profitable operations or sufficient capital resources.\nWe are rapidly and significantly expanding our operations, including increasing our product offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support expansion of our manufacturing capacity and our wholesale channel expansion. Our planned growth includes increasing our manufacturing capacity, developing and introducing new products and developing new and broader distribution channels, including wholesale, and extending our global reach to other countries in the long-term. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions.\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage and expand our operations and facilities and production capacity in the face of continued growth. The growth in our operations has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the quality of our products and fulfillment capabilities suffer which could adversely affect our operating results. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. If we are unable to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource requirements, we may have to scale back, postpone or discontinue our growth strategies, which could result in slower growth or no growth, and we may run the risk of losing key suppliers, we may not be able to timely satisfy customer orders, and we may not be able to retain all of our employees. In addition, we may be forced to restructure our obligations to creditors or pursue work-out options.\nTo manage our growth effectively, we will need to continue to implement operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures and improve the systems and procedures that are currently in place. There is no assurance that we will be able to fulfill our staffing requirements for our business, successfully train and assimilate new employees, or expand our management base and enhance our operating and financial systems. Failure to achieve any of these goals will prevent us from managing our growth in an effective manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products offered by us, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Further, we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\nWhen recently rolling out our new mattress lines through our direct-to-consumer sales channel, we identified a need for internal controls to avoid delays in the timely delivery of our new mattress products and to improve the customer\u2019s experience. Also, we have been experiencing rapid growth in our employee base, and the need to implement controls and procedures for improving employee training and retention. Competition for employees where our production facilities are located also has increased the costs for employee retention. We are seeking to implement improved controls and procedures in an environment of continuous change and our use of resources may not be as effective as intended or we may need to apply additional resources than expected to make these changes to improve our employee retention and effectiveness and the quality of our products and services over time. If we are unable to make continuous improvement, resulting in reduction of operation expenses and improvement of our products and services, our business could continue to be adversely affected.\nWe will need additional capital to execute our business plan and fund operations and may not be able to obtain such capital on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn connection with the development and expansion of our business, we expect to incur significant capital and operational expenses. We believe that we can increase our sales and net income by implementing a growth strategy that focuses on (i) increasing our manufacturing capacity, (ii) increasing our direct-to-consumer sales; (iii) expanding our wholesale distribution channel, particularly for our mattress products; (iv) expanding our global sales; and (v) engaging global partners to improve distribution efficiencies and cost savings.\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of liquidity, including the additional cash we received on February 26, 2019 and may have access to under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmended and Restated Credit Agreement\u201d), by and among Purple LLC, Coliseum Capital Partners, L.P. (\u201cCCP\u201d), Blackwell Partners LLC-Series A (\u201cBlackwell\u201d), Coliseum Co-Invest Debt Fund, L.P. (\u201cCDF\u201d and, together with CCP and Blackwell, the \u201cLenders\u201d), will be sufficient to fund anticipated operating expenses, growth initiatives and our other anticipated liquidity needs for the next twelve months, based on our current operating conditions. Our ability to obtain other capital resources and sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to support future growth strategies. If we are unable to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource requirements, we may have to scale back, postpone or discontinue our growth strategies, which could result in slower growth or no growth, and we may run the risk of losing key suppliers, we may not be able to timely satisfy customer orders, and we may not be able to retain all of our employees. In addition, we may be forced to restructure our obligations to creditors, pursue work-out options or other protective measures.\nOur ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms or at all is subject to a variety of uncertainties. Adequate financing may not be available or, if available, may only be available on unfavorable terms. The restrictive covenants in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may make it difficult to obtain additional capital on terms that are favorable to us. There is no assurance we will obtain the capital we require. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fund our future operations or growth strategies. In addition, future equity or debt financings may require us to also issue warrants or other equity securities that are likely to be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Newly issued securities may include preferences or superior voting rights or be combined with the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which each may have additional dilutive effects. Furthermore, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition. If we cannot raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to carry out all or parts of our long-term growth strategy, maintain our growth and competitiveness or continue in business.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management, including but not limited to revenue recognition, estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities (including allowances for returns, credit card chargebacks, doubtful accounts), valuation of inventory, internal-use software and website development (acquired and developed internally), accounting for income taxes, valuation of intangible assets, equity-based compensation and loss contingencies. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company\u2019s 2017 financial statements were audited in connection with the Business Combination. As a result of this audit and in anticipation of becoming a public company, the Company implemented many accounting policies. The Company may determine in the future that these policies are not effective or appropriate for the Company. Moreover, the Company may determine that the assumptions it has relied on in preparing its financial statements are not appropriate. These determinations could lead to significant changes in the accounting policies of and assumptions used by the Company in the future, which could negatively impact your investment.\nFor example, during 2018, the Company identified immaterial errors that caused an overstatement in 2017 of previously reported net inventory and prepaid inventory. The error in net inventory related primarily to a process deficiency in the physical inventory count and reconciliation process that resulted in an overstatement of certain inventory items. The error in prepaid inventory related to the process deficiency in the tracking and reconciling of deposits made to overseas suppliers for inventory orders. The correction of these errors reduced net inventory and prepaid inventory by $2.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and increased cost of revenues in an amount of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The errors had no impact on net cash provided by operating activities. It is possible that additional errors could be identified as we continue to improve our controls and processes.\nOur future growth and profitability depend in part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line and to successfully execute new product introductions.\nAs described in greater detail below, the mattress, pillow and cushion industries are highly competitive, and our ability to compete effectively and to profitably grow our market share depends in part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our product line and related accessory products.\nWe incur significant research and development and other expenditures in the pursuit of improvements and additions to our product line. If these efforts do not result in meaningful product improvements or new product introductions, or if we are not able to gain widespread consumer acceptance of product improvements or new product introductions, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, if any significant product improvements or new product introductions are not successful, our reputation and brand image may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nA significant portion of our gross profit comes from our mattress products. If we are unable to develop new models of our mattress products or successfully market and sell new mattress models, our profitability may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nOur expansion into new products, market segments and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks.\nThe vast majority of our sales are made directly to consumers through our website or certain other e-commerce platforms. We have been expanding our business into the wholesale distribution channel through a relationship with our wholesale partners but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience success with our wholesale partners or that anticipated new retail locations will be successful.\nWe may be unsuccessful in generating sales through wholesale channels. We may extend credit terms in connection with such retail relationships and such retail relationships may expose us to the risk of unpaid or late paid invoices. In addition, we may provide fixtures to retail partners that may be difficult to recover. We have limited experience in the wholesale channel, and our wholesale customers may not purchase our products in the volume we expect.\nProfitability, if any, from sales to wholesale customers and new product offerings may be lower than from our direct-to-consumer model and current products, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of these issues were to arise, they could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe may be unsuccessful in opening any of our own Company retail stores beyond the current store we currently have in Alpine, Utah. We have limited experience in opening stores and operating our own brick-and-mortar retail business. Operating our own physical stores includes additional risks. For example, we will incur expenses and accept obligations related to additional leases, distribution and delivery challenges, increased employee management, and new marketing challenges. If we are not successful in our efforts to profitably operate these new stores, our reputation and brand could be damaged, growth could be limited, and our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, offerings of new products through our direct-to-consumer platform, wholesale distribution channel and possible future Company-owned stores may present new and difficult challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Expansion of sales channels may require the development of additional, differentiated products to avoid price and distribution conflicts between and within sales channels. Wholesale expansion increases our risk as our wholesale partners will require delaying payments to us on net terms ranging from a few days to 60 or more days.\nNew products may come with the same warranty and return risks as mentioned above. New product offerings or expansion into new market channels or geographic regions may subject us to new or additional regulation, which would impose potentially significant compliance and distribution costs.\nOur future growth and profitability depend upon the strength of our Purple brand and the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs and our ability to attract and retain customers.\nWe are highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing messages and the efficiency of our advertising expenditures in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products. We continue to evolve our marketing strategies, adjusting our messages, the amount we spend on advertising and where we spend it. We may not always be successful in developing effective messages and new marketing channels, as consumer preferences and competition change, and in achieving efficiency in our advertising expenditures.\nWe depend heavily on internet-based advertising to market our products through internet-based media and e-commerce platforms. If we are unable to continue utilizing such platforms, if those media and platforms diminish in importance or size, or if we are unable to direct our advertising to our target consumer groups, our advertising efforts may be ineffective, and our business could be adversely affected. The costs of advertising through these platforms have increased significantly, which has resulted in decreased efficiency in the use of our advertising expenditures, and we expect these costs may continue to increase in the future.\nWe have relationships with online services, search engines, affiliate marketing websites, directories and other website and e-commerce businesses to provide content, advertising and other links that direct customers to our website. We rely on these relationships as significant sources of traffic to our website and to generate new customers. If we are unable to develop or maintain these relationships or develop and maintain new relationships for newly developed and necessary marketing services on acceptable terms, our ability to attract new customers and our financial condition would suffer. In addition, current or future relationships or agreements may fail to produce the sales that we anticipate.\nThe cost of advertising for web-based platforms, such as Facebook, are increasing significantly. Increasing advertising costs erode the efficiency of our advertising efforts. If we are unable to effectively manage our advertising costs or if our advertising efforts fail to produce the sales that we anticipate, our business could be adversely affected.\nConsumers are increasingly using digital tools as a part of their shopping experience. As a result, our future growth and profitability will depend in part on (i) the effectiveness and efficiency of our online experience for disparate worldwide audiences, including advertising and search optimization programs in generating consumer awareness and sales of our products, (ii) our ability to prevent confusion among consumers that can result from search engines that allow competitors to use or bid on our trademarks to direct consumers to competitors\u2019 websites, (iii) our ability to prevent Internet publication or television broadcast of false or misleading information regarding our products or our competitors\u2019 products; (iv) the nature and tone of consumer sentiment published on various social media sites; and (v) the stability of our website. In recent periods, a number of direct-to-consumer, Internet-based retailers, like us, have emerged and have driven up the cost of basic search terms, which has and may continue to increase the cost of our Internet-based marketing programs. More recently, the large traditional mattress manufacturers have been increasing their efforts to increase their direct-to-consumer sales which also is increasing the cost of our Internet-based marketing programs and cost of customer conversion.\nIn the past, we have been the target of publications by purported consumer reviewers who claim to have identified health and safety concerns with our products. While we believe such claims to be baseless, refuting such claims requires us to expend significant resources to educate current and potential customers on the safety of our products. Even if we are able to broadly disseminate factual information to refute such claims and reinforce the safety of our products, such claims and attendant adverse publicity could persist and damage our reputation and brand value and result in lower sales.\nThe number of third-party review websites is increasing, and such reviews are becoming increasingly influential with consumers. Negative reviews from such sources may receive widespread attention from consumers, which could damage our reputation and brand value and result in lower sales. If we are unable to effectively manage relationships with such reviewers to promote accurate reviews of our products, reviewers may decline to review our products or may post reviews with misleading information, which could damage our reputation and make it more difficult for us to improve our brand value.\nIf our marketing messages are ineffective or our advertising expenditures, geographic price-points, and other marketing programs, including digital programs, are inefficient in creating awareness and consideration of our products and brand name and in driving consumer traffic to our website, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. In addition, if we are not effective in preventing the publication of confusing, false or misleading information regarding our brand or our products, or if there arises significant negative consumer sentiment on social media regarding our brand or our products, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nOur future growth and profitability depend, in part, upon our ability to achieve and maintain sufficient production capacity to meet customer demands.\nWe manufacture our mattresses using our proprietary and patented Mattress Max\u2122 machinery to make our Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u00ae cushioning material. Because of the unique features of our Mattress Max machines, new machines are not readily available and must be constructed. We also have experienced inefficiencies in sourcing of materials and production of finished products. We have taken steps to improve our processes and capabilities. But if we are unable to maintain our improvements and continue our improvement initiatives to increase efficiencies, we may not be able to keep up with demand which would harm our business. If we are unable to construct new Mattress Max machines and implement them into our production process in a timely manner, or if our existing Mattress Max machines are unable to function at the desired capacity, our production capacity may be constrained and our ability to respond to customer demand may be adversely impacted. This would negatively impact our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability.\nWe have engaged in significant related-party transactions with affiliates and owners that may give rise to conflicts of interest, result in losses to the Company or otherwise adversely affect our operations and the value of our business.\nWe have engaged in numerous related-party transactions involving controlling persons and officers of the Company, as well as with other entities affiliated with controlling persons. Several of these transactions were entered into prior to the Business Combination. For example, since 2010, we have leased our facilities in Alpine, Utah from TNT Holdings, LLC, which is owned by Tony Pearce and Terry Pearce. As the Company grows, and its needs change, the Company may need to negotiate a termination or modification of this lease. Tony and Terry Pearce, either personally or through one or more of their other entities, also have tangible property located in this facility that has not been clearly identified and separated from the Company\u2019s property, although we expect this tangible property to be either removed or identified and separated in 2019. Tony and Terry Pearce pay no rent or other compensation to the Company to store such property in our leased facility. While there is currently no dispute over the lease, and we do not anticipate a dispute, there could arise in the future a dispute between the Company and Tony and Terry Pearce over this lease for reasons not currently foreseeable.\nPrior to the Business Combination, we also entered into an Amended and Restated Confidential Assignment and License Back Agreement with EdiZONE, LLC, an entity beneficially owned and controlled by Tony Pearce and Terry Pearce through their ownership of TNT Holdings, pursuant to which EdiZONE transferred tangible and intellectual property to the Company and the Company licensed back to EdiZONE certain intellectual property previously licensed by EdiZONE to third parties prior to the Business Combination in order to enable EdiZONE to continue to meet certain pre-existing license obligations to those third parties. EdiZONE and the Pearces have agreed to not modify or extend these third-party licenses and to not enter new third-party licenses. These third parties include direct competitors to the Company that at the time of the Business Combination were not selling products through retail channels in which the Company was selling its products. One of these third parties is now a domestic competitor of the Company, as it now sells mattresses through some of the same retailers through which the Company also sells its products. This competitor\u2019s sales revenues are increasing, resulting in increasing royalties paid to EdiZONE from this licensee. Another third-party licensee may make it difficult for the Company to expand into certain geographic regions, such as the European Union. Casey McGarvey, our Chief Legal Officer, is also entitled to receive a small percent of such royalties from EdiZONE related to these third-party licenses, in accordance with a small investment made in EdiZONE years before the Business Combination. While the current license back to EdiZONE, as recently amended following the Business Combination, is much narrower than the license that existed at the time of the Business Combination, these third-party licenses, including licenses by EdiZONE to our competitors, may lead to conflicts of interest between the Company and the Company\u2019s insiders receiving royalties. At the time this agreement with EdiZONE was first entered into, Purple LLC had only Tony and Terry Pearce as directors. Subsequent to the Business Combination, the license to EdiZONE was amended to broaden the Company\u2019s rights and narrow EdiZONE\u2019s rights with the approval of the Company\u2019s independent directors.\nPrior to the Business Combination, the Company also entered into a Shared Services Agreement with other entities controlled by Tony Pearce and Terry Pearce, including EdiZONE, which covers the provision of services to these entities by employees of the Company. We believe the terms of this agreement are based on reasonable arms\u2019 length terms. However, because Tony Pearce and Terry Pearce were the only directors of Purple LLC prior to the Business Combination, such transactions were not required to be approved by disinterested directors of the Company prior to the Business Combination. Also, the exercise of rights under this agreement for services to be performed by the Company may create conflicts of interest between the Company and the Pearce\u2019s. Only immaterial amounts of legal and accounting services were provided by Purple LLC in 2018.\nPrior to the Business Combination, InnoHold, LLC (\u201cInnoHold\u201d), an entity owned by Terry and Tony Pearce and the controlling stockholder of the Company, also granted equity incentive awards in Purple LLC to certain key employees. As a result of the structure of those awards being granted through a separate entity, the equity incentives were required, because of the structure of the Business Combination, to be exchanged for ownership units in InnoHold, to avoid those equity interests becoming of no value to the participants. Those participant\u2019s ownership interests have certain restrictions, including vesting requirements. These equity incentives granted to key employees prior to the Business Combination are forfeited to the extent the grant to an employee is not yet fully vested at the time that employee\u2019s employment is terminated. Before and since the Business Combination, all forfeitures occurring from departing employees have inured to the benefit of only the owners of InnoHold, and not all the Company\u2019s stockholders. This means that the forfeited equity does not increase the Company\u2019s currently approved equity incentive pool. This pertains to but is not limited to the forfeitures resulting from the departures occurring after the Business Combination in 2018, including that of the former Chief Executive Officer, Sam Bernards, and more recently the departures of the Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Brand Officer. Because the forfeited equity resulting from these departures prior to this distribution is held at InnoHold, that forfeited equity does not replenish the Company\u2019s equity incentive pool and cannot be used for current and future equity grants to those who have replaced and will replace these employees or for other purposes essential to the business. To avoid future forfeitures from inuring only to the benefit of InnoHold\u2019s owners, InnoHold has agreed to distribute to the incentive participants their pro rata share of InnoHold\u2019s ownership of Class B Common Stock in Purple Inc and Class B Units in Purple LLC, after which any forfeitures will inure to the benefit of all stockholders of the Company. The Company\u2019s current equity incentive pool, as approved by the stockholders prior to the Business Combination in the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, did not account for the departure of such key employees who had existing equity grants through InnoHold, and there is a risk that the Company will have to seek approval from the board and stockholders to refresh the equity incentive pool earlier than anticipated at the time of the Business Combination because of the unanticipated need to use shares from the existing pool to hire and retain replacements for the prior CEO, CMO and CBO and others. If the equity pool is not refreshed, there is a risk that the Company may not be able to hire and retain these and other key employees. If the equity pool is refreshed with authorized shares of the Company that are issued in accordance with the Company\u2019s 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company\u2019s stockholders will be diluted.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, Purple LLC also entered into a Credit Agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with the Lenders which was guaranteed by Purple Inc. The Lenders also are stockholders and warrant holders of the Company and appointed one director to serve on the Company\u2019s board, Adam Gray. Further, on February 26, 2019, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement between Purple LLC and the Lenders thereto, and each of the related documents, including the issuance of additional warrants to the Lenders, was closed and an incremental loan was funded. The exercise of rights under this Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by the Lenders may create conflicts of interest between the Company and Mr. Gray.\nSee \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d for a further discussion of all related-party transactions between the Company and insiders.\nDisruption of operations in either of our two main manufacturing facilities, including as a result of natural disasters, could increase our costs of doing business or lead to delays in shipping our beds.\nWe have two main manufacturing plants, which are located in Alpine, Utah and Grantsville, Utah. A significant percentage of our products are assembled to fulfill orders rather than stocking finished goods inventory in our plants. Although we could produce our products at both sites, we are consolidating production of certain products at one site. Therefore, the disruption of operations of our manufacturing facilities, particularly the facility where manufacturing will be consolidated, for a significant period of time, or even permanently, such as through the loss of the lease, may increase our costs of doing business and lead to delays in shipping our products to customers. Such delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Because both of our manufacturing plants are located within the same geographic region, regional economic downturns, natural disasters or other issues could potentially disrupt all of our manufacturing and other operating activities, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to successfully anticipate consumer trends and demand and our failure to do so may lead to loss of consumer acceptance of the products we sell, resulting in reduced net sales.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing trends and consumer demands in a timely manner. Changes in consumers\u2019 tastes and trends and the resultant change in our product mix, as well as failure to offer our consumers multiple avenues for purchasing our products, could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to identify and respond to emerging trends, consumer acceptance of the products we manufacture and sell and our image with current or potential customers may be harmed, which could reduce our net sales. If we misjudge market trends, we may significantly overstock inventory and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit and cash flow. Conversely, shortages of inventory or time to fulfillment of our products that prove popular could also reduce our sales.\nWe have in some instances kept excessive amounts of raw material inventory and some finished goods inventory, which could be susceptible to shrinkage that may harm our ability to use or sell such inventory and may adversely impact our profitability.\nAlthough we attempt to maintain only the necessary amounts of raw material inventory on hand, in some instances we have accumulated excessive amounts of raw materials inventory. We also have accumulated excessive amounts of some finished goods inventory. All such excessive inventory is subject to shrinkage from destruction, theft, obsolescence and factors that render such inventory unusable or unsellable, and we have lost inventory for such reasons. While we take efforts to right-size all raw materials and finished goods inventory, if our efforts are not successful, we could continue to experience excessive amounts of some items of raw materials and finished goods and related shrinkage that could adversely impact our cash flow, margins and profitability.\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product quality could negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur products are highly differentiated from traditional mattresses, sheets, pillows and cushions. As a result, our products may be susceptible to failures that do not exist with traditional products. Failure to achieve and maintain acceptable quality standards could impact consumer acceptance of our products or could result in negative media and Internet reports or owner dissatisfaction that could negatively impact our brand image and sales levels.\nIn addition, a decline in product quality could result in an increase in return rates and a corresponding decrease in sales, or an increase in product warranty claims in excess of our warranty reserves. An unexpected increase in return rates or warranty claims could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe currently maintain FDA registrations on a select group of our cushions that are sold through third parties. These FDA registrations allow for FDA inspections and there is a risk that an FDA inspection could lead to product recall of the FDA registered cushions. The number of products is small; however, a recall can result, among other things, in lost sales, diverted resources and potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAs a consumer innovation company with differentiated products, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in personal injury or property damage. If any of our products proves to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such products. Such recalls of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe maintain insurance against some forms of product liability claims, but such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, may have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are subject to warranty claims for our products, which could result in unexpected expense.\nOur products carry warranties for defects in quality and workmanship. Historically, the amount for return of products, discounts provided to affected customers and cost for returns or warrant claims has been immaterial. However, we may experience significant expense as the result of future product quality issues, product recalls or product liability claims which may have a material adverse effect on our business. The actual costs of servicing future warranty claims may exceed our expectations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSignificant product returns could harm our business.\nWe allow our customers to return products, subject to our returns policies. If product returns are higher than we anticipate, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Further, we modify our policies and procedures relating to returns from time to time, and policies and methods of collecting returned products intended to reduce the number of product returns may result in customer dissatisfaction. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have experienced an increase in returns above previously anticipated levels. This increase has negatively impacted our business and profitability. If we are unable to identify correctly the causes of these increased returns or to counteract those causes, we may not be able to lower returns or prevent the rate of returns from increasing, which would continue to negatively impact our business and profitability.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of business could affect our operations and financial condition.\nIn the normal course of business, we may from time to time become involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of such matters could cause us to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations. Any significant adverse litigation, judgments or settlements could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending against such litigation, the costs of making such a defense, which may or may not be covered by our insurance, could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and other business relationships.\nTo successfully operate our business, we rely on commercial agreements and strategic relationships with suppliers, service providers and certain wholesale partners and customers. These arrangements can be complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments. Further, our business partners may have disruptions in their businesses or choose to no longer do business with us. We may not be able to implement, maintain, or develop the components of these commercial relationships. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms or at all.\nAs our agreements terminate or relationships unwind, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur present and future services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic relationships create additional risks such as:\n\u25cf disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\u25cf impairment of other relationships;\n\u25cf variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\n\u25cf difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\nDuring 2018 we entered into arrangements with several new wholesale partners through which we sell certain of our products in their retail stores. We anticipate increasing the number of these partnerships. Our relationships with our wholesale partners may not be profitable to us or may impose additional costs that we would not otherwise incur under our prior DTC-only operations. Our wholesale partners may experience their own business disruptions, including for example bankruptcy, that could affect their ability to continue to do business with the Company. Further, maintaining these relationships may require the commitment of significant amounts of time, financial resources and management attention, and may result in prohibitions on certain sales channels through exclusivity requirements, which may adversely affect other aspects of our business.\nCurrent and future economic conditions could materially adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business has been affected by general business and economic conditions, and these conditions could have an impact on future demand for our products. The global economy remains unstable, and we expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging.\nOur sales depend, in part, on discretionary spending by our customers. Pressure on discretionary income brought on by general economic downturns and slow recoveries may cause consumers to reduce the amount they spend on discretionary items. If recovery from any economic downturn is slow or prolonged, our growth, prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nGeneral economic conditions and discretionary spending are beyond our control and are affected by, among other things, reduced consumer demand for products; insolvency of potential customers; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of consumers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; decreased consumer confidence; and inability for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends. If such conditions are experienced in future periods, our industry, business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe operate in the highly competitive mattress, pillow and cushion industries, and if we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose customers and our sales may decline.\nThe mattress, pillow and cushion markets are highly competitive and fragmented. We face competition from many manufacturers (including competitors that primarily manufacture and import from China), traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers, including direct-to-consumer competitors. Participants in the mattress, pillow and cushion industries compete primarily on price, quality, brand name recognition, product availability and product performance and compete across a range of distribution channels. The highly competitive nature of the mattress, pillow and cushion industries means we are continually subject to the risk of loss of market share, loss of significant customers, reductions in margins, and the inability to acquire new customers.\nA number of our significant competitors offer products that compete directly with our products. Any such competition by established manufacturers and retailers or new entrants into the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Mattress, pillow and cushion manufacturers and retailers are seeking to increase their channels of distribution and are looking for new ways to reach the consumer. Like us, many newer competitors in the mattress industry have begun to offer \u201cbed-in-a-box\u201d or similar products directly to consumers through the Internet and other distribution channels. Some of our established competitors have begun to offer \u201cbed-in-a-box\u201d products as well. Companies providing for the distribution of mattresses online or through retail stores, such as Amazon and Walmart, also have begun to offer competing products in their respective channels. In addition, retailers outside the U.S. have integrated vertically in the furniture and bedding industries, and it is possible that retailers may acquire other retailers or may seek to vertically integrate in the U.S. by acquiring a mattress manufacturer.\nMany of our current and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial support, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, mature distribution methods, and more established relationships in the industry than we do and sell products through broader and more established distribution channels. These competitors, or new entrants into the market, may compete aggressively and gain market share with existing or new products, and may pursue or expand their presence in the mattress, pillow and cushion industries. We cannot be sure we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future. We have limited ability to anticipate the timing and scale of new product introductions, advertising campaigns or new pricing strategies by our competitors, which could inhibit our ability to retain or increase market share, or to maintain our product margins. Our current and potential competitors may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Also, due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings, we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products through value, styling or functionality from those of our competitors. Our products are also typically heavier than others and some markets we wish to expand into will not support delivery of our heavy products through parcel services or other affordable home delivery services, limiting our ability to serve the market.\nOne competitor, which has been a licensee of EdiZONE for over fifteen years, uses substantially similar technology to the Company\u2019s Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u00ae material in its own mattress, topper and pillow products sold through branded retail stores domestically and in Canada. This competitor recently has been seen to be growing its sales and now distributes its products through wholesale partners with retail locations where the Company\u2019s mattresses are sold. This competitor may continue to increase its sales and expand into additional distribution channels which could erode the Company\u2019s sales in those retail locations and channels. The continuing growth of this single competitor could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the barriers to entry into the retail bedding industry are relatively low. New or existing bedding retailers could enter our markets and increase the competition we face. Competition in existing and new markets may also prevent or delay our ability to gain relative market share. Any of the developments described above could have a material adverse effect on our planned growth and future results of operations.\nMoreover, the U.S. Department of Commerce has opened an antidumping investigation into whether mattresses imported from China are being sold into the United States at below fair market value. The investigation results from a petition filed by U.S. mattress manufacturers claiming that in recent years Chinese exporters have unfairly made large gains in market share by undercutting prices. The United States International Trade Commission has found that there is a reasonable indication that the U.S. mattress industry is being materially injured by reason of mattresses being imported from China and sold for less than fair value. The U.S. Department of Commerce will continue with its antidumping duty investigation concerning imports of this product from China. If the antidumping investigation does not result in the prevention of dumping of underpriced Chinese mattresses into the U.S. market, we could continue to experience a negative impact on our planned growth and the future results of operations.\nWe will face different market dynamics and competition as we develop new products to expand our presence in our target markets. In some markets, our future competitors may have greater brand recognition and broader distribution than we currently enjoy. We may not be as successful as our competitors in generating revenues in those markets due to the lack of recognition of our brands, lack of customer acceptance, lack of product quality history and other factors. As a result, any new expansion efforts could be costlier and less profitable than our efforts in our existing markets. If we are not as successful as our competitors are in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could be impacted negatively and we could lose market share, any of which could materially harm our business.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete with other manufacturers and retailers of mattresses, pillows and cushions, our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to protect our product designs and other proprietary rights adequately, which could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce the value of our products and brands, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly.\nWe attempt to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative brands, product designs and functionality and materials for use in our products. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements and license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights.\nWe own various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to certain elements of the design and function of our mattresses, pillows, cushions and related products, as well as related to proprietary formulas and related technology for certain materials used in the manufacturing of our products. We own numerous registered and unregistered trademarks and trademark applications, as well as other intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, trade dress and copyrights, which we believe have significant value and are important to the marketing of our products. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and protect our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties.\nDespite our efforts, we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Effective protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in the jurisdictions in which we do business. We also may be unable to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all jurisdictions in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nThe protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Litigation might be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, which may be costly and may divert our management\u2019s attention away from our core business. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that litigation would result in an outcome favorable to us. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, it would have a negative impact on our operations.\nWe, or the owners of any intellectual property rights licensed to us, may be subject to claims that we or such licensors have infringed the proprietary rights of others, which could require us and our licensors to obtain a license or change designs.\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although we do not believe any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of others, there is no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or those from whom we have licenses or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be asserted successfully, defending against such claims could cause us to incur costs and could divert resources away from our other activities. In addition, assertion of infringement claims could result in injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products. If any claims or actions are asserted against us or those from whom we have licenses, we may seek to obtain a license to the intellectual property rights that are in dispute. Such a license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, which could force us to change our designs.\nPurple LLC has licensed certain intellectual property to EdiZONE, LLC, which is owned by Tony and Terry Pearce via TNT Holdings, LLC, for the purpose of enabling EdiZONE to meet its contractual obligations to licensees of EdiZONE under contracts entered into years before the Business Combination, and some of those licensees are competitors of Purple LLC and have exclusivity rights that Purple LLC is required to observe.\nPurple LLC has licensed to EdiZONE, LLC, which is an entity owned by Tony and Terry Pearce through TNT Holdings, LLC, certain intellectual property rights for use by EdiZONE outside of the consumer comfort market. Prior to the Business Combination, EdiZONE\u2019s business model was the creation and licensing of intellectual priority, and it had granted many licenses over time, most of which were terminated prior to the Business Combination. When EdiZONE assigned its intellectual property to Purple LLC it received in return a license back of the intellectual property it needed to maintain its contractual obligations under the licenses that still were in place at that time. After the Business Combination, this license back to EdiZONE has been amended with the cooperation of Purple LLC, EdiZONE and the Pearces to further narrow EdiZONE\u2019s rights, in order to minimize the conflicts of interest that may exist. Although there are no conflicts of interest foreseen at this time, if conflicts of interest do arise and are not properly addressed, disputes may occur which may be detrimental to the Company.\nEdiZONE previously entered into licenses, as described above, for comfort-related intellectual property. These licenses include exclusivity rights that may prohibit us from selling our existing mattresses or potentially new products in certain geographic areas, including domestically and in the European Union. That risk may be addressed by redesign of the configuration of the Hyper-Elastic Polymer in that geographic region by either using existing technologies already assigned by EdiZONE to Purple LLC or developing new technologies. Alternatively, that risk may not exist at all to the extent Purple LLC\u2019s current mattress products are the subject of expired patent rights licensed by that licensee or because Purple LLC is not the licensor. However, there can be no assurance that our future sales in these geographic territories, if any, will not be challenged by the licensee as a violation of the license agreements, or that any redesigned mattresses created by us will be successful. If Purple LLC\u2019s activities are challenged by a licensee, Purple LLC has an indemnification obligation to EdiZONE and the Pearces, which may be an expense to the Company.\nIn addition, if these third parties violate their licenses or infringe on intellectual property owned by Purple LLC and Purple LLC is unable to take effective action against such violating or infringing parties, we may be unable to protect against this infringement or the effects of such violations and our business could be harmed.\nPurple LLC has obtained, with the cooperation of EdiZONE and the Pearces, the right to enforce its intellectual property rights at Purple LLC\u2019s option, contingent on Purple LLC\u2019s agreement to indemnify EdiZONE and fund the expense of such enforcement. In the event such enforcement is deemed necessary by Purple LLC, Purple LLC may not be able to enforce its rights and may not be successful in any such efforts to enforce its intellectual property rights and this may harm our business.\nSubstantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in e-commerce may harm our business.\nConsumers who might purchase our products from us online have a wide variety of alternatives for purchasing competing mattresses, pillows and cushions, including traditional brick and mortar retailers (as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers), other online direct-to-consumer retailers and their related mobile offerings, online and offline classified services, online retailer platforms, such as Amazon.com, and other shopping channels, such as offline and online home shopping networks.\nThe Internet and mobile networks provide new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods and services, including products that compete directly with our products. Consumers who purchase mattresses, pillows and cushions through us have more and more alternatives, and merchants have more online channels to reach consumers. We expect competition to continue to intensify. Online and offline businesses increasingly are competing with each other and our competitors include a number of online and offline retailers with significant resources, large user communities and well-established brands. Moreover, the barriers to entry into these channels can be low, and businesses easily can launch online sites or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful e-commerce companies. As we respond to changes in the competitive environment, we may, from time to time, make pricing, service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among our customers, which could reduce activity on our platform and harm our profitability.\nIn addition, sellers in our industry are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels, including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search-related advertisements on horizontal search engine sites, such as Google, Yahoo!, Naver and Baidu. We use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites, but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations. Consumers may choose to search for products with a horizontal search engine or shopping comparison website, and such sites may also send users to other shopping destinations. Consumers may not be familiar with or confused by our current web address: purple.com.\nWe also face increased competitive pressure as the competitive norm for, and the expected level of service from, e-commerce has significantly increased, due to, among other factors, improved user experience, greater ease of buying goods, lower (or no) shipping costs, faster delivery times and more favorable return policies. Also, certain platform businesses, many of whom are larger than us or have greater capitalization, have a dominant and secure position in other industries or certain significant markets, and offer a broader variety of mattress, pillow and cushion products to consumers and retailers that we do not offer. If we are unable to change our product offerings in ways that reflect the changing demands of e-commerce and mobile commerce marketplaces, particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed-price items and higher expected service levels, or compete effectively with and adapt to changes in larger platform businesses, our business will suffer.\nSome of our e-commerce competitors offer a significantly broader range of products and services than we do. Competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to website, mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can. Other direct-to-consumer retailers and e-commerce competitors may offer or continue to offer faster shipping, free shipping, delivery on Sunday, same-day delivery, favorable return policies or other transaction-related services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for us to match. Competitors may be able to innovate faster and more efficiently, and new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling competitors to offer more efficient or lower-cost services.\nWe have experienced substantial difficulties with timely and accurate delivery of products which has taken more time than anticipated to correct. We believe this is a result of internal deficiencies as well as deficiencies of our third-party white glove delivery service providers, and our efforts to correct these deficiencies is ongoing. If we are unable to correct our internal deficiencies and obtain an increased level of service from our third-party delivery vendors, we may suffer lost sales, damage to our reputation and liabilities to customers that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative programs, products and services, the use of our products and our revenues could decline.\nRapid, significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, resistance to change from clients or merchants, or third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards.\nA reduction in the availability of credit to consumers generally or under our existing consumer credit programs could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe offer financing to consumers through third-party consumer finance companies. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 28% of our sales were financed through third-party consumer finance companies. The amount of credit available to consumers may be adversely impacted by macroeconomic factors that affect the financial position of consumers as suppliers of credit adjust their lending criteria. In addition, changes in federal regulations effective in 2010 placed additional restrictions on all consumer credit programs, including limiting the types of promotional credit offerings that may be offered to consumers.\nThese third-party consumer finance companies offer consumer financing options to our customers through agreements that may be terminated by us or the companies upon thirty days\u2019 prior written notice. These consumer finance companies have discretion to control the content of financing offers to our customers and to set minimum credit standards under which credit is extended to customers.\nReduction of credit availability due to changing economic conditions, changes in regulatory requirements, or the termination of our agreements with third-party consumer finance companies could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe attempt to maintain only the necessary amounts of raw material inventory, which could leave us vulnerable to shortages in supply of components that may harm our ability to satisfy consumer demand and may adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nWe attempt to maintain only the necessary amounts of raw material inventory on hand, which could leave us vulnerable to shortages in supply of components that may harm our ability to satisfy consumer demand and may adversely impact our sales and profitability. Lead times for ordered components may vary significantly, especially as we source some of our materials from China. In addition, some components used to manufacture our products are provided on a sole source basis. Any unexpected shortage of materials caused by any disruption of supply or an unexpected increase in the demand for our products, could lead to delays in shipping our beds to customers. Any such delays could adversely affect our sales, customer satisfaction, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe rely upon several key suppliers that are, in some instances, the only source of supply currently used by us for particular materials, components or services. A disruption in the supply or substantial increase in cost of any of these products or services could harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe currently obtain all of the raw materials and components used to produce our mattresses, pillows and cushions from outside sources. In some cases, we have chosen to obtain these materials and components from suppliers who serve as the only source of supply, or who supply the vast majority of our needs of the particular material or component. While we believe that these materials and components, or suitable replacements, could be obtained from other sources, in the event of a disruption or loss of supply of relevant materials or components for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative sources of supply, or if found, may not be found on comparable terms. In addition, a change in the financial condition of some of our suppliers could impede their ability to provide products to us in a timely manner. Further, we maintain relatively small supplies of our raw materials and outsourced goods at our manufacturing facilities, and any disruption in the on-going shipment of supplies to us could interrupt production of our products, which could result in a decrease of our sales or could cause an increase in our cost of sales, either of which could decrease our liquidity and profitability.\nIf our relationship with the primary supplier of our mineral oil is terminated, we could have short-term difficulty in replacing these sources since there are relatively few other suppliers presently capable of supplying the local volume that we would need in a short period of time.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could cause delays that could result in our inability to provide goods to our customers or could increase our costs, either of which could decrease our earnings.\nIn manufacturing products, we use various commodity components, such as polyurethane foam, oil, our spring units, ingredients for our Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u00ae material, our water-based adhesive and other raw materials. Because we are dependent on outside suppliers for our raw materials, fluctuations in their price, availability, and quality could have a negative effect on our cost of sales and our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands. Competitive and marketing pressures may prevent us from passing along price increases to our customers, and the inability to meet our customers\u2019 demands could cause us to lose sales.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to provide timely delivery to our customers, and any disruption in our delivery capabilities or our related planning and control processes may adversely affect our operating results.\nAn important part of our success is due to our ability to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner. This in turn is due to our successful planning and distribution infrastructure, including ordering, transportation and receipt processing, the ability of our suppliers to meet our distribution requirements and the ability of our contractors to meet our delivery requirements. Our ability to maintain this success depends on the continued identification and implementation of improvements to our planning processes, distribution infrastructure and supply chain. We also need to ensure that our distribution infrastructure and supply chain keep pace with our anticipated growth and increased product output. The cost of these enhanced processes could be significant and any failure to maintain, grow or improve them could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on FedEx and other carriers to deliver our products to customers on a timely, convenient, and cost-effective basis. We also rely on the systems of such carriers to provide us with accurate information about the status and delivery of our products. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns and cause us to lose sales. Any increase in freight charges could increase our costs of doing business and harm our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Lack of accurate information from such carriers could damage our brand and our relationship with our customers.\nOur business could also be adversely affected if there are delays in product shipments to us due to freight difficulties, delays in product shipments clearing U.S. Customs for reasons of non-compliance or otherwise, challenges with our suppliers or contractors involving strikes or other difficulties at their principal transport providers or otherwise. Such delays could adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\nWe have experienced delays in the timely delivery of our mattress products. These delays have caused customer dissatisfaction with their experience with the Company and, in some cases, customers have cancelled their orders or returned their mattresses. We are working to rectify these delays with both internal operating and customer service controls and assistance offered to our third-party delivery providers. We have contracted with new delivery providers and are also seeking to qualify other delivery providers who can meet our standards. If we are unable to improve the timely delivery of our new mattress models, our business could continue to be adversely affected.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are disrupted by natural disasters or other catastrophes or if we are unable to protect the integrity and security of our information systems.\nWe depend largely upon our information technology systems in the conduct of all aspects of our operations. If our information technology systems fail to perform as anticipated, we could experience difficulties in virtually any area of our operations, including but not limited to receiving orders from customers, replenishing inventories or delivering our products. We may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in the pursuit of improvements or upgrades to our management information systems. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, and may cause short-term disruptions to our existing systems and our business. If we experience difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or experience significant system failures, or if we are unable to successfully modify our information systems to respond to changes in our business needs, our ability to run our business could be adversely affected. It is also possible that our competitors could develop better e-commerce platforms than ours, which could negatively impact our sales.\nIn addition, our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation due to hardware and software defects or malfunctions, computer denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, or other events. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, information hijacking or ransom, and intentional acts of vandalism. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. Any of these or other systems related problems could, in turn, adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nOur business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive employee, customer and consumer data, or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect such data.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store certain personal information from individuals, such as our customers and suppliers, and we process customer payment card and check information for purchases via our website. Cyber-attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching security systems of large organizations leading to unauthorized release of confidential information have occurred recently at a number of major U.S. companies despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and, if successful, misappropriate personal information, payment card or check information or confidential Company business information. In addition, a Company employee, contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information.\nWe will likely be subject to attempts to breach the security of our networks and IT infrastructure through cyber-attack, malware, computer viruses, and other means of unauthorized access. To the best of our knowledge, attempts to breach our systems have not been successful to date. A breach of our systems that resulted in the unauthorized release of sensitive data could adversely affect our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability, possibly including punitive damages. An electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against these risks. We continue to balance the additional risk with the cost to protect us against a breach. Additionally, losses arising from a breach could be covered in part by insurance that we carry.\nWe are subject to payments-related risks.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer\u2019s bank account, electronic payments (e.g., PayPal and Venmo), consumer invoicing and physical bank check. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products). For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, electronic fund transfers, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. In addition, our business and profitability could be adversely affected if customers who finance purchases fail to make financing payments in a timely manner.\nOur customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us. We are subject to the policies, procedures and rules of credit card issuers and payment card processors. We are completely dependent upon our payment card processors to process the sales transactions and remit the proceeds to us. The payment card processors have the right to withhold funds otherwise payable to us to establish or increase reserves based on their assessment of the inherent risks of payment card processing and their assessment of the risks of processing our customers\u2019 payment cards at any time, and have done so from time to time in the past. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with any of these policies, procedures, rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, events affecting our payment card processors, including cyber-attacks, Internet or other infrastructure or communications impairment or other events that could interrupt the normal operation of the payment card processors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCredit card fraud and our response to it could adversely affect our business.\nWe have received and anticipate we will continue to receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions it could reduce our net revenues and our gross profit or cause credit card or payment system companies to disallow their cards\u2019 use for customer payments on our website. We may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder\u2019s signature. If we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud, claims against us for these transactions could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nFurther, to the extent that our efforts to prevent fraudulent orders result in our inadvertent refusal to fill legitimate orders, we would lose the benefit of legitimate potential sales and risk the alienation of legitimate customers. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are at risk of fraudulent returns.\nWe believe some customers have processed a return of their purchased mattress products, and received a refund of the purchase price, fraudulently. If we fail to detect and prevent these fraudulent activities, we will suffer losses that would adversely affect our profitability. Also, our efforts to monitor and prevent fraud committed by customers could alienate legitimate customers which also could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on a few key employees, and if we lose the services of certain of our principal executive officers, we may not be able to run our business effectively.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key executive, merchandising, marketing, sales, finance, operations and engineering personnel. If any of our executive officers cease to be employed by us, we would have to hire additional qualified personnel. Our ability to successfully attract and hire other experienced and qualified executive officers cannot be assured and may be difficult because we face competition for these professionals from our competitors, our suppliers and other companies operating in our industry. Since the Business Combination, we have hired a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. The Company has also experienced the departure of the Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Branding Officer as well as announced the departure of the Chief Financial Officer. These departures and any delay in replacing these executives could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to grow and pursue its strategic plans. The Company is currently in the process of searching for qualified replacements. While we believe our new executive officers have benefitted and will continue to benefit the Company, finding qualified replacements is time-consuming, takes Company resources, and can disrupt the Company\u2019s growth and achievement of strategic plans.\nFurther, the involvement of Tony and Terry Pearce has been crucial to the success of our company because of their extensive experience with and technical knowledge of our products. Pursuant to the employment agreements that have been entered into with them in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, they are not required to work a particular number of hours for us or to be based at any particular location. The loss or reduction of their services could adversely affect our operations and our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nOur business exposes us to personal injury, property damage and product liability claims, which could result in adverse publicity and harm to our brands and our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to personal injury, property damage and product liability claims for the products that we sell. Any personal injury, property damage or product liability claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend, resulting in adverse publicity, or damage to our reputation, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, any negative publicity involving our vendors, employees, labor contractors, delivery contractors and other parties who are not within our control could negatively impact us.\nFurther, the products we sell are subject to regulation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (\u201cCPSC\u201d) and similar state and international regulatory authorities. Such products could be subject to recalls and other actions by these authorities. Product safety concerns may require us to voluntarily remove selected products from our stores. Such recalls and voluntary removal of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have received notice from the CPSC of several purported consumer complaints regarding some of our products. While we believe such complaints to be baseless, in terms of the alleged harms and, in some cases, the individual\u2019s actual use of our product, we are required to devote significant amounts of time, attention and other resources, including financial resources, to investigating and responding to such complaints. Further, because the complaints are available to the public, such complaints could result in adverse publicity or damage to our reputation and brand value and result in lower sales.\nWe maintain insurance against some forms of personal injury, property damage and product liability claims, but such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage, or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity against us, may have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nRegulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, trade, customs, environmental, health and safety requirements, may require costly expenditures and expose us to liability.\nOur products and our marketing and advertising programs are subject to regulation in the U.S. by various federal, state and local regulatory authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In addition, our operations are subject to federal, state and local consumer protection regulations and other laws relating specifically to the bedding industry. These rules and regulations may change from time to time or may conflict. There may be continuing costs of regulatory compliance including continuous testing, additional quality control processes and appropriate auditing of design and process compliance. For example, the CPSC and other jurisdictions have adopted rules relating to fire retardancy standards for the mattress industry. Some states and the U.S. Congress continue to consider fire retardancy regulations that may be different from or more stringent than the current standard. Additionally, California, Rhode Island and Connecticut have all enacted laws requiring the recycling of mattresses discarded in their states. State and local bedding industry regulations vary among the states in which we operate but generally impose requirements as to the proper labeling of bedding merchandise, restrictions regarding the identification of merchandise as \u201cnew\u201d or otherwise, controls as to hygiene and other aspects of product handling, disposal, sales, resales and penalties for violations. We or our suppliers may be required to incur significant expense to the extent that these regulations change and require new and different compliance measures. For example, new legislation aimed at improving the fire retardancy of mattresses, regulating the handling of mattresses in connection with preventing or controlling the spread of bed bugs could be passed, or requiring the recycling of discarded mattresses, could result in product recalls or in a significant increase in the cost of operating our business. In addition, failure to comply with these various regulations may result in penalties, the inability to conduct business as previously conducted or at all, or adverse publicity, among other things. Adoption of multi-layered regulatory regimes, particularly if they conflict with each other, could increase our costs, alter our manufacturing processes and impair the performance of our products which may have an adverse effect on our business. We are also subject to various health and environmental provisions, such as California Proposition 65 (the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986) and 16 CFR Part 1633 (Standard for the Flammability (Open Flame) of Mattress Sets).\nOur marketing and advertising practices could also become the subject of proceedings before regulatory authorities or the subject of civil claims by competitors and other parties, which could result in civil litigation or regulatory penalties and require us to alter or end these practices or adopt new practices that are not as effective or are more expensive.\nIn addition, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to pollution, environmental protection and occupational health and safety. We may not be in complete compliance with all such requirements at all times, and we have been required in the past to make changes to our facilities in order to comply with these requirements. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental and health and safety requirements. If a release of harmful or hazardous substances occurs on or from our properties or any associated offsite disposal location, or if contamination from prior activities is discovered at any of our properties, we may be held liable and the amount of such liability could be material. As a manufacturer of mattresses, pillows, cushions and related products, we use and dispose of a number of substances, such as glue, oil, solvents and other petroleum products, as well as certain foam ingredients, that may subject us to regulation under numerous foreign, federal and state laws and regulations governing the environment. Among other laws and regulations, we are subject in the U.S. to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and related state and local statutes and regulations.\nWe are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating to international shipments, customs, and import controls. We may not be in complete compliance with all such requirements at all times, and if we are not in compliance with such requirements may be subject to penalties or fines, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations could also be impacted by a number of pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and other countries. Certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol. New greenhouse gas reduction targets have been established under the Kyoto Protocol, as amended. This and other initiatives under consideration could affect our operations. These actions could increase costs associated with our manufacturing operations, including costs for raw materials, pollution control equipment and transportation. Because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are also subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.\nRegulatory requirements related to flammability standards for mattresses may increase our product costs and increase the risk of disruption to our business.\nThe CPSC adopted new flammability standards and related regulations which became effective nationwide in July 2007 for mattresses and mattress and foundation sets. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in higher materials and manufacturing costs for our products and has required modifications to our information systems and business operations, further increasing our costs and negatively impacting our capacity. Some states and the U.S. Congress continue to consider fire retardancy regulations that may be different from or more stringent than the CPSC standard. Adoption of multi-layered regulatory regimes, particularly if they conflict with each other, could increase our costs, alter our manufacturing processes and impair the performance of our products which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, these regulations require manufacturers to implement quality assurance programs and encourage manufacturers to conduct random testing of products. These regulations also require maintenance and retention of compliance documentation. These quality assurance and documentation requirements are costly to implement and maintain. If any product testing, other evidence, or regulatory inspections yield results indicating that any of our products may not meet the flammability standards, we may be required to temporarily cease production and distribution or to recall products from the field, and we may be subject to fines or penalties, any of which outcomes could harm our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to additional sales tax or other indirect tax liabilities.\nThe application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax) to e-commerce businesses and to our users is a complex and evolving issue and we may be unable to timely or accurately determine our obligations with respect to such indirect taxes, if any, in various jurisdictions. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. In many cases, it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the Internet or e-commerce.\nAn increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices, with or without notice, that impose additional obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. In 2016 and early 2017, we did not have systems and processes to collect these taxes in all jurisdictions where we were conducting business. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we did not, could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. For the amounts incurred in 2016 and early 2017 that remain unpaid, we have estimated the sales tax liability, including penalties and interest to be approximately $2.6 million. We are in the process of assessing our filing status and exposure with each state to determine if we can take advantage of an amnesty program or negotiated settlements.\nIn conjunction with our expanded mattress product offering in 2018 delivered via third-party \u201cwhite glove\u201d service, we determined that we are subject to sales tax as imposed by the jurisdictions in the contiguous 48 U.S. states and have been collecting and remitting such sales tax for all of 2018. If the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we are already subject to sales tax or other indirect tax obligations were to successfully challenge our positions or request an audit, our tax liability could increase substantially.\nWe may be subject to laws, regulations, and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our customers, vendors, merchants, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies. The scope of such requirements continues to expand, requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., No.17-494, reversed a longstanding precedent that remote sellers are not required to collect state and local sales taxes. We cannot predict the effect of these and other attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on e-commerce. The Company currently collects and reports on sales tax in all states in which it does business. However, the application of existing, new or revised taxes on our business, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products over the internet. The application of these taxes on our business could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in the U.S. and in various state and local jurisdictions are subject to significant change, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes. In addition, some states and cities require additional taxes or fees for the right to sell mattresses in their jurisdiction. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such taxes and fees, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.\nOur determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Regardless of the outcome, responding to any such audit or review could cause us to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from our operations.\nThere are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in the price of our securities, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations.\nA number of U.S. states have attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes on companies that have no physical presence in their state, and taxing authorities in other jurisdictions may take similar actions. Many U.S. states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable income or loss attributable to their state from certain out-of-state businesses. Further, we may be required in the future to pay sales and other taxes and fees to states where our products were warehoused before shipping. If more taxing authorities are successful in applying direct taxes to Internet companies that do not have a physical presence in their respective jurisdictions, this could increase our effective tax rate.\nWe may be subject to sales reporting and record-keeping obligations.\nOne or more states, the U.S. federal government or other jurisdictions may seek to impose reporting or record-keeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate e-commerce. Such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance (and legislation to such effect has been contemplated by several states and a number of foreign jurisdictions). Complying with such requirements would require us to devote significant amounts of time, attention and other resources, including financial resources, which may adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nDelaware law and our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contain anti-takeover provisions, any of which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board of Directors and founders that some stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation could hamper a third party\u2019s acquisition of us, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. You may not have the opportunity to participate in these transactions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for equity interests in the Company. These provisions include:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the right of our Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u25cf a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf a prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting and the requirement that a meeting of stockholders may only be called by members of our Board, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u25cf the requirement that changes or amendments to certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws must be approved by holders of at least two-thirds of our common stock; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a meeting of stockholders, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nProvisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against us and our directors or officers and could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, our directors shall not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duties. Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation also allows us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect the value of our business.\nProvisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. It also provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of duty or obligation owed by any current or former director, officer or employee of ours to us or to our stockholders, including any claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach; any action asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer or employee of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or any action asserting a claim related to or involving us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers or employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe will incur significant costs as a result of our operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance with the regulatory requirements placed on a public company.\nAs a public company with substantial operations, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The costs of preparing and filing annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and furnishing audited reports to stockholders will be time-consuming and costly.\nIt is also time-consuming, difficult and costly for us to develop and implement the internal controls and reporting procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Certain members of our management have limited or no experience operating a company whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange or with the rules and reporting practices required by the federal securities laws as applied to a publicly traded company. We may need to recruit, hire, train and retain additional financial reporting, internal control and other personnel in order to develop and implement appropriate internal controls and reporting procedures. If we are unable to comply with the internal controls requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to obtain the independent accountant certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our business and adversely affect the value of our business.\nAs a public company, we are required to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and to comply with other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC. Even when such controls are implemented, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all possible errors. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and subject to simple error or mistake. Furthermore, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, measures of control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, in connection with the preparation of our quarterly report for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 we discovered immaterial errors in the amount of $1.7 million that resulted in revisions to prepaid inventory and cost of revenues over periods from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018, errors in the amount of $1.3 million that resulted in revisions to the three months ended June 30, 2018 inventory balance and cost of revenues and errors in the amount of $0.2 million that resulted in revisions to the six months ended June 30, 2018 customer prepayments, accrued sales tax and revenues. In connection with our quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we revised our 2017 year-end inventory balance and cost of revenues in the amount of $2.5 million. We continue to evaluate, design and work through the process of implementing controls and procedures under a remediation plan designed to address these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and stockholder litigation.\nWe may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy new reporting requirements.\nWe are required to comply with a variety of reporting, accounting and other rules and regulations. Compliance with existing requirements is expensive. As a public company, we are required to comply with additional regulations and other requirements. These and future requirements may increase our costs and require additional management time and resources. We may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our reporting requirements. If our internal control over financial reporting is determined to be ineffective, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affect the value of our business, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to our Organizational Structure\nOur only significant asset is our ownership of Purple LLC and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our Class A Stock or satisfy our other financial obligations, including our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe are a holding company and do not directly own any operating assets other than our ownership of interests in Purple LLC. We depend on Purple LLC for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations, including our expenses as a publicly traded company, to pay any dividends, and to satisfy our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Purple LLC may not be sufficient to make distributions or pay dividends, pay expenses or satisfy our other financial obligations, including our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Moreover, our debt covenants may not allow us to pay dividends.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our Class A Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering in August 2015, although we could lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period or if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates meets or exceeds $700.0 million as of the last day of its second fiscal quarter before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year-end. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to opt out of this extended transition period for implementing new or revised accounting standards, which means that when an accounting standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we can adopt the new or revised accounting standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock by our existing stockholders may cause our stock price to fall.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. In addition, subsequent public issuances of our stock would cause the interest of each current Purple Inc stockholder to be diluted.\nIn connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, some of our employees were granted incentive units as members of InnoHold, which together with Terry and Tony Pearce holds all of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company. On February 8, 2019, at the request of the Company\u2019s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, InnoHold initiated a tender offer to each of its Class B unit holders to distribute to each a pro rata number of the paired Class B Units of Purple LLC and Class B Stock of Purple Inc held by InnoHold in exchange for the cancellation of their ownership interests in InnoHold. All InnoHold Class B unit holders accepted the offer, and each transaction is expected to close sometime soon after March 14, 2019. The closing of the transaction will be a taxable event for the recipients of paired Class B Units of Purple LLC and Class B Stock of Purple Inc, and such recipients, or the Company on their behalf, may need to exchange, subject to the exchange agreement among the Company, Purple LLC and InnoHold (the \u201cExchange Agreement\u201d) and certain other conditions and restrictions, all or some of their securities into shares of Class A Common Stock and then liquidate those shares of Class A Common Stock in order to pay taxes assessed. Some of the participants receiving these equity incentives, including those who no longer work for the Company, may want to liquidate some or all of the equity distributed to them by InnoHold. Sales of such shares of Class A Common Stock may occur relatively close to each other in time, including during short windows of time when such employees are able to trade in the Company\u2019s securities without violating the Company\u2019s insider trading policy, and such consolidated trading in such short windows of time could result in downward pressure on the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nFluctuations in operating results, quarter to quarter earnings and other factors, including incidents involving Purple LLC\u2019s clients and negative media coverage, may result in significant decreases in the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nThe stock markets experience volatility that is often unrelated to operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock and, as a result, there may be significant volatility in the market price of our Class A Common Stock. If we are unable to operate our business as profitably as in the past or as our investors expect us to in the future, the market price of our Class A Common Stock will likely decline when it becomes apparent that the market expectations may not be realized. In addition to our operating results, many economic and seasonal factors outside of our control could have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock and increase fluctuations in our quarterly earnings. These factors include certain of the risks discussed herein, operating results of other companies in the sleep and comfort products industry, changes in our financial estimates or recommendations of securities analysts, speculation in the press or investment community, negative media coverage or risk of proceedings or government investigation, the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather conditions, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting the sleep products industry.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, for use in the business or for other corporate purposes and do not anticipate that cash dividends with respect to our Class A Stock will be paid in the foreseeable future. Any decision as to the future payment of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial position and such other factors as our board of directors, in its discretion, deems relevant. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Class A Common Stock will be a stockholder\u2019s sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Moreover, our debt covenants may not allow us to pay dividends.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules and, as a result, are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements.\nInnoHold holds capital stock representing a majority of our outstanding voting power. So long as InnoHold maintains holdings of more than 50% of the voting power of our capital stock, we will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under these standards, a company need not comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u25cf the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of \u201cindependent directors\u201d as defined under NASDAQ rules;\n\u25cf the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors;\n\u25cf the requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, or otherwise have director nominees selected by vote of a majority of the independent directors; and\n\u25cf the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including exemptions from the rules that would otherwise require us to have a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a Compensation Committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors. As a result, we do not have a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Compensation Committee is not comprised entirely of independent directors. While a controlled company is not required to have a majority of independent directors on its board of directors, our bylaws provide that our board of directors shall consist of a majority of independent directors unless otherwise determined by a unanimous vote of our board of directors. If we are no longer eligible to rely on the controlled company exception, we will comply with all applicable NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, but we will be able to rely on phase-in periods for certain of these requirements in accordance with NASDAQ rules. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nWe may need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nTo fund our operations and growth strategies, we may need to raise additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our equity securities and the procurement of commercial debt financing. We may be required to refinance our debt. In addition, we may also need additional funds to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, developing new and existing lines of business and enhancing our operating infrastructure. While we may need to seek additional funding for such purposes, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand or continue our business as desired or refinance existing debt, and operating results may be adversely affected. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are restricted in the amount and type of additional indebtedness we are entitled to incur, which may delay or prohibit the Company from obtaining additional indebtedness. Even if we procure new debt financing, such debt financing will increase expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictive covenants limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced, and our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share.\nIf the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may be required to reduce or even cease operations.\nA market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities may vary significantly due to our operating performance and general market or economic conditions. Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.\nNASDAQ may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur shares of Class A Stock are currently listed on NASDAQ. However, we cannot assure you that our Class A Stock will continue to be listed on NASDAQ in the future. In order to continue listing our Class A Stock on NASDAQ, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of holders of our Class A Stock.\nIf NASDAQ delists our Class A Stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our Common Stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d If our Class A Stock continues to be listed on NASDAQ, our Class A Stock will be a covered security. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case.\nPurple LLC\u2019s level of indebtedness could adversely affect Purple LLC\u2019s and the Company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations under its indebtedness, react to changes in the economy or its industry and to raise additional capital to fund operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Purple LLC had total debt of $26.7 million outstanding, comprised of $26.6 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement and $0.1 million in capital lease obligations. On February 26, 2019, an additional $10.0 million in debt was incurred upon the closing of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of March 14, 2019, approximately $36.7 million is outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u25cf make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such indebtedness;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of its business;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of its business;\n\u25cf limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise; and\n\u25cf place us at a potential competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.\nWe may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nFuture operating flexibility is limited in significant respects by the restrictive covenants in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and we may be unable to comply with all covenants in the future.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement imposes restrictions that could impede Purple LLC\u2019s and the Company\u2019s ability to enter into certain corporate transactions, as well as increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our business and industry. These restrictions will limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf make capital expenditures in excess of $20 million;\n\u25cf incur capital lease obligations in excess of $10 million;\n\u25cf enter into future asset-based loans in excess of $10 million;\n\u25cf guarantee additional debt;\n\u25cf pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire any capital stock;\n\u25cf make certain payments, dividends, distributions or investments; and\n\u25cf merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of Purple LLC\u2019s assets, other than with respect to the Business Combination.\nIn addition, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants that restrict the incurrence of indebtedness unless certain incurrence-based financial covenant requirements are met. The restrictions may prevent Purple LLC and the Company from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interests of the business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Purple LLC\u2019s ability to comply with these restrictive covenants in future periods will largely depend on its ability to successfully implement its overall business strategy. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default, which could result in the acceleration of Purple LLC\u2019s debt. In the event of an acceleration of Purple LLC\u2019s debt, Purple LLC could be forced to apply all available cash flows to repay such debt, which would reduce or eliminate distributions to us, which could also force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe could issue additional preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests, impairing their voting rights and potentially discouraging a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the board of directors of the Company has the ability to authorize the issuance of up to five million shares of preferred stock as any time and from time to time, with such terms and preferences as the board determines and without any stockholder approval other than as may be required by NASDAQ rules. The issuance of such shares of preferred stock could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, our common stockholders. The issuance of such preferred stock could also be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control.\nTax Risks Relating to our Structure\nAlthough we may be entitled to tax benefits relating to additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with the exchanges of Class B Units into our Class A Common Stock and related transactions, we will be required to pay InnoHold 80% of these tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nInnoHold and other owners may, subject to certain conditions and transfer restrictions, exchange their Class B Units and shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. The deemed exchanges in the Business Combination and any exchanges pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, are expected to result in increases in our allocable share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Purple LLC. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income or franchise tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or any applicable foreign, state or local tax authority may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge. As of December 31, 2018, there have been no exchanges of Class B Units and shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock.\nIn connection with the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement, which generally provides for the payment by us to exchanging holders of Class B Units and shares of Class B Common Stock of 80% of certain tax benefits, if any, that we realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including income or franchise tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. These payment obligations pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement are the obligation of the Company and not of Purple LLC. The actual increase in our allocable share of the Company\u2019s tax basis in its assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of shares of our Common Stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income. Because none of the foregoing factors are known at this time, we cannot determine the amounts (if any) that would be payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, we expect that as a result of the possible size and frequency of the exchanges and the resulting increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Purple LLC, the payments that we expect to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of the Company by the holders of units.\nInnoHold and other owners of the securities will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, excess payments made to such holders will be netted against payments otherwise to be made, if any, after the determination of such excess. As a result, in certain circumstances we could make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual income or franchise tax savings, which could materially impair our financial condition.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that, in the event that we exercise our right to early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, or in the event of a change of control of the Company or we are more than 90 days late in making of a payment due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate, and we will be required to make a lump-sum payment to InnoHold and other owners of similar securities equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our future taxable income. The change of control payment to InnoHold and the other owners could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we receive as a result of acquiring units from other owners of Purple LLC because the amounts of such payments would be calculated assuming that we would have been able to use the potential tax benefits each year for the remainder of the amortization periods applicable to the basis increases, and that tax rates applicable to us would be the same as they were in the year of the termination.\nDecisions made in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by the other holders of Class B Units and shares of Class B Common Stock under the Tax Receivable Agreement. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction will generally accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and increase the present value of such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase an existing owner\u2019s tax liability without giving rise to any rights of holders of Class B Units and shares of Class B Common Stock to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThere may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual income or franchise tax savings that we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement or if distributions to us by Purple LLC are not sufficient to permit us to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement after we have paid taxes and other expenses. Furthermore, our obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition of Units from Purple LLC Class B Unitholders.\nPursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Company will share tax savings resulting from (A) the amortization of the anticipated step-up in tax basis in Purple LLC\u2019s assets as a result of (i) the Business Combination and (ii) the exchange of (a) the Class B Units and (b) the Class B Common Stock, in each case that were received in connection with the Business Combination, for shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement and (B) certain other related transactions with InnoHold in connection with the Business Combination. The amount of any such tax savings attributable to the payment of cash to InnoHold in connection with the Business Combination and the exchanges contemplated by the Exchange Agreement will be paid 80% to InnoHold and other owners of such securities and retained 20% by the Company. Any such amounts payable will only be due once the relevant tax savings have been realized by the Company. Our ability to realize, and benefit from, these tax savings depends on a number of assumptions, including that we will earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which the deductions arising from any such basis increases and payments are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income were insufficient to fully utilize such tax benefits or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders\u2019 equity could be negatively affected.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u25cf tax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u25cf costs related to intercompany restructurings; and\n\u25cf changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15639, "SIC": 2510, "TIC": "PRPL"}
