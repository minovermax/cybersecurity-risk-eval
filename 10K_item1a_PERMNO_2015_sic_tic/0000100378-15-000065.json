{"cik": "100378", "company": "TWIN DISC INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business involves risk. The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report. The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company\u2019s business.\nAs a global company, we are subject to currency fluctuations and any significant movement between the U.S. dollar and the euro, in particular, could have an adverse effect on our profitability. Although the Company\u2019s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in euros and other foreign currencies. The Company\u2019s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the other currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar or euro, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling, and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices. In recent years, the Company has seen significant variations in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets. The variability in these markets has been defined by the change in oil prices and the global demand for oil. In fiscal 2009, a significant decrease in oil prices, the demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets had an adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company\u2019s profitability. While this market recovered to historically high levels in fiscal 2011 and 2012, the Company has since experienced a softening in demand through fiscal 2015. The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nMany of the Company\u2019s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or variable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s overall financial performance. Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, the Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources,\ngovernment and industrial markets. The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors. Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.\nIn the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products. With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years. The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and we expect that they will be able to support our growing needs. However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company\u2019s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company. If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and relationships with our customers.\nThe Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability. To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions. However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing, it could potentially have an adverse effect on our future profitability.\nIf the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected. Although there was only one customer, Sewart Supply, Inc., that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company\u2019s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected.\nThe termination of relationships with the Company\u2019s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products. The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties. If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected. Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nA significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability. As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company\u2019s products is one of its competitive advantages. While the Company prides itself on putting in place procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.\nThe Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 51% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015. We have international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, India and Switzerland. In addition, we have international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, India and Canada. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00de\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u00de\nexport and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds\n\u00de\nproblems with the transportation or delivery of our products\n\u00de\nissues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest\n\u00de\nlonger payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables\n\u00de\ncompliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions\n\u00de\nchanges in tax law\nThese factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA material disruption at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand. The majority of the Company\u2019s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2015\u2019s sales, came from its two facilities in Racine, Wisconsin. If operations at these facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions or other reasons, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales. Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition. The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers. If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to meet our debt obligations and satisfy financial covenants could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2010, general worldwide economic conditions experienced a downturn due to the combined effects of the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns. While some recovery was seen in the markets served by the Company in 2011 through 2015, these conditions made it difficult for customers, vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and caused U.S. and foreign businesses to slow spending on products, which delayed and lengthened sales cycles. These conditions led to declining revenues in several of the Company\u2019s divisions in fiscal 2009 and 2010. The Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and senior notes agreement require it to maintain specified quarterly financial covenants such as a minimum consolidated net worth amount, a minimum Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), as defined, for the most recent four fiscal quarters of $11,000,000 and a funded debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 or less. At June 30, 2015, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient EBITDA levels throughout fiscal 2016 in order to maintain compliance with its financial covenants. However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods especially due to the significant uncertainties flowing from the current economic environment. If the Company is not able to achieve these objectives and to meet the required covenants under the agreements, the Company may require forbearance from its existing lenders in the form of waivers and/or amendments of its credit facilities or be required to arrange alternative financing. Failure to obtain relief from covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nThe Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences. The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved\nbusiness plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nTaxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves. The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. In addition, the Company may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. Future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense and cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose it to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its internal and external data centers, cloud services, and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy. Despite the Company\u2019s security measures, its information technology and infrastructure, and that of its partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of rollouts of new systems. Any such breach or operational failure would compromise the Company\u2019s networks and/or that of its partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and/or regulatory penalties, disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, damage its reputation, and/or cause a loss of confidence in its products and services, which could adversely affect its business.", "PERMNO": 59600, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "TWIN"}
