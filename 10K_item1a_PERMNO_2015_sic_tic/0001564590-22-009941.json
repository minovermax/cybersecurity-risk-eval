{"cik": "5981", "company": "AMERICAN VANGUARD CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRegulatory/Legislative/Litigation Risks\nThe regulatory climate remains challenging to the Company\u2019s interests both domestically and internationally-Various agencies within the U.S. (both federal and state) and foreign governments continue to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses (or the expansion of such uses) of many chemistries, including several of the Company\u2019s products and, in some cases, have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses. The challenge of the regulatory climate is more pronounced in certain geographical regions (outside the U.S.) where the Company faces resistance to the continued use of certain of its products. For example, the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) employs a hazard-based analysis when considering whether product registrations can be maintained; under this approach, EU regulatory authorities typically do not weigh benefit against risk in their assessments and routinely cancel products for which a safer alternative is available, notwithstanding the benefit of the cancelled product. There is no guarantee that this regulatory climate will change in the near term or that the Company will be able to maintain or expand the uses of many of its products in the face of such regulatory challenges.\nThe Russian invasion of the Ukraine may expand into a broader international conflict that could adversely affect multiple channels of commerce and markets. While business operations relating to the Ukraine constitute an immaterial part of the Company\u2019s overall business, there is no guarantee that the current conflict will not draw military intervention from other countries or retaliation from Russia, which, in turn, could lead to a much larger conflict. If such escalation should occur, supply chain, trade routes and markets currently served by the Company could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could materially, adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations and financial performance.\nProduct liability judgments on glyphosate and cases involving other pesticides by domestic courts present a litigation risk to companies in this industry-Multiple judgments have been rendered by domestic courts in product liability cases against Bayer/Monsanto in connection with injuries allegedly arising from exposure to the herbicide product, glyphosate. The basis was purported carcinogenicity based largely upon the findings of a certain international organization, despite significant scientific evidence to the contrary. While the Company does not sell glyphosate, the theory of these results could put one or more of the Company\u2019s products at risk. Further, a number of product liability cases involving paraquat have been filed in domestic courts. While the Company is not a party to these cases and discontinued its limited sales of this herbicide shortly after acquiring an end-use registration as part of a larger acquisition, there is no guarantee that one or more product liability actions would not be brought against the Company on a similar basis, and it is possible that adverse rulings in any such actions could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s financial performance in future reporting periods.\nThe trend of passing pesticide \u201cban-bills\u201d in various states could put one or more of the Company\u2019s products at risk-In certain states, including Maryland and New York, state and/or local legislatures have passed legislation banning the use of specific pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos, or pesticide in general, in spite of valid registrations at USEPA and/or the equivalent state agency. While the Company does not sell chlorpyrifos products, there is no guarantee that one or more of its registered products would not be targeted in state or local legislation of this nature. Further, such legislation could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s financial performance in future reporting periods.\nUse of the Company\u2019s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups-Use of agrochemical products, including the Company\u2019s products, is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal, state and foreign statutes, including FIFRA, the Food Quality Protection Act, Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) and the Clean Water Act, to name a few. These challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the USEPA and/or other federal, state or foreign agencies, the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions, the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the Company\u2019s interests, and/or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by regulatory agencies in the course of registration, re-registration or label expansion. The most prominent of these actions include a line of cases under which environmental groups have sought to suspend, cancel or otherwise restrict the use of pesticides that have been approved by USEPA on the ground that that agency failed to confer with the National Marine Fishery Service and/or the Fish and Wildlife Service under the ESA with respect to biological opinions relating to the use of such products. While industry has been active in defending registrations and proposing administrative and legislative approaches to address serious resource issues at the affected agencies, these cases continue to be brought. It is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed, resulting in a material adverse effect upon one or more of the Company\u2019s products and consolidated financial statements.\nUSEPA has proposed further limitations and taken action on the continued registration of organophosphates- In September 2015, the USEPA published in the Federal Register a memorandum entitled, \u201cLiterature Review on Neurodevelopmental Effects & FQPA Safety Factor Determination for the Organophosphate Pesticides,\u201d in which it adopted a position recommending the application of a 10X safety factor under the FQPA (Food Quality Protection Act) in light of the alleged possibility of neurodevelopmental harm to women and children based on epidemiological data. Since that time, in the face of objection from industry, the agency has applied this safety factor to all registered Organophosphate Pesticides (\u201cOps\u201d or \u201cOP\u201d), including those owned by the Company, as they have come up for review or renewal. The Company, like many in our industry, believes that applying this safety factor is not based upon sound science and that the limited studies upon which the agency is relying (for which raw data is not available even to the agency) do not establish a causal link between the perceived harm and the use of its products. In addition, finding that the tolerances for chlorpyrifos (an organophosphate not sold by the Company) that had been established under FFDCA could not be deemed with reasonable certainty to cause no harm, USEPA revoked those tolerance factors and consequently cancelled the registrations for chlorpyrifos. There is no guarantee that USEPA will not employ a similar standard of review against one or more of the Company\u2019s organophosphates. Accordingly, the Company intends to take all action necessary to defend its registrations. We have been joined in this effort by other companies that are similarly concerned about the potential impact of USEPA\u2019s action. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s actions will alter the course that USEPA has proposed; if the agency\u2019s position becomes final, some uses of the Company\u2019s OP products could be limited or cancelled. Such action could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s financial performance in future reporting periods.\nThe distribution and sale of the Company\u2019s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation-The Company\u2019s products are subject to laws administered by federal, state and foreign governments, including regulations requiring registration, approval and labeling of its products. The labeling requirements restrict the use of, and type of, application for our products. More stringent restrictions could make our products less available, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability and cash flows. Substantially all the Company\u2019s products are subject to the USEPA (and/or similar agencies in the various territories or jurisdictions in which we do business) registration and re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA or similar laws. Such registration requirements are based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions. All states, where any of the Company\u2019s products are used, also require registration before products, such as the Company sells, can be marketed or used in that state. Governmental regulatory authorities have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be fulfilled on the Company\u2019s products. The Company, on its behalf and also in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products. There can be no assurance, however, that the USEPA or similar agencies will not request that certain tests or studies be repeated, or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future. The Company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance.\nThe manufacturing of the Company\u2019s products is subject to governmental regulations- The Company currently owns and operates five manufacturing facilities which are located in Los Angeles, California; Axis, Alabama; Hannibal, Missouri; Marsing, Idaho; Clackamas, Oregon; and Etchojoa, Mexico (the \u201cFacilities\u201d). The Facilities operate under the laws and regulations imposed by relevant country, state and local authorities. The manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the Company\u2019s products occurs at the Facilities. An inability to renew or maintain a license or permit, or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits, could impede the Company\u2019s manufacture of one or more of its products and/or increase the cost of production; this, in turn, would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to provide customers with its products in a timely and affordable manner.\nPandemic/Climate Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating risk, uncertainties and adverse conditions in many industries both here and abroad. The Company is closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business, including how the pandemic will impact its customers, business partners, and employees. While the Company did not incur significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company is unable to predict the impact that the pandemic will have on its future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s operations and those of its customers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to operate without material disruption for the duration of the pandemic or that its financial conditions and results of operations and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by the pandemic in future periods.\nDisruption in the global supply chain is creating delays, unavailability and adverse conditions for our industry, including significant price increases especially with regard to ocean bound shipments. With the prolongation of the coronavirus pandemic, the global supply chain has been under increased stress stemming from container shortages, a lack of domestic truck drivers and a shift in consumer buying habits. Consequently, ocean cargo both inbound to, and, in some cases, outbound from, the U.S. has experienced significant delays, while domestic ports and regional warehouses have been filled beyond capacity. To date, while experiencing disruptions in the supply of raw materials, intermediates, finished goods and packaging, the Company has been able to carry on business without a material adverse effect upon its overall operations or financial performance. Further, there is no guarantee that the supply chain condition will materially improve any time soon or that the company will continue to avoid material disruption. Such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nClimate Change may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business-Over the course of the past several years, global climate conditions have become increasingly inconsistent, volatile and unpredictable. Many of the regions in which the Company does business have experienced excessive moisture, cold, drought and/or heat of an unprecedented nature at various times of the year. In some cases, these conditions have either reduced or obviated the need for the Company\u2019s products, whether pre-plant, at-plant, post-emergent or at harvest. Further, the random nature of climactic change has made it increasingly difficult to forecast market demand and, consequently, financial performance, from year-to-year. There is no guarantee that climate change will abate in the near future, and it is possible that such change will continue to hinder the Company\u2019s ability to forecast its sales performance with accuracy and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by weather effects and commodity prices-Demand for many of the Company\u2019s products tends to vary with weather conditions and weather-related pressure from pests. Adverse weather conditions, then, may reduce the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability. In light of the possibility of adverse seasonal effects, there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain sales performance at historical levels in any particular region. Similarly, demand for the Company\u2019s products used in row crops tends to vary with the commodity prices of those crops in the U.S., particularly corn, soybeans and cotton. These prices may be driven in part by weather, pest pressure, the domestic farm economy and international markets (e.g., yield and pricing from similar crops grown in Brazil). There is no guarantee that the U.S. farm economy and row crop commodity prices will maintain sufficient strength and stability to support the Company\u2019s products at or above historical levels.\nThe Company may be subject to environmental liabilities-The Company is fully committed toward minimizing the risk of discharge of materials into the environment and to complying with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment, its neighbors and its workforce. Nevertheless, federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for any violation of the various laws and governmental regulations. In addition, while the Company continually adapts its manufacturing processes to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities, it cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials. In short, the Company may be held liable for significant damages or fines relating to any environmental contamination, injury, or compliance violation which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition, statements of operations and cash flows.\nAcquisition/Investment Risks\nNewly acquired businesses or product lines may not generate forecasted results-While the Company conducts due diligence using a combination of internal and third party resources and applies what it believes to be appropriate criteria for each transaction before making acquisitions, there is no guarantee that a business or product line acquired by the Company will generate results that meet or exceed results that were forecasted by the Company when evaluating the acquisition. There are many factors that could affect the performance of a newly acquired business or product line. While the Company uses assumptions that are based upon due diligence and other market information in valuing a business or product line prior to concluding an acquisition, actual results generated post-closing could vary widely from the Company\u2019s forecast and, as such, could have a material effect upon the Company\u2019s overall financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s investment in foreign businesses may pose additional risks-With the expansion of its footprint internationally, the Company now carries on business at a material level in some jurisdictions that have a history of political, economic or currency-related instability and customers with a potentially higher risk profile regarding accounts receivable collectivity compared to the Company\u2019s legacy business. While such instability may not be present at the current time, there is no guarantee that conditions will not change in one or more jurisdictions quickly and without notice, nor is there any guarantee that the Company would be able to recoup its investment in such territories in light of such changes and potential losses due to political factors, economic factors, devaluation of local currencies, or the collectability risk from customers. Adverse changes of this nature could have a material effect upon the Company\u2019s overall financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s investment in technology may not generate forecasted returns-The Company has had a history of investing in technological innovation, including with respect to product delivery systems, natural oil technology and biologicals, as one of its core strategies. These investments are based upon the premise that new technology will allow for safer handling or lower overall toxicity profile of the Company\u2019s product portfolio, appeal to regulatory agencies and the market we serve, gain commercial acceptance, and command a return that is sufficiently in excess of the investment. However, there is no guarantee that a new technology will be successfully commercialized, generate a material return or maintain market appeal. Further, many types of development costs must be expensed in the period in which they are incurred. This, in turn, tends to put downward pressure on period profitability. There can be no assurance that these expenses will be recovered through successful long-term commercialization of a new technology.\nThe Company\u2019s growth has been fueled in part by acquisitions-Over the past few decades, the Company\u2019s growth has been driven by acquisitions and licensing of both established and developmental products from third parties. There is no guarantee that acquisition targets or licensing opportunities meeting the Company\u2019s investment criteria will remain available or will be affordable. If such opportunities do not present themselves, then the Company may be unable to duplicate historical growth rates in future years.\nThe Company is dependent upon sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials and active ingredients-There are a limited number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the Company in a number of its products. Certain of these raw materials are available solely from single sources either domestically or overseas. In connection with supply chain disruptions in 2021, phosphorus and related compounds were increasingly difficult to source for our entire industry; ensuring a continuous supply required extraordinary efforts both with respect to sourcing and production planning. That said, there is no guarantee that any of our suppliers will be willing or able to supply these products to the Company reliably, continuously and at the levels anticipated by the Company or required by the market. If these sources prove to be unreliable and the Company is not able to supplant or otherwise second source these products, it is possible that the Company will not achieve its projected sales which, in turn, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company faces competition in certain markets from new technologies and demand for organically produced food- The Company faces competition from larger companies that market new chemistries and other similar technologies in certain of the crop protection sectors in which the Company competes. There is no guarantee that the Company will maintain its market share or pricing levels in sectors that are subject to competition from companies that market new technologies. Further, it is possible that increased demand for organic crops may, over time, reduce the demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company faces competition from generic competitors that source product from countries having lower cost structures-The Company continues to face competition from competitors around the globe that may enter the market through either offers to pay data compensation, or similar means in foreign jurisdictions, and then subsequently source material from countries having lower cost structures (typically India and China). These competitors typically tend to operate at thinner gross margins and, with low costs of goods, tend to drive pricing and profitability of subject product lines downward. There is no guarantee that the Company will maintain market share and pricing when facing such generic competitors, or that such competitors will not offer generic versions of the Company\u2019s products in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the Company\u2019s larger competitors-A significant portion of the Company\u2019s products are sold to national distributors in the U.S., which also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the Company. Typically, revenues from the sales of these competing product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors\u2019 income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the Company\u2019s product lines. With the recent consolidation among domestic distribution companies, these considerations have become more pronounced. In light of these facts, there is no assurance that such customers will continue to market our products aggressively or successfully, or that the Company will be able to influence such customers to continue to purchase our products instead of those of our competitors.\nIndustry consolidation may threaten the Company\u2019s position in various markets-The global agricultural chemical industry continues to undergo significant consolidation. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have grown or are expected to grow through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, these competitors will tend to be in position to realize greater economies of scale, offer more diverse portfolios and thereby exert greater influence throughout the distribution channels. Consequently, the Company may find it more difficult to compete in various markets. While such merger activity may generate acquisition opportunities for the Company, there is no guarantee that the Company will benefit from such opportunities. Further, there is a risk that the Company\u2019s future performance may be hindered by the growth of its competitors through consolidation.\nThe Company is dependent on a limited number of customers, which makes it vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers-Our top three customers accounted for 39% of the Company\u2019s sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company\u2019s future prospects may depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers. The Company cannot guarantee that these key customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels. The loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nGeneral Risks\nThe carrying value of certain assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets may be subject to impairment depending upon market trends and other factors-The Company regularly reviews the carrying value of certain assets, including long-lived assets, inventory, fixed assets and intangibles. Depending upon the class of assets in question, the Company takes into account various factors including, among others, sales, trends, market conditions, cash flows, profit margins and the like. Based upon this analysis, where circumstances warrant, the Company may leave such carrying values unchanged or adjust them as appropriate. There is no guarantee that these carrying values can be maintained indefinitely, and it is possible that one or more such assets could be subject to impairment which, in turn, could have an adverse impact upon the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s computing systems are subject to cyber security risks-In the course of its operations the Company relies on its computing systems, including access to the internet, the use of third-party applications and the storage and transmission of data through such systems. While the Company has implemented security measures to protect these systems, there is no guarantee that a third-party will not penetrate these defenses through hacking, phishing or otherwise and either compromise, corrupt or shut down these systems. Further, in the event of such incursion it is possible that confidential business information and private personal data could be taken. Such an event could adversely affect both the Company\u2019s ability to operate, its reputation with key stakeholders and its overall financial performance.\nReduced financial performance may limit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow under its credit facility-The Company has historically grown net sales and net income through the expansion of current product lines, the acquisition of product lines from third parties and the acquisition of both domestic and international distributors with strong niche market positions. In order to finance such acquisitions, the Company has drawn upon its senior credit facility. However, the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility depends, in part, upon its satisfaction of a negative covenant that sets a maximum ratio of borrowed debt to earnings (as measured over the trailing 12-month period). There is no guarantee that the Company will continue to generate earnings necessary to ensure that it has sufficient borrowing capacity to support future acquisitions or that, when necessary, the lender group will amend the senior credit facility to provide for such borrowing capacity. Further, despite the Company\u2019s long-standing relationship with its lenders, in light of the uncertainties in global financial markets, there is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the Company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the Company\u2019s working capital needs.\nThe Company is subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions-The Company is a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In 2017, the U.S. enacted significant tax reform, and in the long-term certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nTo the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities, the Company may experience lower profitability-While the Company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of it manufacturing facilities, our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors, including fluctuating market conditions, product life cycles, weather conditions in our key markets, availability of raw materials, manufacturing equipment performance, retention of the workforce and regulatory constraints, among other things. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maximize the utilization of capacity at its manufacturing facilities. Underutilization of such manufacturing resources could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s continued success depends, in part, upon a limited number of key employees-Within certain functions, the Company relies heavily on a small number of key employees to manage ongoing operations and to perform strategic planning. In some cases, there are no internal candidates who are qualified to succeed these key personnel in the short term. In the event that the Company were to lose one or more key employees, there is no guarantee that Company could replace them with people having comparable skills. Further, the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the operation of our business.", "PERMNO": 11144, "SIC": 2870, "TIC": "AVD"}
