{"cik": "1446847", "company": "IRONWOOD PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. The trading price of our Class A Common Stock may decline due to these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are highly dependent on the commercial success of LINZESS\u00ae (linaclotide) in the United States, or the U.S., for the foreseeable future; we cannot guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenues from LINZESS to cover our expenses.\nWe and our partner, Allergan plc (together with its affiliates), or Allergan, began selling LINZESS in the U.S. during December 2012. Revenues from our LINZESS collaboration constitute a significant portion of our total revenue, and we believe they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The commercial success of LINZESS depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the effectiveness of LINZESS as a treatment for adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C, or chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC;\n\u25cf the size of the treatable patient population;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of the sales, managed markets and marketing efforts by us and Allergan;\n\u25cf the adoption of LINZESS by physicians, which depends on whether physicians view it as safe and effective treatment for adult patients with IBS-C and CIC;\n\u25cf our success in educating and activating adult IBS-C and CIC patients to enable them to more effectively communicate their symptoms and treatment history to their physicians;\n\u25cf our ability to both secure and maintain adequate reimbursement for, and optimize patient access to, LINZESS and our ability to demonstrate that LINZESS is safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our partners\u2019 distribution networks;\n\u25cf the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in these or other areas, associated with linaclotide; and\n\u25cf the development or commercialization of competing products or therapies for the treatment of IBS-C or CIC, or their associated symptoms.\nOur revenues from the commercialization of LINZESS are subject to these and other factors, and therefore may be unpredictable from quarter-to-quarter. Revenues from LINZESS or other sources in any quarter may be insufficient to cover our expenses.\nOur products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could limit their commercial potential.\nLinaclotide has been prescribed to millions of patients since its launch in the U.S. and other territories beginning in December 2012. The most commonly reported adverse reaction since linaclotide became commercially available, as well as in the clinical trials for linaclotide in IBS-C and CIC, has been diarrhea. In the linaclotide Phase III IBS-C and CIC trials, severe diarrhea was reported in 2% or less of the linaclotide-treated patients and its incidence was similar between the IBS-C and CIC populations.\nThe number and type of patients treated with linaclotide could continue to grow if physicians prescribe linaclotide to more patients and as we and our partners conduct clinical trials, including in new indications, populations or formulations, as well as explore potential combination products, in existing and new territories. As patient experience increases and expands, we and others may identify previously unknown side effects, known side effects may be found to be more frequent and/or severe than in the past, and we and others may detect unexpected safety signals for our products or any products perceived to be similar to our products. The foregoing, or the perception of the foregoing, may have the following effects, among others:\n\u25cf sales of our products may be impaired;\n\u25cf regulatory approvals for our products may be delayed, denied, restricted or withdrawn;\n\u25cf we or our partners may decide to, or be required to, change the products\u2019 label or send product warning letters or field alerts to physicians, pharmacists and hospitals;\n\u25cf reformulation of the products, additional nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in labeling or changes to or re-approvals of manufacturing facilities may be required;\n\u25cf we or our partners may be precluded from pursuing approval of linaclotide in new territories or from studying additional development opportunities to enhance our products\u2019 clinical profiles, including within new or existing indications, populations and formulations, as well as in potential combination products;\n\u25cf our or our products\u2019 reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and\n\u25cf government investigations or lawsuits, including class action suits, may be brought against us or our partners.\nAny of the above occurrences would harm or prevent sales of our products, increase expenses and impair our and our partners\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nIn addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or U.S. FDA, -approved label for LINZESS contains a boxed warning about its use in pediatric patients. LINZESS is contraindicated in pediatric patients up to six years of age based on nonclinical data from studies in neonatal mice approximately equivalent to human pediatric patients less than two years of age. There is also a warning advising physicians to avoid the use of LINZESS in pediatric patients six to less than 18 years of age. This warning is based on data in young juvenile mice and the lack of clinical safety and efficacy data in pediatric patients of any age group. We and Allergan have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients, which is discussed below. These and other restrictions could limit the commercial potential of LINZESS.\nWe rely entirely on contract manufacturers, our partners and other third parties to manufacture linaclotide and our other product candidates and distribute linaclotide. If they are unable to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, unable to source sufficient raw materials, experience manufacturing or distribution difficulties, or are otherwise unable to manufacture and distribute sufficient quantities to meet demand, our development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.\nWe have no internal manufacturing or distribution capabilities. Instead, we rely on a combination of contract manufacturers and our partners to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, finished drug product and finished goods for linaclotide and our other product candidates. Beginning in 2020, each of our partners for linaclotide will be responsible for API, finished drug product and finished goods manufacturing (including bottling and packaging) for its respective territories and distributing the finished goods to wholesalers. Should we, or any of our partners or any third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage, experience setbacks or challenges in our manufacturing efforts, our development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed. We or our partners have commercial supply agreements with independent third parties to manufacture linaclotide API.\nEach of our partners and the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage must comply with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, and other stringent regulatory requirements enforced by the U.S. FDA and foreign regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation, which occur in addition to our and our partners\u2019 own quality assurance releases. Manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with these GMP requirements and with other regulatory requirements. We have little control over compliance with these regulations and standards by our partners and the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage.\nOur partners and the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage may experience problems with their respective manufacturing and distribution operations and processes, including, for example, quality issues, such as product specification and stability failures, procedural deviations, improper equipment installation or operation, utility failures, contamination and natural disasters. In addition, the raw materials necessary to make API for our products are acquired from a limited number of sources. Any delay or disruption in the availability of these raw materials or a change in raw material suppliers could result in production disruptions, delays or higher costs with consequent adverse effects on us.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in commercial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, and shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations and the challenges associated with complex supply chain management. Even if our partners or the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage do not experience problems and commercial manufacturing is achieved, their maximum or available manufacturing capacities may be insufficient to meet commercial demand. Finding alternative manufacturers or adding additional manufacturers requires a significant amount of time and involves significant expense. New manufacturers would need to develop and implement the necessary production techniques and processes, which along with their facilities, would need to be inspected and approved by the regulatory authorities in each applicable territory.\nIf our partners or the third-party manufacturers we or our partners engage fail to adhere to applicable GMP or other regulatory requirements, experience delays or disruptions in the availability of raw materials or experience manufacturing or distribution problems, we will suffer significant consequences, including product seizures or recalls, loss of product approval, fines and sanctions, reputational damage, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related charges and increased manufacturing costs. If we experience any of these results, or if maximum or available manufacturing capacities are insufficient to meet demand, our and our partners\u2019 development or commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.\nIf any of our linaclotide partners undergoes a change of control or in management, this may adversely affect our collaborative relationship or the success of the commercialization of linaclotide in the U.S. or in the other countries where it is approved, or the ability to achieve regulatory approval, launch and commercialize linaclotide in other territories.\nWe work jointly and collaboratively with partners on many aspects of the development, manufacturing and/or commercialization of linaclotide. In doing so, we have established relationships with several key members of the management teams of our linaclotide partners in functional areas such as development, quality, regulatory, drug safety and pharmacovigilance, operations, marketing, sales, field operations and medical science. Further, the success of our collaborations is highly dependent on the resources, efforts and skills of our partners and their key employees. As we and our partners develop and commercialize linaclotide in the U.S. and the other countries where it is approved, and develop, launch and commercialize linaclotide in other parts of the world, the drug\u2019s success becomes more dependent on us maintaining highly collaborative and well aligned partnerships. In June 2019, Allergan and AbbVie, Inc., or AbbVie, entered into a definitive agreement providing for the combination of the two companies. If the transaction is completed, or if any of our linaclotide partners otherwise undergo a change of control or in management, we would need to reestablish many relationships and confirm continued alignment on our development and commercialization strategy for linaclotide. Further, in connection with any change of control or change in management, there is inherent uncertainty and disruption in operations, which could result in distraction, inefficiencies, and misalignment of priorities. As a result, in the event of a change of control or in management at one of our linaclotide partners, we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully execute on our development and commercialization strategy for linaclotide in an effective and efficient manner and without disruption or reduced performance. Finally, any change of control or in management may result in a reprioritization of linaclotide within a partner\u2019s portfolio, or such partner may fail to maintain the financial or other resources necessary to continue supporting its portion of the development, manufacturing or commercialization of linaclotide.\nIf any of our linaclotide partners undergoes a change of control and the acquirer either (i) is unable to perform such partner\u2019s obligations under its collaboration or license agreement with us or (ii) does not comply with the divestiture or certain other provisions of the applicable agreement, we have the right to terminate the collaboration or license agreement and reacquire that partner\u2019s rights with respect to linaclotide. If we elect to exercise these rights in such circumstances, we will need to either establish the capability to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide in that partnered territory on our own or we will need to establish a relationship with a new partner. We have assembled a team that represents the functional areas necessary to support the commercialization of LINZESS in the U.S. If Allergan was subject to a change of control that allowed us to further commercialize LINZESS in the U.S. on our own, and we chose to do so, we would need to enhance each of these functional aspects, as well as develop others, to replace the capabilities that Allergan was previously providing to the collaboration. Any such transition might result in a period of reduced efficiency or performance by our operations and commercialization teams, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize LINZESS.\nAlthough many members of our global operations, commercial and medical affairs teams have strategic oversight of, and a certain level of involvement in, their functional areas globally, we do not have corresponding operational capabilities in these areas outside of the U.S. If Allergan, Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, or AstraZeneca AB (together with its affiliates), or AstraZeneca, was subject to a change of control that allowed us to continue linaclotide\u2019s development or commercialization anywhere outside of the U.S. on our own, and we chose to do so rather than establishing a relationship with a new partner, we would need to build operational capabilities in the relevant territory. In any of these situations, the development and commercialization of linaclotide could be negatively impacted.\nWe must work effectively and collaboratively with Allergan to market and sell LINZESS in the U.S. for it to achieve its maximum commercial potential.\nWe are working closely with Allergan to execute our joint commercialization plan for LINZESS. The commercialization plan includes an agreed upon marketing campaign that targets the physicians who see patients who could benefit from LINZESS treatment. Our marketing campaign also targets the adult men and women who suffer from IBS-C or CIC. Our commercialization plan also includes an integrated call plan for our sales forces to optimize the education of specific gastroenterologists and primary care physicians on whom our and Allergan\u2019s sales representatives call, and the frequency with which the representatives meet with them.\nIn order to optimize the commercial potential of LINZESS, we and Allergan must execute upon this commercialization plan effectively and efficiently. In addition, we and Allergan must continually assess and modify our commercialization plan in a coordinated and integrated fashion in order to adapt to the promotional response. Further, we and Allergan must continue to focus and refine our marketing campaign to ensure a clear and understandable physician-patient dialogue around IBS-C, CIC and the potential for LINZESS as an appropriate therapy. In addition, we and Allergan must provide our sales forces with the highest quality support, guidance and oversight for them to continue to effectively promote LINZESS to gastroenterologists and primary care physicians. Should the merger of Allergan and AbbVie be consummated, we and AbbVie must work together to ensure an orderly transition of this work plan and to continue these commercialization efforts. If we and Allergan (or AbbVie, should the merger be consummated) fail to perform these commercial functions in the highest quality manner and in accordance with our joint commercialization plan and related agreements, LINZESS will not achieve its maximum commercial potential and we may suffer financial harm. Our efforts to further target and engage adult patients with IBS-C or CIC may not effectively increase appropriate patient awareness or patient/physician dialogue and may not increase the revenues that we generate from LINZESS.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to pricing and reimbursement policies in the U.S. which, if not favorable for our products, could hinder or prevent our products\u2019 commercial success.\nOur and our partner\u2019s ability to commercialize our products successfully depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. In determining whether to approve reimbursement for our products and at what level, we expect that third-party payors will consider factors that include the efficacy, cost effectiveness and safety of our products, as well as the availability of other treatments including generic prescription drugs and over-the-counter alternatives. Further, in order to obtain and maintain acceptable reimbursement levels and access for patients at copay levels that are reasonable and customary, we may face increasing pressure to offer discounts or rebates from list prices or discounts to a greater number of third-party payors or other unfavorable pricing modifications. Obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement can be a time consuming and expensive process, and there is no guarantee that we or Allergan will be able to negotiate or continue to negotiate pricing terms with third-party payors at levels that are profitable to us, or at all. Certain third-party payors also require prior authorization for, or even refuse to provide, reimbursement for our products, and others may do so in the future. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we and our partners are not able to receive approval for reimbursement of our products from third-party payors on a broad, timely or satisfactory basis; if reimbursement is subject to overly broad or restrictive prior authorization requirements; or if reimbursement is not maintained at satisfactory levels or becomes subject to prior authorization. In addition, our business could be adversely affected if government healthcare programs, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, or other reimbursing bodies or payors limit or reduce the indications for or conditions under which our products may be reimbursed.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our current and future products due to the healthcare reforms discussed below, as well as the trend toward initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare costs, the increasing influence of managed care, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. There has been significant scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and the resulting costs of pharmaceutical products that could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. There have been a number of recent federal and state efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices, price increases or other related costs. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase, which began in 2019, in the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70%. Healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our and our partners\u2019 ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for our products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results.\nWe and our linaclotide partners are subject to uncertainty relating to pricing and reimbursement policies outside the U.S., as well as risks relating to the improper importation of linaclotide and sale of counterfeit versions of linaclotide. If such policies are not favorable, or if linaclotide is improperly imported or is counterfeited, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly Canada, the countries of Europe, Japan and China, the pricing and payment of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. Reimbursement sources are different in each country, and each country may include a combination of distinct potential payors, including private insurance and governmental payors. Some countries may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we and our partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost and clinical effectiveness of linaclotide to other available therapies. In addition, in countries in which linaclotide is the only approved therapy for a particular indication, such as CONSTELLA as the only prescription product approved for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults in Europe and LINZESS as the only prescription treatment approved for the treatment of adults with IBS-C in Japan, there may be disagreement as to what the most comparable product is, or if there even is one. Further, several countries have implemented government measures to either freeze or reduce pricing of pharmaceutical products. Many third-party payors and governmental authorities also consider the price for which the same product is being sold in other countries to determine their own pricing and reimbursement strategy, so if linaclotide is priced low or gets limited reimbursement in a particular country, this could result in similarly low pricing and reimbursement in other countries. If reimbursement for linaclotide is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at or reduced to unsatisfactory levels, our and our partners\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize linaclotide in such country would be impacted negatively. Furthermore, if these measures prevent us or any of our partners from selling linaclotide on a profitable basis in a particular country, they could prevent the commercial launch or continued sale of linaclotide in that country.\nCONSTELLA was first launched in certain European countries for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults in the second quarter of 2013 and our partner Allergan is currently commercializing CONSTELLA in a number of European countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. LINZESS was first launched in Japan for the treatment of IBS-C in adults in the first quarter of 2017, and for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults in the third quarter of 2018, and our partner Astellas is currently commercializing LINZESS in Japan. In the first quarter of 2019, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration approved the marketing application for LINZESS for adults with IBS-C in China, and our partner, AstraZeneca, launched LINZESS in November 2019. The pricing and reimbursement strategy is a key component of our partners\u2019 commercialization plans for CONSTELLA in Europe and LINZESS in Japan and China. Our revenues may suffer if our partners are unable to successfully and timely conclude reimbursement, price approval or funding processes and market CONSTELLA in key member states of the E.U. or LINZESS in Japan or China, or if coverage and reimbursement for either CONSTELLA or LINZESS is limited or reduced. If our partners are not able to obtain coverage, pricing or reimbursement on acceptable terms or at all, or if such terms change in any countries in its territory, our partners may not be able to, or may decide not to, sell either CONSTELLA or LINZESS in such countries.\nWe and our partners also face the risk that linaclotide is imported or reimported into markets with relatively higher prices from markets with relatively lower prices, which would result in a decrease of sales and any payments we receive from the affected market. Additionally, third parties may illegally produce, distribute and/or sell counterfeit or otherwise unfit or adulterated versions of linaclotide. In either case, we and our partners may not be able to detect or, if detected, prevent or prohibit the sale of such products, which could result in dangerous health consequences for patients, loss of confidence in us, our partners and our products, and adverse regulatory or legal consequences. Any of the foregoing or other consequences could adversely impact our reputation, financial results and business.\nBecause we work with partners to develop, manufacture and commercialize linaclotide, we are dependent upon third parties, and our and our partners\u2019 relationships with those third parties, in our and our partners\u2019 efforts to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, linaclotide, as well as to comply with regulatory and other obligations with respect to linaclotide.\nAllergan played a significant role in the conduct of the clinical trials for linaclotide and in the subsequent collection and analysis of data, and Allergan holds the new drug application, or NDA, for LINZESS. In addition, we are\ncommercializing LINZESS in the U.S. with Allergan. Allergan is also responsible for the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide in countries worldwide other than Japan and China (including Hong Kong and Macau). Allergan is commercializing LINZESS in Mexico and CONSTELLA in Canada, as well as commercializing CONSTELLA in certain countries in Europe. Astellas and AstraZeneca are responsible for development and commercialization of LINZESS in Japan and China (including Hong Kong and Macau), respectively. Beginning in 2020, each of our partners for linaclotide will be responsible for API, finished drug product and finished goods manufacturing (including bottling and packaging) for its respective territories and distributing the finished goods to wholesalers. We or our partners have commercial supply agreements with independent third parties to manufacture the linaclotide API.\nThe integration of our efforts with our partners\u2019 efforts is subject to the uncertainty of the markets for pharmaceutical products in each partner\u2019s respective territories, and accordingly, these relationships must evolve to meet any new challenges that arise in those regions. These integrated functions may not be carried out effectively and efficiently if we fail to communicate and coordinate with our linaclotide partners, and vice versa. Our linaclotide partnering strategy imposes obligations, risks and operational requirements on us as the central node in our global network of partners. If we do not effectively communicate with each partner and ensure that the entire network is making integrated and cohesive decisions focused on the global brand for linaclotide, linaclotide will not achieve its maximum commercial potential. Further, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that our partners devote to linaclotide. If any of our partners fails to devote sufficient time and resources to linaclotide, or if its performance is substandard, it will delay the potential submission or approval of regulatory applications for linaclotide, as well as the manufacturing and commercialization of linaclotide in the particular territory. A material breach by any of our partners of our collaboration or license agreement with such partner, or a significant disagreement between us and a partner, could also delay the regulatory approval and commercialization of linaclotide, potentially lead to costly litigation, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. Moreover, although we have non-compete restrictions in place with each of our linaclotide partners, they may have competitive products or relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If any of our partners competes with us or assists our competitors, it could harm our competitive position.\nIn addition, adverse event reporting requires significant coordination with our partners and third parties. We are the holder of the global safety database for linaclotide responsible for coordinating the safety surveillance and adverse event reporting efforts worldwide with respect to linaclotide, and each of Astellas, AstraZeneca and Allergan is responsible for reporting adverse event information from its territory to us. An AstraZeneca partner is the holder of the global safety database for lesinurad and is responsible for coordinating the safety surveillance and adverse event reporting efforts worldwide with respect to lesinurad. If we or AstraZeneca\u2019s partner fails to perform such activities and maintain each safety database or if such parties do not report adverse events related to such products, or fail to do so in a timely manner, we may not receive the information that we or our partners are required to report to the U.S. FDA or a foreign regulatory authority regarding such products. Furthermore, we or such parties may fail to adequately monitor, identify or investigate adverse events, or to report adverse events to the U.S. FDA or foreign regulatory authority accurately and within the prescribed timeframe. If we or such parties are unsuccessful in any of the foregoing due to poor process, execution, systems, oversight, communication, adjudication or otherwise, then we may suffer any number of consequences, including the imposition of additional restrictions on the use of such products, removal of such products from the market, criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of such products, or delay in approval of future products.\nEven though LINZESS is approved by the U.S. FDA for use in adult patients, post-approval development and regulatory requirements still remain, which present additional challenges.\nIn August 2012, the U.S. FDA approved LINZESS as a once-daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from IBS-C or CIC. Although we and Allergan completed additional nonclinical and clinical studies in adults that were required by the U.S. FDA in connection with the approval of LINZESS, LINZESS remains subject to ongoing U.S. FDA requirements, including those governing the testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information.\nLINZESS is contraindicated in pediatric patients up to six years of age based on nonclinical data from studies in neonatal mice approximately equivalent to human pediatric patients less than two years of age. There is also a boxed warning advising physicians to avoid the use of LINZESS in pediatric patients six to less than 18 years of age. This warning is based on data in young juvenile mice and the lack of clinical safety and efficacy data in pediatric patients of\nany age group. We and Allergan have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatric patients, and clinical pediatric programs in IBS-C and functional constipation currently are ongoing. Our ability to expand the indication or label information for LINZESS to pediatrics will depend on, among other things, our successful completion of pediatric clinical programs. In addition, as the holder of the approved NDA for each of ZURAMPIC and DUZALLO, we are obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of such products to meet the specifications in the applicable NDA, to submit new or supplemental applications and to obtain U.S. FDA approval for certain changes to such products, including changes to product labeling and manufacturing processes.\nThese post-approval requirements impose burdens and costs on us. Failure to effectively, appropriately and timely conduct and complete the required studies relating to our products, monitor and report adverse events and meet our other post-approval commitments would lead to negative regulatory action at the U.S. FDA, which could include withdrawal of regulatory approval of our products for their currently approved indications and patient populations.\nManufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with GMP and other applicable regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or the manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our partners or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may take the following actions, among others:\n\u25cfissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cfimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cfsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u25cfsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cfrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us or our partners;\n\u25cfimpose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u25cfseize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nEven though linaclotide is approved for marketing in the U.S. and in a number of other countries, we or our partners may never receive approval to commercialize linaclotide in additional parts of the world.\nIn order to market any products outside of the countries where linaclotide is currently approved, we or our partners must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other jurisdictions regarding, among other things, safety and efficacy. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve product testing and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the U.S. and the other countries where linaclotide is approved. Potential risks include that the regulatory authorities:\n\u25cf may not deem linaclotide safe and effective;\n\u25cf may not find the data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to support approval;\n\u25cf may not approve of manufacturing processes and facilities;\n\u25cf may not approve linaclotide for any or all indications or patient populations for which approval is sought;\n\u25cf may require significant warnings or restrictions on use to the product label for linaclotide; or\n\u25cf may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf any of the foregoing were to occur, our receipt of regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction could be delayed or we may never receive approval at all. Further, regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory processes in others. If linaclotide is not approved for all indications or patient populations or with the label requested, this would limit the uses of linaclotide and have an adverse effect on its commercial potential or require costly post-marketing studies.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and, if claims brought against us are successful, we could incur substantial liabilities.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of our approved products, including the sale of linaclotide and lesinurad, expose us to product liability claims. If we do not successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for approved products;\n\u25cf impairment of our business reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf litigation costs;\n\u25cf distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u25cf loss of revenues; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe currently have product liability insurance coverage for the commercial sale of our products and for the clinical trials of our product candidates which is subject to industry-standard terms, conditions and exclusions. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for expenses or losses associated with claims. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe face competition and new products may emerge that provide different or better alternatives for treatment of the conditions that our products are approved to treat.\nThe pharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products and the acquisition of rights to new products with commercial potential. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors and enable them to compete more effectively. For example, in March 2019, Bausch Health Companies Inc., or Bausch Health, acquired TRULANCE (plecanatide), which, as referenced below, is a competitor to LINZESS, from Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Competition may also increase further as a result of advances made in\nthe commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Additionally, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive.\nOur products compete with certain prescription therapies and over-the-counter products for the treatment of the indications for which they are approved, or their associated symptoms, and in many cases with products that have attained significant levels of market acceptance. The availability of prescription competitors and over-the-counter products for such conditions could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for our products unless we are able to achieve market acceptance among the medical community and patients and differentiate our products on the basis of their cost and/or actual or perceived benefits. For example, Takeda\u2019s AMITIZA (lubiprostone) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the treatment of IBS-C, CIC and opioid-induced constipation, Bausch Health\u2019s TRULANCE (plecanatide) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with IBS-C and CIC, Takeda\u2019s MOTEGRITY (prucalopride) is approved by the U.S. FDA for sale in the U.S. for the treatment of CIC in adults, and US WorldMeds, LLC\u2019s ZELNORM (tegaserod) is approved for sale in the U.S. for treatment of IBS-C in women under the age of 65. Over-the-counter laxatives such as MiraLAX\u00ae and DULCOLAX\u00ae, and lactulose, a prescription laxative treatment, are also available for the treatment of constipation. Additionally, we believe other companies are developing products which could compete with our products, should they be approved by the U.S. FDA or foreign regulatory authorities and become commercially available. For example, although not currently commercially available, the U.S. FDA approved Ardelyx, Inc.\u2019s ISBRELA\u2122 (tenapanor) for the treatment of IBS-C in adults. In addition, there are other compounds in late stage development and other potential competitors that are in earlier stages of development for the treatment of the indications for which our products are approved. If our current or potential competitors are successful in completing drug development for their drug candidates and obtain approval from the U.S. FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, they could limit the demand for our products.\nWe will incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting any \u201coff-label\u201d uses of our products.\nPhysicians are permitted to prescribe drug products and medical devices for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those approved by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. Such \u201coff-label\u201d uses are common across medical specialties. Although the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatments, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies do restrict manufacturer communications on off-label use. Companies are not permitted to promote drugs or medical devices for off-label uses or to promote unapproved drugs or medical devices. Accordingly, we do not permit promotion of any product that we develop, license, commercialize, promote, co-promote or otherwise partner prior to approval or for any indication, population or use not described in or consistent with such product\u2019s label. The U.S. FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained. A company that is found to have promoted off-label uses will be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. Even if it is later determined that we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. We intend to engage in medical education activities and communicate with healthcare providers in compliance with all applicable laws, regulatory guidance and industry best practices. Although we believe we have put in place a robust compliance program, which is designed to ensure that all such activities are performed in a legal and compliant manner, we cannot be certain that our program will address all areas of potential exposure and the risks in this area cannot be entirely eliminated.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe products that we promote are marketed in the U.S. and/or covered by federal healthcare programs, and, as a result, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to product promotion and fraud and abuse are applicable to, and may affect, our business. These laws and regulations include:\n\u25cf federal healthcare program anti-kickback laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons from offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to us for reasons including providing coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples;\n\u25cf federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs;\n\u25cf the so-called \u201cfederal sunshine\u201d law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians and teaching hospitals (and additional categories of health care practitioners beginning with reports submitted in 2022) to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public; and\n\u25cf state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency laws, state laws limiting interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and members of the healthcare industry, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nOur global activities are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the other countries in which we do business.\nIn addition, we may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, the processing of personal data in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, exercising data subject rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected\nindividuals, as well as how we document our relationships with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the European Commission to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. In addition, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, specific pieces of information collected by a company, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer\u2019s personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom a company shares personal information. The CCPA also imposes several obligations on companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding a company\u2019s data processing activities. Additionally, the CCPA gives California consumers the right to ask companies to delete a consumer\u2019s personal information and it places limitations on a company\u2019s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information. The compliance obligations imposed by the GDPR and the CCPA have required us to revise our operations. In addition, the GDPR and the CCPA impose substantial fines and other regulatory penalties for breaches of data protection requirements, and they confer a private right of action on data subjects (in the case of the GDPR) and consumers (in the case of the CCPA) and their representatives for breaches of certain data protection requirements.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, rules or regulations, we cannot be certain that our program will address all areas of potential exposure and the risks in this area cannot be entirely eliminated, particularly because the requirements and government interpretations of the requirements in this space are constantly evolving. Any action against us for violation of these laws, rules or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, as well as damage our business or reputation. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove costly.\nHealthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products\u2019 or product candidates\u2019 commercial success.\nThe U.S. government and individual states have been aggressively pursuing healthcare reform designed to impact delivery of, and/or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives intended to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, which, among other things, expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual health insurance mandate; included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs; imposed an annual fee on manufacturers of branded drugs; and expanded government enforcement authority. We face uncertainties because there have been, and may be additional, federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. Such efforts may lead to fewer Americans having more comprehensive health insurance compliant with the ACA, even in the absence of a legislative repeal. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that includes provisions to eliminate the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety. In December 2019, a federal appeals court agreed that the individual mandate provision was unconstitutional, but remanded the case back to the district court to assess whether any provisions of the ACA were severable and could survive. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the ACA is still operational in all respects. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, and healthcare reform could increase compliance costs and may adversely affect our future business and financial results.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been adopted that could have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products\u2019 or product candidates\u2019 commercial success. More broadly, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, or the Budget Control Act, includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit, including reductions in Medicare payments to providers through 2029. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or\nother publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or any significant taxes or fees imposed as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.\nIn addition to governmental efforts in the U.S., foreign jurisdictions as well as private health insurers and managed care plans are likely to continue challenging manufacturers\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement, as well as the level of reimbursement, for pharmaceuticals and other healthcare-related products and services. These cost-control initiatives could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 also provides the U.S. FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies approved by the U.S. FDA. We and Allergan have established a nonclinical and clinical post-marketing plan with the U.S. FDA to understand the safety and efficacy of LINZESS in pediatrics. The U.S. FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority has resulted (and is expected to continue to result) in increased development-related costs following the commercial launch of our products, and could result in potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of our products, even in such products\u2019 approved indications and patient populations.\nIf we are unable to successfully partner with other companies to develop and commercialize products and/or product candidates, our ability to grow would be impaired and our business would be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may partner with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or other companies to develop and commercialize products or product candidates. Although we have entered into such arrangements with respect to the development and commercialization of linaclotide worldwide, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future with respect to other products or product candidates that we either develop internally or in-license or that we will be able to gain the interest of potential partners; establish and maintain development, manufacturing, marketing, sales or distribution relationships on acceptable terms; that such relationships, if established, will be successful or on favorable terms; or that we will gain market acceptance for such products or product candidates. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a partnership arrangement is lengthy and complex. If we enter into any partnering arrangements with third parties, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties. If we are unable to establish successful partnering arrangements, we may not gain access to the financial resources and industry experience necessary to develop, commercialize or successfully market our products or product candidates, may be forced to curtail, delay or stop a development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay commercialization, reduce the scope of our planned sales or marketing activities or undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense, and therefore may be unable to generate revenue from products or product candidates or do so to their full potential.\nIn pursuing our growth strategy, we will incur a variety of costs and may devote resources to potential opportunities that are never completed or for which we never receive the benefit. Our failure to successfully acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow and/or adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to explore further linaclotide development opportunities. We and Allergan are exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in new or existing indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions. These development efforts may fail or may not increase the revenues that we generate from LINZESS. Furthermore, they may result in adverse events, or perceived adverse events, in certain patient populations that are then attributed to the currently approved patient population, which may result in adverse regulatory action at the U.S. FDA or in other countries or harm linaclotide\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, each of which could materially harm our revenues from linaclotide.\nWe are also pursuing various other programs in our pipeline, including MD-7246, a delayed release form of linaclotide that is being developed as an oral, intestinal, non-opioid, pain relieving agent for patients suffering from abdominal pain associated with certain GI diseases, the potential treatment of IBS-D, and IW-3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant for the potential treatment of persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease, and the strength of our company\u2019s pipeline will depend in large part on the outcomes of these studies. We may spend several\nyears and make significant investments in developing any current or future internal product candidate, and failure may occur at any point. Our product candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale by the U.S. FDA. To satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and we must engage in costly and lengthy research and development efforts, which are subject to unanticipated delays and other significant uncertainties. Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive drugs, be proven safe and effective in clinical trials, or meet applicable regulatory standards. It is possible that none of the product candidates we are developing will be approved for commercial sale, which would impair our ability to grow.\nWe have ongoing or planned nonclinical and clinical trials for linaclotide and our product candidates, including MD-7246 and IW-3718. Many companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical trials. The findings from our completed nonclinical studies may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and our clinical trials may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of regulatory approval. Results from our clinical trials and findings from our nonclinical studies could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible limitation or cessation of development activities associated with a particular product candidate or program. Furthermore, our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by the U.S. FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Satisfaction of U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays.\nIn addition, because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional products or product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nIn addition, such acquisitions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u25cf exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u25cf disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u25cf incurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u25cf higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u25cf difficulty in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u25cf increased amortization expenses;\n\u25cf impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u25cf inability to motivate key employees of any acquired businesses.\nFurthermore, we may have little or no insight or control over the development and commercialization of any product that we in-license outside the licensed territory. If other licensees do not effectively develop or commercialize any such product outside the licensed territory, our reputation or the reputation of any such product may be impacted. Also, any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale,\nincluding extensive clinical testing and approval by the U.S. FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities.\nDelays in the completion of clinical testing of any of our product candidates could result in increased costs and delay or limit our ability to generate revenues.\nDelays in the completion of clinical testing could significantly affect our product development costs. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n\u25cf recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including competition from other clinical trial programs for the treatment of similar conditions; and\n\u25cf maintaining patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may be prone to withdraw due to side effects from the therapy, lack of efficacy or personal issues, or who are lost to further follow-up.\nClinical trials may also be delayed or discontinued as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results. In addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, an institutional review board overseeing the clinical trial at a clinical trial site (with respect to that site), the U.S. FDA, or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or the study protocols;\n\u25cf inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial sites by the U.S. FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues; or\n\u25cf lack of adequate enrollment or funding to continue the clinical trial.\nAdditionally, changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Each protocol amendment would require institutional review board review and approval, which may adversely impact the costs, timing or successful completion of the associated clinical trials. If we or our partners terminate or experience delays in the completion of any clinical trials, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval.\nWe may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation of Cyclerion.\nOn April 1, 2019, we distributed all of the outstanding shares of Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc., or Cyclerion, common stock to Ironwood stockholders in connection with the separation of our soluble guanylate cyclase business, or the Separation. In connection with the distribution, we entered into a separation agreement and various other agreements (including a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, transition services agreements, an intellectual property license agreement and a development agreement). These agreements govern the separation and distribution and\nthe relationship between us and Cyclerion going forward, including with respect to potential tax-related losses associated with the separation and distribution. They also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time. If Cyclerion is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, we could incur losses or operational challenges or difficulties and may not have sufficient resources available for such services. These arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and over the allocation of costs for products and operations.\nThe separation agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Cyclerion financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution, including any pending or future litigation, but we cannot guarantee that Cyclerion will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and Cyclerion and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Cyclerion. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and the indemnity rights we have under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. Even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs temporarily. In addition, our indemnity obligations to Cyclerion, including those related to assets or liabilities allocated to us, may be significant. These risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the distribution of the shares of Cyclerion common stock in connection with the Separation is not generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nThe distribution, together with certain related transactions, is intended to qualify for tax-free treatment to us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, under the pilot program established in Revenue Procedure 2017-52 relating to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution. Consistent with the guidelines set forth in Revenue Procedure 2017-52, the IRS private letter ruling does not cover all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution is generally tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, completion of the distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, our receipt of an opinion from an outside tax advisor that the distribution will qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to both us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. The private letter ruling and opinion were based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings from us and Cyclerion (including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and Cyclerion). If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Cyclerion breach any of our respective covenants relating to the distribution, the IRS private letter ruling and any tax opinion may be invalid. Moreover, the opinion is not binding on the IRS or any courts. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would recognize taxable gain with respect to Cyclerion\u2019s distributed common stock and our stockholders who received shares of Cyclerion common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Separation, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic, financial or other benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, financial condition, results of operations and the value of our stock could be adversely impacted. The combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our Class A Common Stock would have been had the Separation not occurred. In addition, we are smaller and less diversified, with a narrower business focus, than we were before the Separation and therefore may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions. The Separation also presents a number of significant risks to our internal processes, including the failure to maintain an adequate control environment due to changes to our infrastructure technology systems and financial reporting processes.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we lose any of our current management team or if we are unable to attract and motivate key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or motivate qualified management and scientific, clinical, operations and commercial personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the greater-Boston area. If we are not able to attract and motivate necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we will experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our objectives.\nWe are highly dependent on the drug research, development, regulatory, commercial, financial and other expertise of our management, particularly Mark Mallon, our chief executive officer; Gina Consylman, our senior vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer; and Thomas A. McCourt, our president. Transitions in our senior management team and other key employees may result in operational disruptions, and our business may be harmed as a result. In addition to the competition for personnel, the Boston area in particular is characterized by a high cost of living. As such, we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment efforts, which may or may not be successful.\nWe also have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our product development, clinical strategies and our global supply chain plans, as well as sales and marketing advisors who have assisted us in our commercialization strategy and brand plan for our products. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us, or may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development and commercialization of products that may compete with ours.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology structure could compromise our information, disrupt our business and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of our patients, clinical trial participants and employees. We also rely to a large extent on information technology systems to operate our business, including to deliver our products. We have outsourced elements of our confidential information processing and information technology structure, and as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our large and complex information technology and infrastructure (and those of our partners, vendors and third-party providers) may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. We, our partners, vendors and other third-party providers could be susceptible to third party attacks on our, and their, information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hacktivists, nation states and others. While we have invested in information technology and security and the protection of confidential information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruptions or breach would substantially impair our ability to operate our business and would compromise our, and their, networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our (or our partners\u2019, vendors\u2019 and third-party providers\u2019) systems.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy contest or certain other stockholder actions.\nResponding to certain stockholder actions can be costly, disruptive and time-consuming, and could also impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees. For example, a proxy contest for our annual meeting of stockholders relating to stockholder proposals or director nominees would require significant time and could divert the attention of our management, other employees and our board of directors. In addition, a proxy contest would require us to incur significant costs, including legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nLimitations on our ability to obtain patent protection and/or the patent rights relating to our products and our product candidates may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our products and product candidates, preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nThe strength of patents in the pharmaceutical industry involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time until they are published, and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months or more. As a result, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive inventions covered by our patents and pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. In addition, we cannot be certain that our patent applications will be granted, that any issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents will not be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented.\nWe have several issued patents in the U.S. related to LINZESS (linaclotide), including a LINZESS composition of matter and methods of use patent (U.S. Patent 7,304,036) expiring in 2026. Additional U.S. patents related to LINZESS include multiple patents relating to our commercial, room temperature stable formulation of the 145 mcg and 290 mcg doses of linaclotide and methods of using this formulation, the latest of which expires in the early 2030s, as well as other patents covering processes for making LINZESS, formulations thereof, and molecules related to LINZESS. Although none of these issued patents currently is subject to a patent reexamination or review, we cannot guarantee that they will not be subject to reexamination or review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in the future. In addition, we have several pending patent applications in the U.S. For example, we are pursuing patent applications that cover the commercial formulation of the 72 mcg dose of LINZESS. We believe in the strength of our LINZESS patent portfolio and that we have sufficient freedom to operate; however, if any of our present or future patents is invalidated, or our pending patent applications are not granted, our ability to prevent third parties from competing with LINZESS could be limited and our business and financial results may be materially harmed.\nFurthermore, the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, has made several major changes in the U.S. patent statutes. These changes permit third parties to challenge our patents more easily and create uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and practice of U.S. patent law. Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, narrowing the scope of patent protection available and weakening the rights of patent owners in certain circumstances. Depending on the impact of these decisions and other actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, the USPTO, and their foreign counterparts, the laws and regulations governing patents may change, or their interpretation or implementation may change, in unpredictable ways that could impact, potentially adversely, our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce and defend patents that we have already obtained or that we might obtain in the future. For example, such changes may increase the costs and complexity associated with obtaining, enforcing or defending our patents, including in abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, litigation.\nWe also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our partners and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. It is possible, however, that technology relevant to our business will be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement. Furthermore, if the employees and consultants that are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations. Additionally, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.\nIn addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the U.S., and, therefore, we may encounter problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability, and the ability of our partners, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our partners are developing products. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our potential products may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. There may be issued patents of third parties of which we are currently unaware that may be infringed by LINZESS or our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications which may later result in issued patents that LINZESS or our product candidates may infringe.\nWe may be exposed to, or threatened with, litigation by third parties alleging that LINZESS or our product candidates infringe their intellectual property rights. If LINZESS or one of our product candidates is found to infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, we or our partners could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages and could be unable to develop or commercialize LINZESS or the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license to the intellectual property rights. A license may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the counter-party could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our products, pending a trial on the merits, which may not occur for several years.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or our partners infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf infringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf substantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue infringes on or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and, if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u25cf a court prohibiting us from selling our product unless the third party licenses its rights to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u25cf if a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties, fees or grant cross-licenses to our intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf redesigning our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nWe have received notices of Paragraph IV certifications related to LINZESS in conjunction with ANDAs filed by generic drug manufacturers, and we may receive additional notices from others in the future. We have, and may continue to, become involved in legal proceedings to protect or enforce intellectual property rights relating to our products and our product candidates, which could be expensive and time consuming, and unfavorable outcomes in such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCompetitors may infringe the patents relating to our products and our product candidates or may assert that such patents are invalid. To counter ongoing or potential infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Litigation with generic manufacturers has become increasingly common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, in an infringement or invalidity proceeding, a court or patent administrative body may determine that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. Generic drug manufacturers were first able to file ANDAs for generic versions of LINZESS in August 2016, but we may not become aware of these filings for several months after any such submission due to procedures specified under applicable U.S. FDA regulations. When filing an ANDA for one of our products, a generic drug manufacturer may choose to challenge one or more of the patents that cover such product and seek to\ncommercialize generic versions of one or more LINZESS doses. As such, we have brought, and may bring in the future, legal proceedings against generic drug manufacturers.\nWe and Allergan have received Paragraph IV certification notice letters, or Notice Letters, regarding ANDAs submitted to the U.S. FDA by generic drug manufacturers requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use, sale and offer for sale of linaclotide capsules (72 mcg, 145 mcg and 290 mcg), proposed generic versions of our U.S. FDA-approved drug LINZESS. For additional information relating to such ANDAs, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Frequently, innovators receive multiple ANDA filings. Consequently, we expect to receive additional notice letters regarding ANDAs submitted to the U.S. FDA, and may receive amendments to those notice letters.\nAfter evaluation, we have in the past filed, and may, in the future, file patent infringement lawsuits or take other action against companies making ANDA filings. If a patent infringement suit has been filed within 45 days of receipt of a notice letter, the U.S. FDA is not permitted to approve any ANDA that is the subject of such lawsuit for 30 months from the date of the NDA holder\u2019s and patent owner\u2019s receipt of the ANDA filer\u2019s notice letter, or until a court decides that the relevant patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In the past, we have filed patent infringement lawsuits against five companies making such ANDA filings, and we have entered into settlement agreements dismissing the lawsuits with each company that has made ANDA filings. For additional information relating to such lawsuits and settlements, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, the validity of the patents relating to our products and our product candidates may be challenged by third parties pursuant to administrative procedures introduced by the America Invents Act, specifically inter partes review, or IPR, and/or post grant review, or PGR, before the USPTO. Generic drug manufacturers may challenge our patents through IPRs or PGRs instead of or in addition to ANDA legal proceedings.\nPatent litigation (including any lawsuits that we file against generic drug manufacturers in connection with the receipt of a notice letter), IPRs and PGRs involve complex legal and factual questions and we may need to devote significant resources to such legal proceedings. We can provide no assurance concerning the duration or the outcome of any such patent-related lawsuits or administrative proceedings, including any settlements or other resolutions thereof which could, in addition to other risks, result in a shortening of exclusivity periods. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of the patents relating to our products and our product candidates at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, or could otherwise result in a loss of patent protection for the product or product candidate at issue, and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, which would materially harm our business. Upon any loss of patent protection for one of our products, or upon an \u201cat-risk\u201d launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation, before any court decision or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending) by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our patented products, our revenues for that product could be significantly reduced in a short period of time, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nInterference or derivation proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to the patents relating to our products and our product candidates and patent applications or those of our partners. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. In addition, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our partners, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, as well as the potential for public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceeding or developments, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe incurred significant losses from our inception in 1998 through the year ended December 31, 2018, and we may incur losses in future periods.\nIn recent years, we have focused primarily on developing, manufacturing and commercializing linaclotide, as well as developing our other product candidates. We have financed our business to date primarily through the issuance of equity, our collaboration and license arrangements, and debt issuances, including our June 2015 issuance of our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Notes, and our August 2019 issuance of our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024, or the 2024 Convertible Notes, and our 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes (together with the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2024 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Senior Notes). We currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our LINZESS collaboration with Allergan for the U.S. We believe that the revenues from the LINZESS collaboration will continue to constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. Such revenue is highly dependent on LINZESS demand and other factors such as wholesaler buying patterns. Our collaborative arrangements revenue outside of the U.S. has and may continue to fluctuate as a result of the timing and amount of royalties from sales of linaclotide in the markets in which it is currently approved, or any other markets where linaclotide receives approval, as well as clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships outside of the U.S. Additionally, our sale of API outside of the U.S. has fluctuated in the past and will significantly decrease beginning in 2020. Under the terms of our amended and restated agreements with both Astellas and AstraZeneca, entered into in August 2019 and September 2019, respectively, we will no longer be responsible for the supply of linaclotide API to Astellas or AstraZeneca beginning in 2020.\nPrior to the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred net losses in each year since our inception in 1998. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded net income of approximately $21.5 million. We incurred net losses of approximately $282.4 million and approximately $116.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.6 billion. We cannot be certain that sales of our products, and the revenue from our other commercial activities will not fall short of our projections or be delayed. Further, we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with our efforts to commercialize linaclotide and research and develop our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products, as well as those related to our expectations for our products and our other activities, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. Failure to achieve sustainable net income and positive cash flows would have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could cause us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe have previously raised funds to finance our operations through capital raising activities, including the sale of shares of our common stock in public offerings and convertible and other debt issuances. However, marketing and selling primary care drugs, purchasing commercial quantities of pharmaceutical products, developing product candidates, conducting clinical trials and accessing externally developed products are expensive and uncertain. Circumstances, our strategic imperatives, or opportunities to create or acquire new programs, as well as maturities, redemptions or repurchases of our outstanding debt securities, could require us to, or we may choose to, seek to raise additional funds. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the level of underlying demand for our products by prescribers and patients in the countries in which they are approved;\n\u25cf the costs associated with commercializing our products in the U.S.;\n\u25cf the costs of establishing, maintaining and/or expanding sales, marketing, distribution, and market access capabilities for our products;\n\u25cf the regulatory approval of linaclotide within new indications, populations and formulations, as well as the associated development and commercial milestones and royalties;\n\u25cf the rate of progress, the cost of our clinical trials and the other costs associated with our linaclotide product development programs, including our post-approval nonclinical and clinical studies of linaclotide in pediatrics and our investment to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS within IBS-C and CIC, as well as to study linaclotide in additional indications, populations and formulations to assess its potential to treat various conditions;\n\u25cf the costs and timing of in-licensing additional products or product candidates or acquiring other complementary companies or assets;\n\u25cf the achievement and timing of milestone payments and royalties due or payable under our collaboration and license agreements;\n\u25cf the status, terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing, co-commercialization or other arrangements;\n\u25cf the timing of any regulatory approvals of our product candidates;\n\u25cf whether the holders of our Convertible Senior Notes hold the notes to maturity without conversion into our Class A Common Stock and whether we are required to repurchase any of our Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity upon a fundamental change, as defined in each of the indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes; and\n\u25cf whether we seek to redeem or repurchase all or part of our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise\n.\nAdditional funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of our commercialization efforts, delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our development programs or delay or abandon potential strategic opportunities.\nOur ability to pay principal of and interest on our outstanding debt securities will depend in part on the receipt of payments from Allergan under our collaboration agreement for North America.\nIn June 2015, we issued approximately $335.7 million aggregate principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes bearing an annual interest rate of 2.25%. In August 2019, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Convertible Notes bearing an annual interest rate of 0.75% and $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Convertible Notes bearing an annual interest rate of 1.50%, and we used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to repurchase $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes. Semi-annual payments on our 2022 Convertible Notes began on December 15, 2015 and semi-annual payments on each of our 2024 Convertible Notes and 2026 Convertible Notes began on December 15, 2019. We expect that for the next few years, at a minimum, the net quarterly payments from Allergan will be a significant source of cash flows from operations. If the cash flows derived from the net quarterly payments that we receive from Allergan under the collaboration agreement for North America are insufficient on any particular payment date to fund the interest payment on our outstanding indebtedness, at a minimum, we will be obligated to pay the amounts of such shortfall out of our general funds. The determination of whether Allergan will be obligated to make a net quarterly payment to us in respect of a particular quarterly period is a function of the revenue generated by LINZESS in the U.S. as well as the development, manufacturing and commercialization expenses incurred by each of us and Allergan under the collaboration agreement for North America. Accordingly, since we cannot guarantee that our company will maintain net income or generate and maintain positive cash flows, we cannot provide assurances that (i) we will have the available funds to fund the interest payment on our outstanding indebtedness, at a minimum, in the event that there is a deficiency in the net quarterly payment received from Allergan, (ii) there will be a net quarterly payment from Allergan at all or (iii) we will not also be required to make a true-up payment to Allergan under the collaboration agreement for North America, in each case, in respect of a particular quarterly period.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total indebtedness of approximately $520.7 million and available cash and cash equivalents of approximately $177.0 million. Our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences on our business, including:\n\u25cf limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, including product development, commercialization efforts, research and development activities, strategic arrangements, acquisitions and refinancing of our outstanding debt;\n\u25cf requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, corporate transactions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u25cf placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; and\n\u25cf increasing our cost of borrowing.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness, including payments of principal when due on our outstanding indebtedness or, in the case of our Convertible Senior Notes, in connection with a transaction involving us that constitutes a fundamental change under the indentures governing the Convertible Senior Notes, or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity dates thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay currently planned activities or curtail operations, seek to raise additional capital or take other actions. We may not be able to execute any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. This, together with any of the factors described above, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, while none of the indentures governing our Convertible Senior Notes includes covenants restricting the operation of our business except in certain limited circumstances, in the event of a default under any of the Convertible Senior Notes, the applicable noteholders or the trustee under the indenture governing the applicable Convertible Senior Notes may accelerate our payment obligations under such Convertible Senior Notes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to offer to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, which could include, among other things, any acquisition of our company (other than an acquisition in which at least 90% of the consideration is common stock listed on The Nasdaq Global or Global Select Market or The New York Stock Exchange), subject to the terms of each of the indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes. The repurchase price must be paid in cash, and this obligation may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our security holders.\nEach of the indentures governing our Convertible Senior Notes also includes cross-default features providing that certain failures to pay for outstanding indebtedness would result in a default under the indentures governing our Convertible Senior Notes. In the event of such default, the trustee or noteholders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable under the applicable indenture, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConvertible note hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with our 2022 Convertible Notes and capped call transactions entered into in connection with our 2024 Convertible Notes and our 2026 Convertible Notes may affect the value of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of our 2022 Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, or the Convertible Note Hedges, and separate note hedge warrant transactions, or the Note Hedge Warrants, with certain financial institutions. The Convertible Note Hedges and Note Hedge Warrants were partially terminated in\nconnection with the repurchase of $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes in August 2019. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of our 2024 Convertible Notes and our 2026 Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions, or the Capped Calls, with certain financial institutions. These transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of our 2022 Convertible Notes, our 2024 Convertible Notes or our 2026 Convertible Notes, as applicable, or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Senior Notes, as the case may be.\nIn connection with these transactions, the financial institutions likely purchased our Class A Common Stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our Class A Common Stock. These entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2024 Convertible Notes and the 2026 Convertible Notes, as applicable, by purchasing and selling shares of our Class A Common Stock or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock and, as a result, the number of shares and the value of the Class A Common Stock noteholders will receive upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2024 Convertible Notes or the 2026 Convertible Notes, as applicable. In addition, under certain circumstances the counterparties have the right to terminate the Convertible Note Hedges and Capped Calls and settle the Note Hedge Warrants on terms set forth in the applicable confirmations, which may result in us not receiving all or any portion of the anticipated benefit of the Convertible Note Hedges and Capped Calls. If the price of our Class A Common Stock increases such that the hedge transactions settle in our favor, we could also be exposed to credit risk related to the counterparties to the Convertible Note Hedges and Capped Calls, which would limit or eliminate the benefit of such transactions to us.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to frequent fluctuations. Our net income (loss) and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf the level of underlying demand for our products in the countries in which they are approved;\n\u25cf wholesalers\u2019 buying patterns with respect to our products;\n\u25cf the costs associated with commercializing our products in the U.S.;\n\u25cf the achievement and timing of milestone payments and royalties due or payable under our collaboration and license agreements;\n\u25cf our execution of any collaboration, partnership, licensing or other strategic arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u25cf any excess or obsolete inventory or impairments of assets or goodwill, and associated write-downs;\n\u25cf any variations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n\u25cf addition or termination of clinical trials;\n\u25cf regulatory developments affecting our products and product candidates; and\n\u25cf any material lawsuit in which we may become involved.\nIf our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts for any of the foregoing reasons or otherwise, the price of our Class A Common Stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is possible that our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to use such carryforwards, or that certain transactions or a combination of certain transactions may result in material additional limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nPrior to the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred significant net losses since our inception. To the extent that we do not generate federal and state taxable income in the future, unused net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until the date, if any, on which such unused carryforwards expire. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change.\nIf we do not generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration, if any, of the applicable carryforwards or if the carryforwards are subject to the limitations described above, we may be unable to offset our taxable income with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal or state income tax liability. We have completed several financings since our inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Section 382, or could result in a change in control in the future.\nRisks Related to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions under our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control which could negatively impact the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf Our board of directors is currently divided into three classes serving staggered terms, such that not all members of the board are elected at one time. This staggered board structure prevents stockholders from replacing the entire board at a single stockholders\u2019 meeting. At our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to declassify our board of directors to allow our stockholders to vote on the election of the entire board of directors on an annual basis, rather than on a staggered basis. This declassification will be phased in such that, once completed in 2022, stockholders will have the opportunity to replace the entire board at a single stockholders\u2019 meeting. As required by Delaware law, the amendment to our certificate of incorporation also reflects that, once the board of directors is declassified, stockholders may remove directors with or without cause.\n\u25cf Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n\u25cf Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock. The ability to authorize preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\n\u25cf Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. Furthermore, as described above, until our board of directors is declassified, stockholders may only remove a member of our board of directors for cause. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a\nsolicitation of proxies to elect such acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n\u25cf Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock are not able to take certain actions outside of a stockholders\u2019 meeting.\n\u25cf Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock are not able to call a special meeting.\n\u25cf A super-majority (80%) of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock are required to amend our bylaws, which make it more difficult to change the provisions described above.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results and our ability to meet our reporting obligations could be negatively affected, each of which could negatively affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and includes elements that rely on information from third parties, including our partners. Our system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected.\nFurther, we are dependent on our partners for information related to our results of operations. Our net profit or net loss generated from the sales of LINZESS in the U.S. is partially determined based on amounts provided by Allergan and involves the use of estimates and judgments, which could be modified in the future. We are highly dependent on our linaclotide partners for timely and accurate information regarding any revenues realized from sales of linaclotide in their respective territories, and in the case of Allergan for the U.S., the costs incurred in developing and commercializing it in order to accurately report our results of operations. Our results of operations are also dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of information from any other licensing, collaboration or other partners we may have, as well as our and our partners\u2019 use of estimates and judgments. If we do not receive timely and accurate information or if estimated activity levels associated with the relevant collaboration or partnership at a given point in time are incorrect, whether the result of a material weakness or not, we could be required to record adjustments in future periods. Such adjustments could have an adverse effect on our financial results, which could lead to a decline in our Class A Common Stock price.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC, The Nasdaq Stock Market or other regulatory authorities.\nWe expect that the price of our Class A Common Stock will fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may be highly volatile due to many factors, including:\n\u25cf the commercial performance of our products in the countries in which they are approved, as well as the costs associated with such activities;\n\u25cf any third-party coverage and reimbursement policies for our products;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf developments, litigation or public concern about the safety of our products or our potential products;\n\u25cf announcements of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements concerning product development results, including clinical trial results, or intellectual property rights of us or others;\n\u25cf actual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u25cf deviations in our operating results from any guidance we may provide or the estimates of securities analysts;\n\u25cf sales of additional shares of our Class A Common Stock or sales of securities convertible into Class A Common Stock or the perception that these sales might occur;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf developments concerning current or future collaboration, partnership, licensing or other strategic arrangements; and\n\u25cf discussion of us or our stock price in the financial or scientific press or in online investor communities.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility. Any such litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention, which could hurt our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 93264, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "IRWD"}
