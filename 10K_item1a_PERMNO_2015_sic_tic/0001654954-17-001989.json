RISK FACTORS.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties and all other information contained or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all of your investment.\nRisks related to our business\nRevenue related to disclosure documents is subject to regulatory changes and volatility in demand, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe anticipate that our disclosure management services business will continue to contribute to our operating results going forward. The market for these services depends in part on the demand for investor documents, which is driven largely by capital markets activity and the requirements of the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Any rulemaking substantially affecting the content of documents to be filed and the method of their delivery could have an adverse effect on our business. Our disclosure management revenues will be adversely affected as clients implement technologies enabling them to produce and disseminate documents on their own.\nThe environment in which we compete is highly competitive, which creates adverse pricing pressures and may harm our business and operating results if we cannot compete effectively.\nCompetition in our businesses is intense. The speed and accuracy with which we can meet client needs, the price of our services and the quality of our products and supporting services are factors in this competition. In our disclosure management business, we compete directly with several other service providers having similar degrees of specialization.\nOur print and financial communications business faces diverse competition from a variety of companies including commercial printers, in-house print operations, direct marketing agencies, facilities management companies, software providers and other consultants. In commercial printing services, we compete with general commercial printers, which are far more numerous than those in the financial printing market.\nThese competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and earnings.\nApproximately 13% of our revenue is generated overseas and the unstable global financial markets may adversely impact our revenue.\nApproximately 13% of our annual revenue is generated in Europe. Global financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the effects of these disruptions in the financial markets and the adverse global economic conditions, and if the current uncertainty continues or economic conditions further deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The consequences of such adverse effects could include interruptions or delays in our ability to perform services or to get paid for services rendered.\nIf we are unable to retain our key employees and attract and retain other qualified personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur ability to grow and our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key executives, managers and employees. In addition, many of our individual technical and sales personnel have extensive experience in our business operations and/or have valuable client relationships that would be difficult to replace. Their departure, if unexpected and unplanned for, could cause a disruption to our business. Our competition for these individuals is intense, especially in the markets in which we operate. We may not succeed in identifying, attracting and retaining these personnel. Further, competitors and other entities have in the past recruited and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, particularly our sales personnel. The loss of the services of our key personnel, the inability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, particularly technical and sales personnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives, such as the timely introduction of new technology-based products and services, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to keep our clients\u2019 information confidential or if we handle their information improperly, our business and reputation could be significantly and adversely affected.\nWe manage private and confidential information and documentation related to our clients\u2019 finances and transactions, often prior to public dissemination. The use of insider information is highly regulated in the United States and abroad, and violations of securities laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties. If we fail to keep our clients\u2019 proprietary information and documentation confidential, we may lose existing clients and potential new clients and may expose them to significant loss of revenue based on the premature release of confidential information. We may also become subject to civil claims by our clients or other third parties or criminal investigations by appropriate authorities.\nWe must adapt to rapid changes in technology and client requirements to remain competitive.\nThe market and demand for our products and services, to a varying extent, have been characterized by:\n\u25cf\nTechnological change;\n\u25cf\nFrequent product and service introductions; and\n\u25cf\nEvolving client requirements.\nWe believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u25cf\nEnhance our existing products and services;\n\u25cf\nSuccessfully develop new products and services that meet increasing client requirements; and\n\u25cf\nGain market acceptance.\nTo achieve these goals, we will need to continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing. We may not:\n\u25cf\nHave sufficient resources to make these investments;\n\u25cf\nBe successful in developing product and service enhancements or new products and services on a timely basis, if at all; or\n\u25cf\nBe able to market successfully these enhancements and new products once developed.\nFurther, our products and services may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.\nOur business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of any business that we have or may acquire in the future.\nOn August 22, 2013, the Company, and PrecisionIR Group Inc. (\u201cPIR\u201d or \u201cPrecisionIR\u201d) consummated an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cAcquisition Agreement\u201d). On October 29, 2014, the Company purchased Accesswire. Accesswire is dependent upon a few key partners for news distribution, some of which are also partners that we rely-on for other shareholder communications services. A disruption in any of these partnership relationships could have an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we acquired software with the acquisition of Accesswire. Performance issues with this technology could also have an adverse impact on our ability to serve our customers.\nFurthermore, as part of our continued business strategy, we will continue to evaluate and acquire as practical other businesses that complement our core capabilities. Certain other areas which may expose the Company to increased risk include:\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses into our ongoing operations;\n\u25cf\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and technology;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated expenses and delays relating to completing acquired development projects and technology integration;\n\u25cf\na potential increase in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities, which could restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u25cf\nthe management of geographically remote units;\n\u25cf\nthe establishment and maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf\nthe impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired businesses; and\n\u25cf\npotential unknown liabilities, such as liability for hazardous substances, or other difficulties associated with acquired businesses.\nNew issuers seeking to raise capital and become SEC registrants may choose to utilize Regulation A+ and we may see a significant decline in the number of filings as part of our current disclosure management business.\nOn March 25, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission released its final rules relating to Regulation A+ implemented as part of Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Acts. Regulation A+ will allow issuers to raise capital based on reduced filings requirements as compared to those required under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. On June 12, 2015, the OTC Markets Group Inc. announced new rules and standards for issuers seeking to list their securities on the OTCQX and OTCQB pursuant to Regulation A+. As issuers begin to utilize theses new rules and standards, we expect there to be a decline in the number of filings made by our existing client base. However, we also expect a number of additional equity and debt offerings to occur as a function of the new rules. In the event we are unable to adapt our disclosure management business to address the changes being implemented by Regulation A+ and the OTC Market Group, our disclosure management business may potentially see a material reduction in revenue.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may do so again in the future\nThe Company has incurred operating losses in the past and may do so again in the future. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $1,491,225 of retained earnings. Although we have generated positive cash flows from operations for the past nine years, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in the future. As we continue to invest in our cloud-based technologies and sales and marketing teams, we could experience fluctuations in our cash flows from operations and retained earnings and there are no guarantees that our business can continue to generate the current revenue levels.\nOur business may be affected by factors outside of our control.\nOur ability to increase sales and deliver and sell our service offerings profitably is subject to a number of risks, including changes to corporate disclosure requirements, regulatory filings and distribution of proxy materials, competitive risks such as the entrance of additional competitors into our market, pricing and competition and risks associated with the marketing of new services in order to remain competitive.\nIf potential customers take a long time to evaluate the use of our services, we could incur additional selling expenses and require additional working capital.\nThe acceptance of our services depends on a number of factors, including the nature and size of the potential customer base, the effectiveness of our system, and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential customer, and is difficult to predict. Currently, our sales and marketing expenses per customer are fairly low. If potential customers take longer than we expect to decide whether to use our services and require that we travel to their sites, present more marketing material, or spend more time in completing the sales process, our selling expenses could increase, and we may need to raise additional capital sooner than we would otherwise need to.\nThe seasonality of business makes it difficult to predict future results based on specific quarters.\nA greater portion of our printing, distribution and solicitation of proxy materials business will be processed during our second quarter. Therefore, the seasonality of our revenue makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter and could affect an investor\u2019s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. To balance the seasonal activity of print, distribution and solicitation of proxy materials, we will attempt to continue to grow our other revenue streams since they are linked to predictable periodic activity that is cyclical in nature.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and timely introduce new technology-based products or enhance existing technology-based products, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn the past few years, we have expended significant resources to develop and introduce new technology-based products and improve and enhance our existing technology-based products in an attempt to maintain or increase our sales. The long-term success of new or enhanced technology-based products may depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following: anticipating and effectively addressing customer preferences and demand, the success of our sales and marketing efforts, timely and successful development, changes in governmental regulations and the quality of or defects in our products.\nThe development of our technology-based products is complex and costly, and we typically have multiple technology-based products in development at the same time. Given the complexity, we occasionally have experienced, and could experience in the future, delays in completing the development and introduction of new and enhanced technology-based products. Problems in the design or quality of our products or services may also have an adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition, and operating results. Unanticipated problems in developing technology-based products could also divert substantial development resources, which may impair our ability to develop new technology-based products and enhancements of such products, and could substantially increase our costs. If new or enhanced product and service introductions are delayed or not successful, we may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our development efforts, and our business may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our common stock; Liquidity Risks\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which could lead to losses for stockholders.\nThe stock prices of smaller public companies can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or out of proportion to the operating performance of such companies. We expect our stock price to be similarly volatile. These broad market fluctuations may continue and could harm our stock price. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of our prospects or companies in our market could also depress our stock price, regardless of our actual results. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u25cf\nvariations in operating results;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of strategic alliances or significant agreements by the Company or by competitors;\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nlitigation, legislation, regulation of all or part of our business; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in the estimates of operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analyst that elect to follow our common stock.\nYou may lose your investment in the shares.\nAn investment in the shares involves a high degree of risk. An investment in shares of our common stock is suitable only for investors who can bear a loss of their entire investment. We paid dividends in 2012, and in part of 2013, and every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2015, but there can be no assurances that dividends will be paid in the future in the form of either cash or stock.\nWe currently have authorized but unissued \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Without the vote of our shareholders, the Board of Directors, may issue such preferred stock with both economic and voting rights and preferences senior to those of the holders of our common stock. Any such issuances may negatively impact the ultimate benefits to the holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation event and may have the effect of preventing a change of control and could dilute the voting power of our common stock and reduce the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75754, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ISDR"}
