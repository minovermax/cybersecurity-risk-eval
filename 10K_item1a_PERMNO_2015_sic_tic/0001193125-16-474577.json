{"cik": "1385280", "company": "Cinemark Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business depends on film production and performance.\nOur business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets. Poor performance of films, the disruption in the production of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.\nOur results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nOur results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres. The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons. Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods. The unexpected emergence of a successful film during other periods or the failure of an expected success at a key time could alter this seasonality trend. Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.\nA deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.\nWe rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres. The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with six major film distributors accounting for approximately 84.4% of U.S. box office revenues and 46 of the top 50 grossing films during 2015. Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from the antitrust cases impact the distribution of films. Film distributors license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors. We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre. A deterioration in our relationship with any of the seven major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.\nThe motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive. We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors in many of our markets. We compete for both patrons and licensing of films. In markets where we do not face competitive theatres, there is a risk of new theatres being built. The competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, products and amenities offered, and ticket prices. The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre\u2019s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms. If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.\nAn increase in the use of alternative film distribution channels or other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.\nWe face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television. We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as concerts, theme parks, gaming and sporting events, for our patrons\u2019 leisure time and disposable income. A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels, competing forms of entertainment or improvements in technologies available at home could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video and digital release windows.\nOver the last decade, the average video and digital release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film\u2019s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers at home, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months. If patrons choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Film studios occasionally offer consumers a premium video on-demand option for certain films shortly after the theatrical release. These release windows, which are determined by the studios, may shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nGeneral political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.\nOur results of operations are dependent on general political, social and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres. If consumers\u2019 discretionary income declines as a result of an economic downturn, our operations could be adversely affected. If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.\nWe have 176 theatres with 1,278 screens in fourteen countries in Latin America. Brazil represented approximately 10.2% of our consolidated 2015 revenues. Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the United States. Changes in regulations affecting prices, quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films and restrictions on ownership of property may adversely affect our international operations. Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation. We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and cash transfers to the U.S., all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nWe have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.\nWe have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1,814.6 million in long-term debt obligations, $227.7 million in capital lease obligations and $1,699.9 million in long-term operating lease obligations. Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk by:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments on our lease and debt obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate requirements and to pay dividends;\n\u2022\nimpeding our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our variable rate debt, including our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to invest in innovations in technology and implement new platforms or concepts in our theatres; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results. Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or guarantee that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facility.\nIf we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings. We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 19%. We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company received approximately $9.2 million and $11.3 million in other revenues from NCM,\nrespectively, and $18.5 million and $18.1 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively. Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, more established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals. In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM\u2019s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons. If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.\nA failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile we continue to implement the latest technological innovations, such as 3-D, D-BOX and satellite distribution technologies, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry. If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions. We will continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally. There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities. As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable. The pace of our growth may also be impacted by delays in site development caused by other parties. Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management\u2019s time away from the operation of our business. Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies. Our expansion strategy may not result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows. Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows. We may not be able to obtain such financing or ensure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we do not comply with the ADA and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.\nOur theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws. Compliance with the ADA requires among other things that public facilities \u201creasonably accommodate\u201d individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to \u201ccommercial facilities\u201d conform to accessibility guidelines unless \u201cstructurally impracticable\u201d for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. On November 15, 2004, Cinemark and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, entered into a consent order, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. Under the consent order, the DOJ approved a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres. The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA. If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance. Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to United States federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted. We are also subject to union regulations in certain of our international markets, which can specify wage rates as well as minimum hours to be paid to certain employees. As union wage rates and other requirements change, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, therefore if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.\nWe also have a significant amount of goodwill and tradename intangible assets. Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could result in impairments of goodwill and our intangible assets. As of December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative analysis on our goodwill and tradename intangible assets and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are below their respective carrying values.\nA credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.\nSevere dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all. The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions, invest in technology innovations or significantly expand our business in the future.\nWe may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.\nWe own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health. Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials. We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures, our senior subordinated notes indenture, and our senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us. Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied\ncertain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments. The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorization of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\na board of directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprovisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nprovisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.\nCertain provisions of our 4.875% senior notes indenture, our 5.125% senior notes indenture, our 7.375% senior subordinated notes indenture and our senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a \u201cchange of control.\u201d A \u201cchange of control\u201d would require us to make an offer to the holders of each of our 4.875% senior notes, our 5.125% senior notes, and our 7.375% senior subordinated notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. A \u201cchange of control\u201d would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility.\nFuture sales of our Common Stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.\nIf a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could decrease. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional Common Stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of 178,561,563 shares of our Common Stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes. In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders. We may issue shares of our Common Stock in connection with acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 115,924,059 shares of our Common Stock outstanding. Of these shares, approximately 104,622,631 shares were freely tradable. The remaining shares of our Common Stock were \u201crestricted securities\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be resold in a public distribution except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, including the exemptions provided by Regulation S and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.\nWe cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Common Stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of Common Stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 7,361,757 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.\nRecently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company. Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.\nCyber security threats and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business.\nWe store and maintain electronic information and data necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information of our customers and employees. Data maintained in electronic form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. While we have adopted industry-accepted security measures and technology to protect the confidential and proprietary information, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. As such, we may be unable to anticipate and implement adequate preventive measures in time. This may adversely affect our business, including exposure to government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured. In addition to Company-specific cyber threats or attacks, our business and results of operations could also be impacted by breaches affecting our peers and partners within the entertainment industry, as well as other retail companies.\nProduct recalls and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nWe are resellers of food and we may be liable if the consumption of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury. We are also subject to recall by product manufacturers or if the food products become contaminated. Recalls could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of the product and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time.\nChanges in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nOur cinemas rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing. Any expansion on existing and/or new laws and regulations regarding marketing, solicitation or data protection could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of our email and other marketing techniques and could result in changes to our marketing strategy which could adversely impact our attendance levels and revenues.\nWe are subject to complex taxation and could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation both in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The tax authorities may not agree with the determinations that we made and such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial amounts for tax, interest and penalties, which could have a material impact on our results. Additionally, current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 91915, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "CNK"}
