{"cik": "1555492", "company": "Fairway Group Holdings Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur continued growth depends on new store openings and increasing same store sales, and our failure to achieve these goals could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy depends, in large part, on opening new stores and operating those stores successfully. Successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations and negotiating acceptable lease terms for store sites, and we face competition from other retailers for such sites, and having available capital to finance the build-out, opening and initial operations of such stores. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through new store openings. We may not be able to open new stores timely or within budget or operate them successfully, and there can be no assurance that store opening costs for, net sales of, contribution margin of and average payback period on initial investment for new stores will conform to our operating model. New stores, particularly those we open outside the Greater New York City metropolitan area, may not achieve sustained sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis or at all. Lower contribution margins from new stores, along with the impact of related store opening and store management relocation costs, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we acquire stores in the future, we may not be able to successfully integrate those stores into our existing store base and those stores may not be as profitable as our existing stores.\nAlso, we may not be able to successfully hire, train and retain new store employees or integrate those employees into the programs, policies and culture of Fairway. We, or our third party vendors, may not be able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner. We may not have the level of cash flow or financing necessary to support our growth strategy.\nAdditionally, our opening of new stores will place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. These increased demands could cause us to operate our existing business less effectively, which in turn could cause a deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores. If we experience a decline in performance, we may slow or discontinue store openings, or we may decide to close stores that we are unable to operate in a profitable manner.\nAdditionally, some of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little experience or a lack of brand recognition. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause these new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets.\nOur operating results may be materially impacted by fluctuations in our same store sales, which have fluctuated in the past and will likely fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our same-store sales, including:\n\uf0b7our openings of new stores that cannibalize sales in existing stores;\n\uf0b7our competition, including competitor store openings or closings near our stores;\n\uf0b7the number and dollar amount of customer transactions in our stores;\n\uf0b7overall economic trends and conditions in our markets;\n\uf0b7consumer preferences, buying trends and spending levels;\n\uf0b7the pricing of our products, including the effects of competition, inflation or deflation and promotions;\n\uf0b7our ability to provide product offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores;\n\uf0b7the level of customer service that we provide in our stores;\n\uf0b7our in-store merchandising-related activities;\n\uf0b7our ability to source products efficiently;\n\u00b7\nwhether a holiday falls in the same or a different fiscal period;\n\uf0b7the number of stores we open in any period; and\n\uf0b7the occurrence of severe weather conditions and other natural disasters during a fiscal period, which can cause store closures and/or consumer stocking of products.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAdverse changes in these factors may cause our same-store sales results to be materially lower than in recent periods, which would harm our business and could result in a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. Further, we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, some sales volume transfer from our existing stores to our new stores as some of our existing customers switch to new, closer locations.\nOur operating results and stock price will be adversely affected if we fail to implement our growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful.\nOur newly opened stores may negatively impact our financial results in the short-term and may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis or at all.\nWe have actively pursued new store growth and plan to continue doing so in the future. We cannot assure you that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability. New store openings generally negatively impact our financial results in the short-term due to the effect of store opening costs and lower sales and contribution margin during the initial period following opening. New stores build their sales volume and their customer base over time and, as a result, generally have lower margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, than our more mature stores. A new store can take more than a year to achieve a level of operating performance comparable to our similarly existing stores. Stores that we have opened in higher density urban markets typically have generated higher sales volumes and margins than stores in suburban areas. Further, we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, some sales volume transfer from our existing stores to our new stores as some of our existing customers switch to new, closer locations.\nAll of our existing stores are located in the Greater New York City metropolitan area and, as a result, new store openings can cannibalize sales in our stores in close proximity to the new store and our financial results can be effected by economic and competitive conditions in this area.\nAll of our existing stores are located in a concentrated market area in the Greater New York City metropolitan area and we expect that in the near term our new stores will also be located in this area. As we open new stores in closer proximity to our customers who currently travel longer distances to shop at our stores, we expect some of these customers to take advantage of the convenience of our new locations. As a result, we have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, some sales volume transfer from our existing stores to our new stores as some of our existing customers switch to these new, closer locations. Consequently, our new stores will adversely impact sales at our existing stores in close proximity.\nIn addition, since substantially all of our revenues are derived from stores in the Greater New York City metropolitan area, any material change in economic and competitive conditions in this area or in legislation or regulation in the States of New York, New Jersey or Connecticut and in the local jurisdictions in which we operate within those states could adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nPart of our long-term growth strategy is to expand our stores into new markets outside the Greater New York City metropolitan area. We do not have experience opening and operating stores in other areas and there can be no assurance we can successfully open Fairway stores in other markets or that Fairway stores will be successful in other markets.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe food retail industry as a whole, particularly in the Greater New York City metropolitan area, is highly competitive. Because we offer a full assortment of fresh, natural and organic products, prepared foods and hard-to-find specialty and gourmet offerings, along with a full assortment of conventional groceries, we compete with various types of retailers, including alternative food retailers, such as natural foods stores, smaller specialty stores and farmers\u2019 markets, conventional supermarkets, supercenters and membership warehouse clubs. Our principal competitors include alternative food retailers such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe\u2019s, traditional supermarkets such as Stop & Shop, ShopRite, Food Emporium and A&P, retailers with \u201cbig box\u201d formats such as Target and Wal-Mart and warehouse clubs such as Costco and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club. These businesses compete with us for customers, products and locations. In addition, some are expanding aggressively in marketing a range of natural and organic foods, prepared foods and quality specialty grocery items. Some of these potential competitors have more experience operating multiple store locations or have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and are able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Due to the competitive environment in which we operate, our operating results may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margin from competitive price changes and/or greater operating costs such as marketing. We also face limited competition from restaurants and fast-food chains. In addition, other established food retailers could enter our markets, increasing competition for market share.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe rely on a combination of product offerings, customer service, store format, location and pricing to compete.\nWe compete with other food retailers on a combination of factors, primarily product selection and quality, customer service, store format, location and price. Our success depends on our ability to offer products that appeal to our customers\u2019 preferences. Failure to offer such products, or to accurately forecast changing customer preferences, could lead to a decrease in the number of customer transactions at our stores and in the amount customers spend at our stores. We also attempt to create a convenient and appealing shopping experience for our customers in terms of customer service, store format and location.\nPricing in particular is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we expect competitors to continue to apply pricing and other competitive pressures. To the extent that our competitors lower prices, our ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do and do not have unionized work forces, which may result in lower labor and benefit costs. These competitors could use these advantages to take measures, including reducing prices, which could adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not succeed in offering attractively priced products that consumers want to buy or are unable to provide a convenient and appealing shopping experience, our sales, operating margins and market share may decrease, resulting in reduced profitability.\nEconomic conditions that impact consumer spending could materially affect our business.\nEconomic uncertainty could negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Our operating results may be materially affected by changes in economic conditions nationwide or in the regions in which we operate that impact consumer confidence and spending, including discretionary spending. This risk may be exacerbated if customers choose lower-cost alternatives to our product offerings in response to economic conditions. In particular, a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely impact sales of certain of our higher margin product offerings. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, changes in housing market conditions, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, tax rates and fuel and energy costs, could reduce overall consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. In addition, inflation or deflation can impact our business. Food deflation could reduce sales growth and earnings, while food inflation, combined with reduced consumer spending, could reduce gross profit margins. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe geographic concentration of our stores creates an exposure to the Greater New York City metropolitan area economy and any downturn in this region could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe reported net losses in fiscal 2013, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, and we expect to incur net losses through at least fiscal 2020.\nWe reported a net loss of $62.9 million in fiscal 2013, $80.3 million in fiscal 2014 and $46.5 million in fiscal 2015, and we expect to incur net losses through at least fiscal 2020. Our net losses are primarily attributable to the costs associated with new store openings, increased production and corporate overhead and associated costs of capital, as well as in fiscal 2013 re-financing and pre-IPO related costs and a partial valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, in fiscal 2014 expenses related to our IPO, compensation related charges due to equity incentive grants, the commencement of an organizational realignment to remove redundant costs and streamline parts of our business model to enhance overall productivity and a full valuation allowance against the remainder of our deferred tax asset, and in fiscal 2015 expenses related to our organizational realignment and declines in same store sales and gross margin. For example, we typically incur higher than normal employee costs at the time of a new store opening associated with set-up and other opening costs. Operating margins are also affected by promotional discounts and other marketing costs and strategies associated with new store openings, as well as higher shrink, primarily due to overstocking, and costs related to hiring and training new employees. Additionally, a new store builds its sales volume and its customer base over time and, as a result, generally has lower margins and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, than our more mature stores. A new store can take more than a year to achieve a level of operating performance comparable to our similarly existing stores. Our growth strategy depends, in large part, on opening new stores and, as a result, our results of operations will continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings and the amount of new store opening costs. Other factors that have affected and may in the future affect our results of operations include general economic conditions and changes in consumer behavior that can affect our sales, inflation and deflation trends, the extent of our infrastructure investments in the applicable period, the effectiveness of our price optimization and productivity initiatives, competitive developments and the extent of our debt service obligations. Although we believe that we will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize all prior years\u2019 net operating losses, we cannot assure you that we will not continue to incur net losses or if and when we will report net income. See Note 13 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information about our net operating losses.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe will incur compensation related charges against our earnings due to equity incentive grants to our employees under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and our organizational realignment that we began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2014 and 2015, we granted to our directors and employees an aggregate of 4,530,934 restricted stock units in respect of Class A common stock, or RSUs, and options to purchase 1,724,691 shares of Class A common stock. These RSUs and options will vest over specified periods of time, with accelerated vesting in certain circumstances. We recorded compensation expense for these grants of $10.8 million in fiscal 2014 and $12.8 million in fiscal 2015, and we estimate that we will record compensation expense associated with these grants, resulting in a reduction in net earnings, of approximately $10.0 million for fiscal 2016, approximately $3.5 million for fiscal 2017 and approximately $1.0 million for fiscal 2018, in each case net of tax, based on the stock price on the date of grant as it relates to RSUs and based on the fair value at the date of grant as it relates to options. We will from time to time in the future make additional restricted stock unit awards, option grants and restricted stock awards under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which will result in additional compensation expense in future periods. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for more information.\nIn connection with our organizational realignment to remove redundant costs and streamline part of our business model to enhance overall productivity, we incurred charges, primarily severance costs, of approximately $3.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and approximately $6.5 million during fiscal 2015.\nWe may be unable to improve our operating margins, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to grow.\nWe intend to improve our operating margins in an environment of increased competition through various initiatives, including increased sales of perishables and prepared foods, continued cost discipline focused on improving labor productivity and reducing shrink, and our centralized production facility to serve our current and future stores in the Greater New York City metropolitan area. Some of our competitors do not have unionized work forces, which may result in lower labor and benefit costs. If competitive pressures cause us to lower our prices, our operating margins may decrease. If the percentage of our net sales represented by perishables decreases, our operating margins may be adversely affected. Any failure to achieve gains in labor productivity, particularly the reduction of overtime, or to reduce inventory shrink may adversely impact our operating margins. In addition, changes in federal and state minimum wage and overtime laws could cause us to incur additional wage costs, which could adversely affect our operating margin. There can be no assurance that our centralized production facility will result in labor efficiencies or improve product quality and consistency. If we encounter operational problems at our centralized production facility, the delivery of products to, and sales at, our stores, could be adversely affected. If our operating margins stagnate or decline, our financial condition and ability to generate cash to fund our growth could be adversely affected.\nPerishable products make up a significant portion of our sales, and ordering errors or product supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on our profitability and operating results.\nWe have a significant focus on perishable products. Sales of perishable products accounted for approximately 65% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. We rely on various suppliers and vendors to provide and deliver our product inventory on a continuous basis. We could suffer significant perishable product inventory losses in the event of the loss of a major supplier or vendor, disruption of our supply chain, extended power outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences. While we have implemented certain systems to ensure our ordering is in line with demand, we cannot assure you that our ordering systems will always work efficiently, in particular in connection with the opening of new stores, which have no, or a limited, ordering history. If we were to over-order, we could suffer inventory losses, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nDisruption of significant supplier relationships could negatively affect our business.\nOur single largest third-party supplier in fiscal 2013, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 (until it was replaced in December 2014 following its bankruptcy) was White Rose. Under our agreement with White Rose, we were obligated to purchase substantially all our requirements for specified products, principally conventional grocery, dairy, frozen food and ice cream products, which were available from White Rose, for our existing stores. In December 2014, we replaced White Rose with C&S, and C&S is now our largest supplier, and under our agreement with C&S we are obligated to purchase substantially all our requirements for specified products, principally conventional grocery, dairy, frozen food and ice cream products that are available from C&S, for our existing stores. Total purchases from White Rose and C&S during fiscal 2013, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2015 accounted for approximately 15%, 16%, and 15% of our total purchases, respectively. In addition, United Natural Foods, Inc. (\u201cUNFI\u201d), which is our primary supplier of specified natural and organic products, principally dry grocery, frozen food, vitamins/supplements and health, beauty and wellness, accounted for approximately 9% of our total purchases in each of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 and 10% of our total purchases in fiscal 2015. Due to this concentration of purchases from C&S and UNFI, the cancellation of our supply arrangement with either C&S or UNFI or the disruption, delay or inability of C&S or UNFI to deliver product to our stores may materially and adversely affect our operating results\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwhile we establish alternative distribution channels. We also depend on third-party suppliers for our private label products, and the cancellation of our supply arrangement with any of these suppliers or the disruption, delay or inability of these suppliers to provide our private label products, particularly private label organic products, could adversely affect our private label sales. If our suppliers fail to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted. We cannot assure you that we would be able to find replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms.\nOur success depends upon our ability to source and market new products that meet our high standards and customer preferences and our ability to offer our customers an aesthetically pleasing shopping environment.\nOur success depends on our ability to source and market new products that meet our standards for quality and appeal to our customers\u2019 preferences. Failure to source and market such products, or to accurately forecast changing customer preferences, could lead to a decrease in the number of customer transactions at our stores and in the amount customers spend at our stores. In addition, the sourcing of our products is dependent, in part, on our relationships with our vendors. We rely on a large number of small vendors in order to offer a broad array of products, and as we expand it may become more difficult to manage and maintain these relationships. If we are unable to maintain these relationships we may not be able to continue to source products at competitive prices that both meet our standards and appeal to our customers. We also attempt to create a pleasant and appealing shopping experience. If we are not successful in creating a pleasant and appealing shopping experience, we may lose customers to our competitors. If we do not succeed in maintaining good relationships with our vendors, introducing and sourcing new products that consumers want to buy or are unable to provide a pleasant and appealing shopping environment or maintain our level of customer service, our sales, operating margins and market share may decrease, resulting in reduced profitability.\nWe may experience negative effects to our brand and reputation from real or perceived quality or health issues with our food products, which could lead to product liability claims or have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe believe that our reputation for providing our customers with fresh, high-quality food products is an important component of our customer value proposition and that maintaining our brand is critical to our success. Brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets, governmental investigations or litigation, which can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business. Concerns regarding the safety or quality of our food products or of our food supply chain could cause consumers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of food, even if the basis for the concern is unfounded, has been addressed or is outside of our control. Food products containing contaminants or allergens could be inadvertently manufactured, prepared or distributed by us and, if processing at the consumer level does not eliminate them, these contaminants could result in illness or death. Adverse publicity about these concerns, whether or not ultimately based on fact, and whether or not involving products sold at our stores, could discourage consumers from buying our products, which could have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results. In addition, our stores are subject to unscheduled inspections on a regular basis, which, if violations are found, could result in the assessment of fines, suspension of one or more needed licenses and, in the case of repeated \u201ccritical\u201d violations, closure of the store until a re-inspection demonstrates that we have remediated the problem.\nFurthermore, the sale of food products entails an inherent risk of product liability claims, product recall and the resulting negative publicity. Any such claims, recalls or adverse publicity with respect to our private-label products may have an even greater negative effect on our sales and operating results, in addition to generating adverse publicity for our brand. Moreover, product liability claims of this sort may not be covered by insurance or any rights to indemnity or contribution we have against others.\nAny lost confidence in us on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to re-establish. Any such adverse effect could significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any food items sold by us, regardless of the cause, could have a substantial and adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nWe may be unable to protect or maintain our intellectual property, which could result in customer confusion, a negative perception of our brand and adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks and servicemarks, including our FAIRWAY\u00ae, FAIRWAY \u201cLike No Other Market\u201d\u00ae, LIKE NO OTHER MARKET\u00ae and FAIRWAY WINES & SPIRITS\u00ae trademarks, are valuable assets that reinforce our customers\u2019 favorable perception of our stores.\nFrom time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis, including, where appropriate, by sending cease and desist letters and commencing opposition actions and litigation. The outcomes of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthese actions have included both negotiated out-of-court settlements as well as litigation. We are currently party to a settlement with a midwestern grocery company, \u201cFareway,\u201d with respect to the use of the Fairway name and trademarks which prohibits us from using the Fairway name other than on the East Coast and in California and certain parts of Michigan and Ohio, and prohibits that company from using the Fareway name on the East Coast and in California and certain parts of Michigan and Ohio. Our inability to use the Fairway name in these prohibited areas could adversely affect our growth strategy. We are also party to a settlement agreement that prohibits us from opening any new stores under the Fairway name in certain parts of the New Jersey counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic. We believe this agreement will preclude us from opening one store that we otherwise might have opened in this territory.\nWe cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers\u2019 perception of our brand and products, which could, in turn, adversely affect our sales and profitability. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject us to liabilities, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force us to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on information technology and administrative systems and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breach of those systems may harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology and administrative systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology or administrative systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business to suffer. In addition, our information technology and administrative systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, cyber-attacks, viruses and security breaches, including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems that could result in the compromise of confidential customer data. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause us to face significant fines, customer notice obligations or costly litigation, harm our reputation with our customers, require us to expend significant time and expense developing, maintaining or upgrading our information technology or administrative systems, or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees, receiving payments from our customers or performing other information technology or administrative services on a timely basis. Any material interruption in our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we experience a data security breach and confidential customer or employee information is disclosed, we may be subject to penalties and experience negative publicity, which could affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and our customers could suffer harm if customer or employee information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in our systems. The collection of data and processing of transactions require us to receive, transmit and store a large amount of personally identifiable and transaction related data. This type of data is subject to legislation and regulation in various jurisdictions. Recently, data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting state and federal legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. If some of the current proposals are adopted, we may be subject to more extensive requirements to protect the customer information that we process in connection with the purchases of our products. We may become exposed to potential liabilities with respect to the data that we collect, manage and process, and may incur legal costs if our information security policies and procedures are not effective or if we are required to defend our methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to our methods of handling personal data could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments. Additionally, if we suffer data breaches one or more of the credit card processing companies that we rely on may refuse to allow us to continue to participate in their network, which would limit our ability to accept credit cards at our stores and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nData theft, information espionage or other criminal activity directed at the retail industry or computer or communications systems may materially adversely affect our business by causing us to implement costly security measures in recognition of actual or potential threats, by requiring us to expend significant time and expense developing, maintaining or upgrading our information\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntechnology systems and by causing us to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages. Such activities may also materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing consumer confidence in the marketplace and by modifying consumer spending habits. Over the past 12 months several retailers have been subject to data theft, which has adversely affected their business.\nWe lease certain of our stores and related properties from a related party.\nHoward Glickberg, one of our directors and a former executive officer, owns a one-third interest in entities which lease to us the premises where a portion of our Broadway store is located, the premises where our Harlem store, Harlem bakery and Harlem warehouse are located and the premises where the parking lot for our Harlem store is located. The remainder of these entities is owned by Mr. Glickberg\u2019s former business partners. Mr. Glickberg also owns a one-sixth interest in the landlord for the premises where our Red Hook store is located. During fiscal 2013, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, rental payments (excluding maintenance and taxes that we are obligated to pay) under the leases for the Harlem properties and portion of the Broadway store aggregated $4,433,500, $4,455,087 and $4,527,816 respectively, of which, based on his ownership and before giving effect to any expenses, Mr. Glickberg is entitled to $1,477,833, $1,485,029 and $1,509,272, respectively. During fiscal 2013, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, rental payments (excluding maintenance and taxes that we are obligated to pay) under the lease for the Red Hook store aggregated $1,386,180, $1,421,151 and $2,833,727, respectively, of which, based on his ownership and before giving effect to any expenses, Mr. Glickberg is entitled to $231,030, $236,859 and $472,288, respectively.\nIn addition, our Red Hook store is required to obtain its electricity, heated/chilled water, hot and cold potable water and sewer services from an entity owned by the owners of the premises where our Red Hook store is located. We believe that the owner of the co-generation plant has overcharged us for utilities since our initial occupancy of the premises in December 2005. Since November 2008, with the exception of the post-Hurricane Sandy period through fiscal 2014, when we received utilities from the local utility provider because the co-generation plant was not operational, we have not fully paid the utility invoices, but instead remitted lesser amounts based on the methodology that we believe represents the parties\u2019 original intentions with respect to the utility charge calculations. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to pay the amounts we withheld.\nFailure to retain our senior management and other key personnel may adversely affect our operations.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key personnel. These executives are primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand and culture, and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause our stock price to decline. The loss of key employees could negatively affect our business.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain employees, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business.\nThe food retail industry is labor intensive, and our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling wage and labor-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force in the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, unionization of the available work force, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in and enforcement of immigration laws could increase our costs and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified store-level employees.\nFederal and state governments from time to time implement laws, regulations or programs that regulate our ability to attract or retain qualified employees. Some of these changes may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we have implemented, and are in the process of enhancing, procedures to ensure our compliance with the employment eligibility verification requirements, there can be no assurance that these procedures are adequate and some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. The employment of unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or civil or criminal penalties,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and makes it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. We have from time to time been required to terminate the employment of certain of our employees who were determined to be unauthorized workers. There can be no assurance that any future audit will not require us to terminate employees and pay fines or other penalties. The termination of a significant number of employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. Our financial performance could be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.\nProlonged labor disputes with unionized employees and increases in labor costs could adversely affect our business.\nOur largest operating costs are attributable to labor costs and, therefore, our financial performance is greatly influenced by increases in wage and benefit costs, including pension and health care costs. As a result, we are exposed to risks associated with a competitive labor market and, more specifically, to any disruption of our unionized work force. As of May 15, 2015, approximately 83.3% of our employees were represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to periodic renegotiation. One of our current collective bargaining agreements expired in February 2015, two expired in March 2015 and one expired in April 2015. Fairway and one of the union locals, which represents 12 of the 15 food stores, reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement which was approved on May 21, 2015 with immediate effect. Similar collective bargaining agreements are being finalized with the other union locals, which represent the remaining stores. The parties have agreed to continue operating under the current contracts until new collective bargaining agreements are finalized. All the new collective bargaining agreements are expected to have a three year term. One collective bargaining agreement expires in September 2016. We consider our employee relations to be good. We have never experienced a strike or significant work stoppage.\nIn the renegotiation of our current contracts and the negotiation of our new contracts, rising health care and pension costs and the nature and structure of work rules were and will be important issues. The terms of any renegotiated collective bargaining agreements could create either a financial advantage or disadvantage for us as compared to our major competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our labor negotiations may not conclude successfully or may result in a significant increase in labor costs, and work stoppages or labor disturbances could occur. A prolonged work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also expect that in the event of a work stoppage or labor disturbance, we could incur additional costs and face increased competition.\nThere have recently been a number of proposals both at the Federal level and in the states we operate to increase the minimum wage and increase the number of employees eligible for overtime wages. Any such increase in wages and overtime costs may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn May 2014, a purported wage and hour class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our current and former officers and employees. This suit alleges, among other things, that certain of our past and current employees were not properly compensated in accordance with the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. In May 2015, the Company and plaintiffs agreed in principle to settle the matter without material financial consequence.\nThe cost of providing employee benefits continues to increase and is subject to factors outside of our control.\nWe provide health benefits to substantially all of our full-time employees and, under our collective bargaining agreements, contribute to the cost of health benefits provided through multi-employer plans. Even though employees generally pay a portion of the cost, our cost of providing these benefits has increased steadily over the last several years. We anticipate future increases in the cost of health benefits due to health care inflation and continued implementation of the federal healthcare reform legislation. We currently pay most of the healthcare insurance premiums for our unionized employees. On March 29, 2015, we had approximately 3,700 unionized employees. We cannot at this time predict with certainty the continued financial impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to control healthcare costs, we will experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in one underfunded multiemployer pension plan on behalf of most of our union-affiliated employees, and we are required to make contributions to this plan under our collective bargaining agreement. This multiemployer pension plan is currently underfunded in part due to increases in the costs of benefits provided or paid under the plan as well as lower returns on plan assets. The unfunded liabilities of this plan may require increased future payments by us and other participating employers. As of December 31, 2014, this multiemployer plan was deemed by its plan actuary to be \u201cendangered\u201d because the plan is less than 80% funded. As a result, the plan has adopted a funding improvement plan to increase the plan\u2019s funding percentage. In the future, our required contributions to this multiemployer plan could increase as a result of many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining with the union, actions taken by trustees who manage the plan, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plan and the payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit the plan. Our risk of future increased payments may be greater\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nif other participating employers withdraw from the plan and are not able to pay the total liability assessed as a result of such withdrawal, or if the pension plan adopts surcharges and/or increased pension contributions as part of a rehabilitation plan. Increased pension costs may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nVarious aspects of our business are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as planned.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, environmental protection, workplace safety, food safety, public health, community right-to-know and alcoholic beverage and tobacco sales. In particular, the states in which we operate and several local jurisdictions regulate the licensing of supermarkets and the sale of alcoholic beverages. In addition, certain local regulations may limit our ability to sell alcoholic beverages at certain times. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, immigration, disabled access and work permit requirements. Compliance with new laws in these areas, or with new or stricter interpretations of existing requirements, could reduce the revenue and profitability of our stores and could otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our new store openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Our stores are subject to unscheduled inspections on a regular basis, which, if violations are found, could result in the assessment of fines, suspension of one or more needed licenses and, in the case of repeated \u201ccritical\u201d violations, closure of the store until a re-inspection demonstrates that we have remediated the problem. Certain of our parking lots and warehouses either have only temporary certificates of occupancy or are awaiting a certificate of occupancy which, if not granted, would require us to stop using such property. Our central bakery does not have a certificate of occupancy and, due to the age and structure of the building, we do not believe we would be able to obtain one without substantial modifications to the building. We are in the process of relocating the central bakery; however, until we do so, if we are not permitted to continue our central bakery operations at our current facility, our results of operations could be adversely affected. The buildings in which our Broadway and Harlem stores are located are old and therefore require greater maintenance expenditures by us in order to maintain them in compliance with applicable building codes. If we are unable to maintain these stores in compliance with applicable building codes, we could be required by the building department to close them. Additionally, a number of federal, state and local laws impose requirements or restrictions on business owners with respect to access by disabled persons. Our compliance with these laws may result in modifications to our properties, or prevent us from performing certain further renovations. We cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future.\nThe terms of our senior credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and to manage our operations.\nOur senior credit facility includes a number of customary restrictive covenants that could impair our financing and operational flexibility and make it difficult for us to react to market conditions and satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. Specifically, such covenants may restrict our ability and, if applicable, the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\uf0b7incur additional debt;\n\uf0b7make certain investments;\n\uf0b7enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\uf0b7limit dividends or other payments by our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\uf0b7use assets as security in other transactions;\n\uf0b7pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase our equity interests;\n\uf0b7sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\uf0b7guarantee the debts of others;\n\uf0b7enter into new lines of business;\n\uf0b7make capital expenditures;\n\uf0b7prepay, redeem or exchange our other debt; and\n\uf0b7form any joint ventures or subsidiary investments.\nIn addition, our senior credit facility requires us to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio financial covenant.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our senior credit facility will depend on our future operating performance and, in addition, may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. If we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfail to comply with such covenants and terms, we would be required to obtain waivers from our lenders or agree with our lenders to an amendment of the facility\u2019s terms to maintain compliance under such facility. If we are unable to obtain any necessary waivers and the debt under our senior credit facility is accelerated, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future operating performance.\nOur senior credit facility requires us to use 50% of our annual adjusted excess cash flow (which percentage will decrease upon achievement and maintenance of specified leverage ratios) to prepay our outstanding term loans. This requirement will reduce the funds available to us for new store growth and working capital.\nOur senior credit facility limits the amount of capital expenditures that we can make in any fiscal year that are not financed with proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. This limitation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or result in additional dilution if we issue additional equity securities.\nOur senior credit facility provides that if any person other than Sterling Investment Partners owns, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, shares representing more than 35% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, the lenders can declare all borrowings under the senior credit facility to be immediately due and payable.\nWe have significant debt service obligations and may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes to our business.\nAs of March 29, 2015, we had gross total debt obligations of approximately $268.8 million (not reduced by unamortized original issue discount of approximately $11.7 million on our senior debt). Our indebtedness, or any additional indebtedness we may incur, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all.\nOur level of indebtedness has important consequences. For example, our level of indebtedness may:\n\uf0b7require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for working capital, new store growth and other general corporate purposes;\n\uf0b7limit our ability to pay future dividends;\n\uf0b7limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, new store growth, capital expenditures and other investments, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategy;\n\uf0b7heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the food retail industry or the general economy and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the food retail industry;\n\uf0b7expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as our borrowings under our senior credit facility are at variable rates; or\n\uf0b7prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our store base and product offerings.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior credit facility. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make payments on our indebtedness or to fund our operations.\nOur plans to open new stores require us to spend capital, which must be allocated among various projects. Failure to use our capital efficiently could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur growth strategy depends on the opening of new stores, which will require us to use cash generated by our operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility. However, we have limited availability under our existing senior credit facility and our ability to obtain additional indebtedness will depend on market conditions and continued improvement in our financial performance. We cannot assure you that cash generated by our operations will be sufficient to allow us to open new stores. If this cash is not allocated efficiently among our various projects, or if any of these initiatives prove to be unsuccessful, we may experience reduced cash flow and we could be required to delay, significantly curtail or eliminate planned store openings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future operating performance and the price of our Class A common stock.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLitigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide variety of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, we may be a party to individual personal injury, product liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation arising from food-related illness. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease consumer confidence in our businesses, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn February and March 2014, three purported class action lawsuits alleging the violation of the federal securities laws were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering. The actions were consolidated on June 3, 2014 under the caption In re Fairway Group Holdings Corp. Securities Litigation, No. 14-cv-0950. On July 18, 2014, an amended class action complaint was filed, adding affiliates of Sterling Investment Partners as defendants. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and alleges misleading statements in the registration statement and prospectus for our initial public offering and in subsequent communications regarding our business and financial results. On September 5, 2014, we and the other defendants moved to dismiss the amended class action complaint. On January 20, 2015, the Magistrate appointed by the district judge to whom the case was assigned to review the motions and make a recommendation to the judge recommended that our and the other defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss be granted in part and denied in part. We filed an objection to the Magistrate\u2019s recommendation. In March 2015, the district judge to whom the case was assigned notified the plaintiffs and defendants to refile the complaint and motion to dismiss in light of a recent decision of the Supreme Court. All revised filings are required to be made by June 30, 2015. Although we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously, we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nIn April 2014, a purported stockholder derivative action was filed against certain of our current and former directors in New York state court, asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement based on substantially similar allegations as in the securities class action. In June 2014, we and the other defendants moved to dismiss the derivative complaint. On July 30, 2014, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding affiliates of Sterling Investment Partners as defendants and asserting claims against them for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. On September 29, 2014, we and the other defendants moved to dismiss the amended derivative complaint. On November 10, 2014, the court granted our and the other defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the grounds that under the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation the derivative action must be brought in the State of Delaware. The plaintiffs have appealed this decision. A similar case was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court in February 2015, and we and the other defendants have moved to dismiss this case as well. Although we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits.\nIn May 2014, a purported wage and hour class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our current and former officers and employees. This suit alleged, among other things, that certain of our past and current employees were not properly compensated in accordance with the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. In May 2015, we agreed in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the matter without material financial consequence.\nMonitoring and defending against legal actions, whether or not meritorious, is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities and we cannot predict how long it may take to resolve these matters. In addition, legal fees and costs incurred in connection with such activities may be significant and we could, in the future, be subject to judgments or enter into settlements of claims for significant monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions or resulting from these matters could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position.\nWith respect to any litigation, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for the expenses or losses we may suffer in contesting and concluding such lawsuits. Substantial litigation costs or an adverse result in any litigation may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIncreased commodity prices and availability may impact profitability.\nMany of our products include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, sugar, cocoa and other commodities. Although commodity price inputs do not typically represent the substantial majority of our product costs, any increase in commodity prices may cause our vendors to seek price increases from us. Although we typically are able to mitigate vendor efforts to increase our costs, we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmay be unable to continue to do so, either in whole or in part. In the event we are unable to continue mitigating potential vendor price increases, we may in turn consider raising our prices, and our customers may be deterred by any such price increases. Our profitability may be impacted through increased costs to us which may impact gross margins, or through reduced revenue as a result of a decline in the number and average size of customer transactions.\nSevere weather, natural disasters and adverse climate changes may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather conditions and other natural disasters in areas where we have stores or from which we obtain the products we sell may materially adversely affect our retail operations or our product offerings and, therefore, our results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to, or temporary or permanent closure of, one or more of our stores, an insufficient work force in our markets and/or temporary disruption in the supply of products, including delays in the delivery of goods to our stores or a reduction in the availability of products in our stores. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops may materially adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within our supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt our businesses and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor example, we temporarily closed all of our stores as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which struck the Greater New York City metropolitan area on October 29, 2012. While all but one of our stores were able to reopen within a day or two following the storm, we experienced business disruptions due to inventory delays as a result of transportation issues, loss of electricity at certain of our locations and the inability of some of our employees to travel to work due to transportation issues. In addition, our Red Hook store suffered substantial damage, including the loss of all inventory and a substantial portion of its equipment, and it was not reopened until March 1, 2013. The closure of this store impacted our operating results in fiscal 2013 due to lost revenue, pre and post-storm stock up and absorbed market share from competitors who were not immediately operational subsequent to the storm, and the fact that we retained substantially all of the employees of that store.\nThe occurrence of a widespread health epidemic may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be severely impacted by wartime activities, threats or acts of terror or a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic, such as pandemic flu. Such activities, threats or epidemics may materially adversely impact our business by disrupting production and delivery of products to our stores, by affecting our ability to appropriately staff our stores and by causing customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise change their shopping behaviors.\nProposed changes to financial accounting standards could require our store leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.\nIn addition to our significant level of indebtedness, we have significant obligations relating to our current operating leases. Proposed changes to financial accounting standards could require such leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. All of our existing stores are subject to leases, which have remaining terms of up to 25 years, and as of March 29, 2015, we had undiscounted operating lease commitments of approximately $780.7 million, scheduled through 2039, related primarily to our stores and our production center, which is in our possession but not yet open. These commitments represent the minimum lease payments due under our operating leases, excluding common area maintenance, insurance and taxes related to our operating lease obligations, and do not reflect fair market value rent reset provisions in the leases. These leases are classified as operating leases and disclosed in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, but are not reflected as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2015, our cash operating lease expense was approximately $34.6 million.\nIn May 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d) issued a revised joint discussion paper highlighting proposed changes to financial accounting standards for leases. Currently, Accounting Standards Codification 840 (\u201cASC 840\u201d), Leases (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 13, Accounting for Leases) requires that operating leases are classified as an off-balance sheet transaction and only the current year operating lease expense is accounted for in the income statement. In order to determine the proper classification of our stores as either operating leases or capital leases, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease. All of our store leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases. Additionally, operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, which means that neither a leased asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The proposed changes to ASC 840 would require that substantially all operating leases be recognized as assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. The right to use the leased property would be capitalized as an asset and the expected lease payments\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nover the life of the lease would be accounted for as a liability. The effective date, which has not been determined, could be as early as 2016 and may require retrospective adoption. While we have not quantified the impact this proposed standard would have on our financial statements, if our current operating leases are instead recognized on the balance sheet, it will result in a significant increase in the liabilities reflected on our balance sheet and in the interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense reflected in our income statement, while reducing the amount of rent expense. This could potentially decrease our net income.\nOur high level of fixed lease obligations could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur high level of fixed lease obligations will require us to use a significant portion of cash generated by our operations to satisfy these obligations, and could adversely impact our ability to obtain future financing to support our growth or other operational investments. We will require substantial cash flows from operations to make our payments under our operating leases, all of which provide for periodic increases in rent. If we are not able to make the required payments under the leases, the lenders or owners of the stores may, among other things, repossess those assets, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, our failure to make payments under our operating leases could trigger defaults under other leases or under agreements governing our indebtedness, which could cause the counterparties under those agreements to accelerate the obligations due thereunder. Certain of our leases are with entities affiliated with one of our directors who formerly also was an executive officer. See \u201c-We lease certain of our stores and other properties from a related party\u201d.\nIf our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill. As of March 29, 2015, we had goodwill of approximately $95.4 million, which represented approximately 26.6% of our total assets as of such date. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter (at the end of each fiscal year prior to fiscal 2014) or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. To the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we are required to perform a second step, as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired. In this step, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Based on this annual impairment analysis, there was no impairment of non-amortizable intangible assets, including goodwill, as of March 31, 2013, March 30, 2014 and March 29, 2015. See \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\u201d\nOur detailed impairment analysis involves the use of discounted cash flow models. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on existing and forecasted results. Determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires that we make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate market rates. Our judgments are based on historical experience, current market trends and other information. In estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated forecasts for operating profits and cash flows, including capital expenditures. Critical assumptions include projected comparable store sales growth, timing and number of new store openings, gross profit rates, general and administrative expenses, direct store expenses, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We determine discount rates based on the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant. Such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and considers the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective. We also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our market capitalization in performing our reporting unit valuation. Factors that could cause us to change our estimates of future cash flows include a prolonged economic crisis, successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our core markets, our inability to compete effectively with other retailers or our inability to maintain price competitiveness. We believe our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business; however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. See Note 1 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe are controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Sterling Investment Partners, whose interests in our business may be different from yours.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is publicly traded, has one vote per share. At May 15, 2015 Sterling Investment Partners owned 8,182,679 shares of Class A common stock and 13,080,655 shares of Class B common stock representing approximately 48.5% of our outstanding common stock and approximately 80.9% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As such, Sterling Investment Partners has significant influence over our reporting and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncorporate management and affairs, and, because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, Sterling Investment Partners controls a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore is able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders. Sterling Investment Partners will, for so long as the shares of Class B common stock owned by it and its permitted transferees represent at least 5% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, effectively control actions to be taken by us and our board of directors, including the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. These actions may be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. Sterling Investment Partners\u2019 control may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d will not apply to Sterling Investment Partners, or any of our directors who are associates of, or affiliated with, Sterling Investment Partners, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses. It is possible that the interests of Sterling Investment Partners and their affiliates may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you, and Sterling Investment Partners may act in a manner that advances its best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes and transfers to members of Sterling Investment Partners. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. All outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will automatically convert into a single class of common stock when Sterling Investment Partners and its permitted transferees no longer own any shares of Class B common stock.\nSterling Investment Partners is not subject to any contractual obligation to retain its controlling interest. There can be no assurance as to the period of time during which Sterling Investment Partners will in fact maintain its ownership of our common stock.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, which could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules for NASDAQ-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In light of our status as a controlled company, our board of directors has determined not to have an independent nominating function and has chosen to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board. Accordingly, should the interests of Sterling Investment Partners, as our controlling stockholder, differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nConflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors are representatives of our controlling stockholders.\nMessrs. Santoro and Barr, who are representatives of Sterling Investment Partners, serve on our board of directors, and Mr. Santoro serves as our Chairman. Sterling Investment Partners and affiliated funds may hold equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us, and companies in which they currently invest may begin competing with us. As a result of these relationships, when conflicts between the interests of Sterling Investment Partners and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the interests of our other stockholders, on the other hand, arise, these directors may not be disinterested. Although our directors and officers have a duty of loyalty to us under Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, transactions that we enter into in which a director or officer has a conflict of interest are generally permissible so long as (i) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our board of directors and a majority of our disinterested directors, or a committee consisting solely of disinterested directors, approves the transaction, (ii) the material facts relating to the director\u2019s or officer\u2019s relationship or interest as to the transaction are disclosed to our stockholders and a majority of our disinterested stockholders approves the transaction or (iii) the transaction is otherwise fair to us. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, representatives of Sterling Investment Partners are not required to offer to us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is offered to them solely in their capacity as a director of ours.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including:\n\u00b7\nvariations in our operating results, or the operating results of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our financial guidance to investors and analysts or our failure to achieve such expectations;\n\u00b7\ndelays in, or our failure to provide, financial guidance;\n\u00b7\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or our failure to achieve such estimates;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new store openings or initiatives, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nfailure of any of our initiatives to achieve commercial success;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of securities of similar companies;\n\u00b7\ngeneral market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets;\n\u00b7\nsales of large blocks of our Class A common stock, including sales by Sterling Investment Partners or by our executive officers or directors;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of any of our key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles or methodologies;\n\u00b7\neconomic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u00b7\nchanging legal or regulatory developments in the U.S.;\n\u00b7\ndiscussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor forums;\n\u00b7\nmarket rumors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in the securities class action and stockholder derivative litigation pending against us; and\n\u00b7\nnegative publicity about us in the media and online.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock. We are currently, and may in the future become, involved in this type of litigation. Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our business. See \u201c-Risks Relating to Our Business - Litigation May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than you paid.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the market price of our Class A common stock increases. In addition, our senior credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe price of our Class A common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our Class A common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders, or when there is a large number of shares of our Class A common stock available for sale. These sales, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAt May 15, 2015, 43,822,335 shares of our common stock were outstanding, substantially all of which are freely tradable. A large portion of our shares are held by Sterling Investment Partners, which has rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they and certain of our other existing stockholders currently hold, or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAlso, in the future, we may issue shares of our Class A common stock in connection with investments or acquisitions or to finance our growth. The amount of shares of our Class A common stock issued for such purposes could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of common stock.\nThe market price of the shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of Class A common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly and our current operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results could affect our stock price in the future.\nOur operating results have historically varied from period-to-period, and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our forecasts of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our Class A common stock price could be negatively affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance.\nFactors associated with our industry, the operation of our business and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase sales and same store sales;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain or improve our operating margins;\n\u00b7\nour ability to compete effectively with other retailers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain price competitiveness;\n\u00b7\nongoing economic uncertainty;\n\u00b7\nnegative effects to our reputation from real or perceived quality or health issues with our food products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our centralized production facility;\n\u00b7\nour ability to satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements;\n\u00b7\nrising costs of providing employee benefits, including increased healthcare costs and pension contributions due to unfunded pension liabilities;\n\u00b7\nordering errors or product supply disruptions in the delivery of perishable products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to open new stores on a timely basis or at all;\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve sustained sales and profitable operating margins at new stores;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of financing to pursue our new store openings on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of our information technology or administrative systems to perform as anticipated;\n\u00b7\ndata security breaches and the release of confidential customer or employee information;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain and attract senior management, key employees and qualified store-level employees;\n\u00b7\nour ability to renegotiate expiring collective bargaining agreements and new collective bargaining agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe geographic concentration of our stores;\n\u00b7\nour history of net losses;\n\u00b7\nadditional indebtedness incurred in the future;\n\u00b7\nour high level of fixed lease obligations;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on our use of the Fairway name other than on the East Coast and in California and certain parts of Michigan and Ohio;\n\u00b7\nour ability to protect or maintain our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nchanges in law;\n\u00b7\nclaims made against us resulting in litigation, and the costs of defending, and adverse developments in, such litigation;\n\u00b7\nour ability to defend the purported securities class action and derivative lawsuits filed against us and other similar complaints that may be brought in the future, in a timely manner and within the coverage, scope and limits of our insurance policies;\n\u00b7\nincreases in commodity prices;\n\u00b7\nsevere weather and other natural disasters in areas in which we have stores, warehouses and/or production facilities;\n\u00b7\nwartime activities, threats or acts of terror or a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic;\n\u00b7\nchanges to financial accounting standards regarding store leases;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of our goodwill; and\n\u00b7\nother factors discussed under \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAny one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results, including fluctuations in our key metrics. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term.\nThe supervoting rights of our Class B common stock and other anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay attempts to acquire us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u00b7\nany transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;\n\u00b7\nwe have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Sterling Investment Partners with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u00b7\nwhen we no longer have outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u00b7\nwhen we no longer have outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause;\n\u00b7\nwhen we no longer have outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u00b7\nonly our chairman or a majority of our board of directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u00b7\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; and\n\u00b7\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of certain stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nPrior to our initial public offering in April 2013, we were not required to comply with the SEC rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and were therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. Although we are now required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting, as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nformally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. In addition, when evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are relying on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Accordingly, we have included detailed compensation information for only our three most highly compensated executive officers and have not included a compensation discussion and analysis (CD&A) of our executive compensation programs in this report. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:\n\u00b7\nhave an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u00b7\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u00b7\nsubmit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden parachutes\u201d; and\n\u00b7\ndisclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO\u2019s compensation to median employee compensation.\nIn addition, while we are an emerging growth company the JOBS Act will permit us to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public and private companies until such pronouncements become mandatory for private companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public and private companies.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) our reporting $1 billion or more in annual gross revenues; (ii) the end of fiscal 2019; (iii) our issuance, in a three year period, of more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOperating as a public company has increased our general and administrative costs, and our management will be required to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to public company requirements.\nUntil April 2013, we operated as a private company. As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are required to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Market and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Market, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In that regard, we plan to support the internal audit function with a combination of in-house and outside resources to ensure that we deploy resources with the appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. We may not be successful in implementing these requirements, and implementing them could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we do not implement or comply with such requirements in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action could harm our reputation and the confidence of investors and customers in our company, and could materially adversely affect our business and cause our Class A common stock price to decline. We also expect that operating as a public company will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.", "PERMNO": 13874, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "FWMHQ"}
