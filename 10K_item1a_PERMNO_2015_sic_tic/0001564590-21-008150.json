{"cik": "9092", "company": "BADGER METER INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nShareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider the significant business risks described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the front of this 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The following list of risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment, and new risk factors may emerge from time to time. We can neither predict these new risk factors with certainty nor assess the precise impact, if any, on our business, or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may adversely impact our results of operations. While there is much uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften their potential impact when and if possible.\nPRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES\nThe inability to develop technologically advanced products could harm our future success.\nWe believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Although we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area, maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage. If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our future financial performance may be adversely affected. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards, technologies or new products that could render our existing products obsolete in the near term. Our radios operate on networks which are changing as part of the natural evolution of technology. The pace of that change is largely outside of the Company\u2019s control and the sun-setting of a network may have an adverse impact on the Company. The municipal water industry is continuing to see the adoption of static water meters. Static water metering has lower barriers to entry that could affect the competitive landscape in North America. We believe we have a competitive product. If the adoption rate for static meters were to accelerate, we believe competitors lack brand recognition and product breadth and do not have extensive water utility channel distribution to effectively reach the more than 50,000 water utilities in the United States.\nFailure to manufacture quality products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards. Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential. Although we believe our products are perceived as high quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products could seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to\nour ability to attract new customers. In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products or incur warranty related expenses. A successful claim brought against us with respect to a defective product in excess of available insurance coverage, if any, or a requirement to participate in a major product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe sell and install software products, including some that are provided in \u201cthe cloud,\u201d that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer. A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products or a failure or breach of a cloud network could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur expanded role as a prime contractor brings certain risks that could have a material adverse effect to our business.\nThe Company periodically assumes the role of prime contractor for providing complete technology systems, installation and other services and project management to governmental entities, which brings with it added risks, including but not limited to, our responsibility for managing subcontractor performance and project timelines and the potential for expanded warranty and performance obligations. While we have managed a number of these types of arrangements, it is possible to encounter a situation where we may not be able to perform to the expectations of the governmental entity, and thus incur additional costs that could affect our profitability or harm our reputation.\nIf we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our software and related products, our ability to market our software products could be hindered and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and software products and other components may increasingly be subject to third-party infringement claims. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nBUSINESS CONDITIONS\nThe global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, or other global public health pandemics, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if a global public health pandemic, including the current global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, interferes with the ability of our employees, suppliers, and customers to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business and operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world, and it could have a material negative impact on our business and operations in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below:\n\u2022\nThe risk that we, or our employees, suppliers or customers may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.\n\u2022\nRestrictions on shipping products from certain jurisdictions where they are produced or into certain jurisdictions where customers are located.\n\u2022\nInability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements, such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability.\n\u2022\nFailure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations.\n\u2022\nSignificant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand and a global economic recession that could further reduce demand for our products, resulting from actions taken by governments, businesses, and/or the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and spreading of such infectious diseases, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, and business shutdowns or slowdowns.\n\u2022\nDeterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.\n\u2022\nActions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or other outbreaks of disease or similar public health threats, materially and adversely impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments. Such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease, the development and timeline of an effective and broadly available vaccine and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak. In addition, how quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating conditions can resume cannot be predicted, and the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers, third-party service providers, and/or customers.\nThe inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts at favorable prices could decrease our profit margins and negatively impact timely delivery to customers.\nWe are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials and component parts, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process. The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers. In the past, we have been able to offset price increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in the production processes. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future. Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by an interruption in the production or transportation of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control. World commodity markets and inflation may also affect raw material and component part prices. In addition, we rely on single suppliers for microprocessors, castings and components in several of our product lines and the loss of such suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term.\nEconomic conditions could cause a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results.\nAs a supplier of products and software, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy, and the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, public and private water companies and numerous smaller water utilities. These customers may delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, or may not have the ability to authorize and finance purchases during economic downturns or instability in world markets. We also sell products for other applications to reduce our dependency on the municipal water market. A significant downturn in this market could cause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results. Therefore, a downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in the municipal water market, and delays in the timing or amounts of possible annual federal funding and periodic stimulus fund programs, government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations, or the availability of funds to municipalities could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm the business.\nGeopolitical crisis, including terrorism or pandemics, could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are susceptible to global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, and widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition. See the separate risk factor specific to the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nRisks related to foreign markets could decrease our profitability.\nSince we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. These risks include such things as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in political or economic conditions of specific countries or regions, potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread operations.\nAn inability to attract and retain skilled employees could negatively impact our growth and decrease our profitability.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our organization. Current and future compensation arrangements, including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our growth.\nCompetitive pressures in the marketplace could decrease our revenues and profits.\nCompetitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. We operate in an environment where competition varies from moderate to strong and a number of our competitors have greater financial resources. Our competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products. The principal elements of competition for our most significant product applications, residential and commercial water meters for the municipal water utility market (with various radio technology systems), are price, product technology, quality and service. The competitive environment is also affected by the movement toward radio technologies and away from manually read meters, the demand for replacement units and, to some extent, such things as global economic conditions, the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus programs, the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall economic activity. For our flow instrumentation products, the competitive environment is affected by the general economic health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United States and Europe.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nViolations or alleged violations of laws that impose requirements for the conduct of the Company\u2019s overseas operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions and sanctioned parties restrictions could adversely affect our business.\nIn foreign countries where we operate, a risk exists that our employees, third party partners or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by applicable laws and regulations, such as the FCPA. Such anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments to foreign officials, require companies to keep accurate books and records, and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance. However, we operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption, and, in certain circumstances, local customs and practice might not be consistent with the requirements of anti-corruption laws. We remain subject to the risk that our employees, third party partners or agents will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and violate such laws and regulations. Violations by us or a third party acting on our behalf could result in significant internal investigation costs and legal fees, civil and criminal penalties, including prohibitions on the conduct of our business and reputational harm.\nWe may also be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we violate U.S. trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the European Union, the United Nations and trade sanction laws, such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. Our policies mandate strict compliance with such laws and we devote resources to ensure compliance.\nChanges in environmental or regulatory requirements could entail additional expenses that could decrease our profitability.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in various countries and markets, such as those regulating lead or other material content in certain of our products, the handling, recycling and disposal of certain electronic and other materials, the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products, data privacy and protection, as well as customs and trade practices. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted. Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included as part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material effect on our business or financial position, but a change in the future could adversely affect our profitability.\nGENERAL\nEconomic impacts due to leadership or policy changes in the countries where we do business could negatively affect our profitability.\nWe may be affected by adjustments to economic and trade policies, such as taxation, changes to or withdrawal from international trade agreements, or the like, when countries where we produce or sell our products change leadership or economic policies. These types of changes, as well as any related regulatory changes, could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nGlobal and regional economic and political conditions could adversely affect our business.\nIn June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), and the United Kingdom officially withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020. On December 30, 2020, the European Union and the United Kingdom entered into an agreement regarding their future relationship (EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement), which provisionally applies until February 28, 2021, by which date it is expected to be fully ratified by all the parties. Despite this development, Brexit continues to be the source of significant economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, which may negatively impact our business results in those regions. In addition, changes related to Brexit could result in disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and additional legal, political and economic uncertainty, all of which could potentially disrupt the markets we serve, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nClimate change, unusual weather and other natural phenomena could adversely affect our business.\nClimate changes and weather conditions may affect, or cause volatility in, our financial results. Drought conditions could drive higher demand for smart water solutions that advance conservation efforts in residential and commercial applications. Our sales also may be adversely affected by unusual weather, weather patterns or other natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time. The unpredictable nature of weather conditions and climate change therefore may result in volatility for certain portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers.\nLitigation against us could be costly, time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our profitability.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.\nDisruptions and other damages to our information technology and other networks and operations, and breaches in data security or cybersecurity attacks could have a negative financial impact and damage our reputation.\nOur ability to serve customers, as well as increase revenues and control costs, depends in part on the reliability of our sophisticated technologies, system networks and cloud-based software. We use information technology and other systems to manage our business in order to maximize our revenue, effectiveness and efficiency. Unauthorized parties gaining access to digital systems and networks for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive financial, personal or business information, corrupting data, causing operational disruptions and other cyber-related risks could adversely impact our customer relationships, business plans and our reputation. In some cases, we are dependent on third-party technologies and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability or through which hackers could gain access to sensitive and/or personal information. These potential disruptions and cyber-attacks could negatively affect revenues, costs, customer demand, system availability and our reputation.\nFurther, as the Company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue newer technologies that improve our operations and cost structure, the Company is also expanding and improving its information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. Certain new technologies present new and significant cybersecurity safety risks that must be analyzed and addressed before implementation. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks.\nFailure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquired businesses or products could adversely affect our operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits. There can be no assurance that we will identify or complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, legal, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits. If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted. Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 53110, "SIC": 3824, "TIC": "BMI"}
