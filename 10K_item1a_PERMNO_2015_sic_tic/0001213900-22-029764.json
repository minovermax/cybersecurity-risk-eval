{"cik": "1708341", "company": "Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the specific risks described below before making an investment decision. Any of the risks we describe below could cause our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects to be materially adversely affected.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects. Amounts within the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section are stated in thousands with the exception of share information.\nAllied Esports Risk Factors\nAllied Esports is subject to risks associated with operating in a rapidly developing industry and a relatively new market.\nMany elements of Allied Esports\u2019 business are unique, evolving and relatively unproven. Its business and prospects depend on the continuing development of live streaming of competitive esports gaming. The market for esports gaming competition is relatively new and rapidly developing and is subject to significant challenges. Allied Esports\u2019 business relies upon its ability to grow and garner an active gamer community, and successfully monetize this community through tournament fees, live event ticket sales, and advertising and sponsorships. In addition, Allied Esports\u2019 continued growth depends, in part, on its ability to respond to constant changes in the esports gaming industry, including technological evolution, shifts in gamer trends and demands, introductions of new games, game publisher intellectual property right practices, and industry standards and practices. While change in this industry may be inevitable, and Allied Esports will try to adapt its business model as needed to accommodate change and remain on the forefront of its competitors, Allied Esports may be unsuccessful in doing so and does not provide any guarantees or assurances of success as the industry continues to evolve.\nAllied Esports may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability.\nAllied Esports expects its operating expenses to increase significantly as it continues to expand its marketing efforts and operations in existing and new geographies and vertical markets (including its online esports tournament and gaming subscription platform it intends to develop). In addition, Allied Esports expects to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses related to being a public company. If its revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than these increases in operating expenses, it will not be able to achieve profitability in future periods. As a result, Allied Esports may generate losses. Allied Esports cannot assure you that it will achieve profitability.\nAllied Esports generates a portion of its revenues from advertising and sponsorship. If it fails to attract more advertisers and sponsors to its live events, tournaments or content, or if advertisers or sponsors are less willing to advertise with or sponsor Allied Esports, its revenues may be adversely affected.\nAllied Esports generates revenue from advertising and sponsorship, and it expects to further develop and expand its focus on these revenues in the future. These revenues partly depend on the advertisers\u2019 willingness to advertise in the esports gaming industry. If the esports gaming advertising and sponsorship market does not continue to grow, or if Allied Esports is unable to capture and retain a sufficient share of that market, Allied Esports\u2019 ability to achieve profitability may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, with unfavorable economic external factors, sponsors and advertisers may not have enough budget allocations for spending in sponsorship and advertising in esports, which would also lead to an adverse impact on Allied Esports\u2019 revenue stream.\nAllied Esports\u2019 business model may not remain effective and it cannot guarantee that its future monetization strategies will be successfully implemented or generate sustainable revenues and profit.\nAllied Esports generates revenues from advertising and sponsorship of its live events, its content, the sale of merchandising, and the operation of its esports arenas. Allied Esports has generated, and expects to continue to generate, a substantial portion of revenues using this revenue model in the near term. Although Allied Esports anticipates growth in Allied Esports\u2019 business utilizing this revenue model, there is no guarantee that growth will continue in the future, and the demand for its offerings may change, decrease substantially or dissipate, or it may fail to anticipate and serve esports gamer demands effectively. The COVID-19 outbreak may also continue to cause the demand for our in-person events to reduce and shift demand to online gaming. Allied Esports may determine to enter into new opportunities to expand its business, including online gaming platforms, which may or may not be successful. Any such expansions involve additional risks and costs that could materially and adversely affect its business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the long-term growth plans of Allied Esports, and we may not be able to implement and grow our three-pillar objectives for long-term success in the near future, or even at all.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption in our long-term growth plans for Allied Esports, and although our long-term strategy remains to fully implement the three-pillar strategy, we are currently focused on continuing our in-person experiences at our current arenas and developing multiplatform content. There is no guarantee that we will be able in the near future or at any point to be able to expand our in-person experience to arenas beyond those in which we are currently operating or develop an esports platform.\nWe hold and may acquire digital assets that are subject to volatile market prices, impairment and unique risks of loss.\nIn March 2022, we initiated a roadmap to increase participation and enhance user experiences in our Allied Esports community. As part of the program, we minted our own non-fungible tokens (\u201cNFTs\u201d) and linked them to digital art that we own, license, or otherwise have the right to use. We accepted ether for the NFTs as a form of payment, and may accept ether for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws. We may hold or sell the ether upon receipt.\nThe prices of digital assets have been in the past and may continue to be highly volatile due to various associated risks and uncertainties. For example, the prevalence of such assets is a relatively recent trend, and their long-term adoption by investors, consumers, and businesses is unpredictable. Moreover, their lack of a physical form, their reliance on technology for their creation, existence and transactional validation and their decentralization may subject their integrity to the threat of malicious attacks and technological obsolescence. If we hold digital assets and their values decrease relative to our purchase prices, our financial condition may be harmed.\nMoreover, digital assets are currently considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges, whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale, which may adversely affect our operating results in any period in which such impairment occurs. There is no guarantee that future changes in GAAP will not require us to change the way we account for digital assets held by us.\nDigital assets, as intangible assets without centralized issuers or governing bodies, have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, cyberattacks or other malicious activities, as well as human errors or computer malfunctions that may result in the loss or destruction of private keys needed to access such assets. While we intend to take all reasonable measures to secure any digital assets, if such threats are realized or the measures or controls we create or implement to secure our digital assets fail, it could result in a partial or total misappropriation or loss of our digital assets, and our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nAt this time, the regulation of digital assets and NFTs remains in an early stage. The extent to which securities laws or other regulations apply or may apply in the future to such assets is unclear at this time. However, on March 9, 2022, the White House issued an Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets proposing, among other things, regulation of digital assets. Future regulation of such assets may increase our compliance costs or adversely impact our business.\nAllied Esports\u2019 long-term growth strategy depends on the availability of suitable locations for its proprietary and licensed esports arenas and its ability to open new locations and operate them profitably.\nA key element of Allied Esports\u2019 long-term growth strategy is to extend its brand by opening additional flagship arenas throughout the world and licensing the Allied Esports brand to third party esports arena operators, which it believes will provide attractive returns on investment. However, desirable locations may not be available at an acceptable cost. Opening these additional locations will depend upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond Allied Esports\u2019 control, including its ability or the ability of the selected licensee to:\n\u25cf reach acceptable agreements regarding the lease of the locations;\n\u25cf comply with applicable zoning, licensing, land use and environmental regulations and orders (including those related to social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u25cf raise or have available an adequate amount of cash or currently available financing for construction and opening costs;\n\u25cf timely hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u25cf negotiate acceptable terms with any unions representing employees;\n\u25cf obtain, for acceptable cost, required permits and approvals, including liquor licenses; and\n\u25cf efficiently manage the amount of time and money used to build and open each new location.\nIf Allied Esports succeeds in opening new arenas on a timely and cost-effective basis, it may nonetheless be unable to attract enough gamers or spectators to the new location (or to existing locations of affiliated arenas) because its entertainment and menu options might not appeal to them. Failure to do so could have a significant adverse effect on Allied Esports\u2019 overall operating results.\nAllied Esports has not entered into definitive license agreements with all game publishers that it currently has relationships with, and it may never do so.\nAlthough Allied Esports has relationships with many game publishers for tournament event and content experiences involving their respective intellectual properties and enters into definitive license agreements with such game publishers from time to time, Allied Esports does not have definitive license agreements in place with all of its game publishers. No assurances can be given as to when or if it will be able to come to agreeable terms with game publishers for any future license agreements. If Allied Esports is unable to come to mutually agreeable terms and enter into definitive license agreements with game publishers, game publishers may unilaterally choose to discontinue its relationship with Allied Esports, thereby preventing Allied Esports from offering tournament event and content experiences using their game intellectual property. Should game publishers choose not to allow Allied Esports to offer tournament event and content experiences involving their intellectual property to Allied Esports\u2019 customers, the popularity of Allied Esports\u2019 tournaments and content may decline, which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nEven if Allied Esports is able to license its brand to third party esports operators, there is a risk that those operators could damage its brand by operating esports arenas that are not at Allied Esports\u2019 standards of operation.\nAs Allied Esports licenses the Allied Esports brand to third party esports arena operators around the world, it will depend on those operators to run those arenas at a quality level similar to Allied Esports\u2019 owned and operated arenas. Allied Esports\u2019 strategy depends on customers associating the third party esports arenas as part of Allied Esports\u2019 network of affiliated arenas, which it believes will expand its brand recognition and increase customers, revenue, and growth. If Allied Esports\u2019 affiliate arenas are poorly operated, or if those operators fail to use Allied Esports\u2019 name and branding in a manner consistent with Allied Esports\u2019 corporate messaging and branding, or if there are safety issues or other negative occurrences at affiliate arenas, Allied Esports\u2019 name and brand could be significantly damaged, which would make its expansion difficult and materially adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nAllied Esports\u2019 long-term growth strategy includes deploying additional mobile arenas in the U.S. and Europe to host its tournaments and events and it must operate them profitably.\nA key element of Allied Esports\u2019 long-term growth strategy is to extend its brand by increasing and adding to its portfolio of mobile arenas in the U.S. and Europe, as we believe doing so will provide attractive returns on investment. Adding these mobile arenas will depend upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond Allied Esports\u2019 control, including but not limited to our ability, or the ability of our licensees, to:\n\u25cf reach acceptable agreements regarding the lease or acquisition of the trucks that are the basis of the mobile arenas;\n\u25cf comply with applicable zoning, licensing, land use and environmental regulations and orders (including those related to social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic) and obtain required permits and approvals;\n\u25cf raise or have available an adequate amount of cash or currently available financing for construction of the mobile arenas and the related operational costs;\n\u25cf timely hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to operate the mobile arenas;\n\u25cf efficiently manage the amount of time and money used to build and operate each new mobile arena; and\n\u25cf manage the risks of road hazards, accidents, traffic violations, etc. that may impede the operations of the mobile arenas.\nThe nature of hosting esports events exposes Allied Esports to negative publicity or customer complaints, including in relation to, among other things, accidents, injuries or thefts at the arenas, and health and safety concerns.\nAllied Esports\u2019 business of hosting esports events inherently exposes it to negative publicity or customer complaints as a result of accidents, injuries or, in extreme cases, deaths arising from incidents occurring at our arenas, including health, safety or security issues, and quality and service standards. Even isolated or sporadic incidents or accidents may have a negative impact on Allied Esports\u2019 brand image and reputation, the arenas\u2019 popularity with gamers and spectators or the ability to host esports events at all.\nAllied Esports\u2019 marketing and advertising efforts may fail to resonate with gamers.\nAllied Esports\u2019 live events, tournaments and competitions are marketed through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as online and mobile advertising, marketing through websites, event sponsorship and direct communications with the esports gaming community including via email, blogs and other electronic means. An increasing portion of Allied Esports\u2019 marketing activity is taking place on social media platforms that are either outside, or not totally within, its direct control. Changes to gamer preferences, marketing regulations, privacy and data protection laws, technology changes or service disruptions may negatively impact its ability to reach target gamers. Allied Esports\u2019 ability to market its tournaments and competitions is dependent in part upon the success of these programs.\nThe esports gaming industry is competitive, and gamers may prefer competitors\u2019 arenas, leagues, competitions or tournaments over those offered by Allied Esports.\nThe esports gaming industry is competitive. Competitors range from established leagues and championships owned directly, as well as leagues franchised by well-known and capitalized game publishers and developers, interactive entertainment companies, diversified media companies and emerging start-ups. New competitors will likely continue to emerge. Many of these competitors may have greater financial resources than Allied Esports. If Allied Esports\u2019 competitors develop and launch competing arenas, leagues, tournaments or competitions, Allied Esports\u2019 revenue and margins could decline.\nAllied Esports may not provide events or tournaments with games or titles for which the esports gaming community is interested.\nAllied Esports must attract and retain the popular esports gaming titles in order to maintain and increase the popularity of its live events, leagues, tournaments and competitions. Allied Esports must identify and license popular games that resonate with the esports gamer community on an ongoing basis. Allied Esports cannot assure you that it can attract and license popular esports games from their publishers, and failure to do so would have a material and adverse impact on Allied Esports\u2019 results of operations and financial conditions.\nIf Allied Esports fails to keep its existing gamers engaged, acquire new gamers and expand interest in its live events, leagues, tournaments and competitions, its business, its ability to achieve profitability and its prospects may be adversely affected.\nAllied Esports\u2019 success depends on its ability to maintain and grow the number of gamers attending its live events, tournaments and competitions, and keep its gamers and attendees highly engaged. In order to attract, retain and engage gamers and remain competitive, Allied Esports must continue to develop and expand its live events, leagues, produce engaging tournaments and competitions, and implement new content formats, technologies and strategies to improve its product offerings. There is no assurance it will be able to do so.\nA decline in the number of gamers may adversely affect the engagement level of gamers with Allied Esports\u2019 tournament and entertainment platform under development may reduce our revenue opportunities and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is vital to Allied Esports\u2019 operations that its planned online esports tournament and gaming subscriptions platform be responsive to evolving gamer preferences and offer first-tier esports game content and other services that attracts gamers. Allied Esports must also keep providing gamers new features and functions to enable superior content viewing and interaction, or the number of gamers utilizing the platform will likely decline. Any decline in the number of gamers will likely have a material and adverse effect on our operations.\nThere is no guarantee that Allied Esports will be able to complete its planned online esports tournament and gaming subscription platform, or that such platform once completed will be or remain popular.\nAllied Esports cannot assure you that the online esports tournament and gaming subscription platform it intends to develop will be completed in a timely manner or, if completed, become popular with gamers to offset the costs incurred to operate and expand it. This will require substantial costs and expenses. If such increased costs and expenses do not effectively translate into improved gamer engagement, Allied Esports\u2019 results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf Allied Esports fails to maintain and enhance its brands, its business, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nAllied Esports believes that maintaining and enhancing its brands is important for its business to succeed by increasing the number of gamers and engagement by the esports community. Since Allied Esports operates in a highly competitive market, brand maintenance and enhancement directly affects its ability to maintain and enhance its market position. As Allied Esports expands, it may conduct various marketing and brand promotion activities using various methods to continue promoting its brands, but it cannot assure you that these activities will be successful. In addition, negative publicity, regardless of its veracity, could harm Allied Esports\u2019 brands and reputation, which may materially and adversely affect Allied Esports\u2019 business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf Allied Esports fails to anticipate and successfully implement new esports technologies or adopt new business strategies, technologies or methods, its business may suffer.\nRapid technology changes in the esports gaming market requires Allied Esports to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies it must develop, implement and take advantage of in order to be and remain competitive in the esports gaming market. Allied Esports has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies including its to-be-developed online esports tournament and entertainment subscription platform, technologies, products, or games to engage a growing number of gamers and deliver the best gaming experiences possible. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the technology it adopts and the features it pursues will be successful. If Allied Esports does not successfully implement these new technologies, its reputation may be materially adversely affected and its financial condition and operating results may be impacted.\nAllied Esports uses third-party services in connection with its business, and any disruption to these services could result in a disruption to its business, negative publicity and a slowdown in the growth of its users, materially and adversely affecting its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAllied Esports\u2019 business depends on services provided by, and relationships with, various third parties, including cloud hosting, server operators, broadband providers, and computing peripheral suppliers, among others. The failure of any of these parties to perform in compliance with our agreements may negatively impact Allied Esports\u2019 business.\nAdditionally, if such third parties increase their prices, fail to provide their services effectively, terminate their service or agreements or discontinue their relationships with Allied Esports, Allied Esports could suffer service interruptions, reduced revenues, or increased costs, any of which may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAllied Esports may not be able to procure the necessary permits and licenses to operate its arenas.\nAllied Esports must obtain certain permits and licenses, including liquor licenses, to operate its arenas. Often these processes can be expensive and time consuming. There is no guarantee that Allied Esports will be able to obtain such permits and licenses on a timely or cost-effective basis. Any delays could jeopardize the ability of Allied Esports to operate the arenas and host events. As a result, Allied Esports\u2019 business could suffer.\nRules and regulations governing sweepstakes, promotions and giveaways vary by state and country and these rules and regulations could restrict or eliminate Allied Esports\u2019 ability to generate revenues on its esports gaming platform it intends to develop, which could materially and adversely impact the viability of this business.\nAs part of its esports gaming platform to be developed, Allied Esports intends to offer subscribers the chance to win cash and prizes when playing esports games and tournaments on the platform. Awarding cash and prizes would require compliance with the laws or regulations in various states or countries over sweepstakes, promotions and giveaways, which are complex and constantly changing. Any negative finding of law regarding the characterization of the type of online activity carried out on the esports gaming platform could limit or prevent Allied Esports\u2019 ability to obtain subscribers in those jurisdictions, which in turn could significantly impact Allied Esports\u2019 ability to generate revenue. The ability or willingness to work with Allied Esports by payment processors and other service providers necessary to conduct the esports gaming platform business also may be limited due to such changes in laws or any perceived negative consequences of engaging in the business of sweepstakes, promotions and giveaways that will be utilized by the esports gaming platform.\nNegotiations with unionized employees could delay opening or operating Allied Esports\u2019 arenas.\nCertain of Allied Esports\u2019 employees are represented by one or more unions. Allied Esports will need to engage such unions to seek to employ the services of the employees on mutually acceptable terms. However, Allied Esports cannot guarantee that such negotiations will be timely concluded to avoid interruption in its tournament schedule, or that such negotiations will ultimately result in an agreement. Any failure to timely conclude the negotiations could cause a delay in Allied Esports\u2019 ability to timely open arenas or host events. Either of these events would adversely affect Allied Esports\u2019 ability to achieve profitability.\nAllied Esports\u2019 business is subject to regulation, and changes in applicable regulations may negatively impact its business.\nAllied Esports is subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. In addition, laws and regulations relating to user privacy, data collection, retention, electronic commerce, consumer protection, content, advertising, localization, and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many jurisdictions and countries throughout the world. These laws could harm Allied Esports\u2019 business by limiting the products and services it can offer consumers or the manner in which it offers them. The compliance costs for these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, Allied Esports\u2019 failure to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm its business and result in penalties or significant legal liability.\nAllied Esports has historically operated at a net loss on a consolidated basis, and there is no guarantee that that it will be able to be profitable.\nThe historical operations of Allied Esports have resulted in net losses from continuing operations of $15.1 million and $45.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not know with any degree of certainty whether or when the consolidated operations of Allied Esports will become profitable. Even if we are able to achieve profitability in future periods, we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability in successive periods.\nWe have formulated our business plans and strategies based on certain assumptions regarding the acceptance of our business model and the marketing of our products and services. Nevertheless, our assessments regarding market size, market share, market acceptance of our products and services and a variety of other factors may prove incorrect. Our future success will depend upon many factors, including factors beyond our control and those that cannot be predicted at this time.\nForecasts of our market and market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, there can be no assurance that our business will grow at similar rates, or at all.\nGrowth forecasts included in SEC filings relating to our market opportunities and the expected growth in those markets are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may prove to be inaccurate. We also plan to operate in a number of foreign markets, and a downturn in any of those markets could have a significant adverse effect on our businesses. Even if these markets meet our size estimate and experiences the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at a similar rate, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or legal or regulatory requirements in one or multiple jurisdictions could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us.\nAllied Esports has implemented various features intended to better comply with applicable privacy and security requirements in the collection and use of customer data, but these features do not ensure compliance and may not be effective against all potential privacy and data security concerns. A wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, disposal and other processing of personal data. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect any personal data, could result in enforcement actions against us, including fines, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial performance and prospects.\nEvolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information within the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), the United States and elsewhere may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business. In jurisdictions outside of the United States, we may face data protection and privacy requirements that are more stringent than those in place in the United States. We are at risk of enforcement actions taken by certain EU data protection authorities until such point in time that we may be able to ensure that all transfers of personal data to us in the United States from the EU are conducted in compliance with all applicable regulatory obligations, the guidance of data protection authorities and evolving best practices. The European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) may impose additional obligations, costs and risks upon our business. The GDPR may increase substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial expense in complying with the obligations imposed by the GDPR and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall.\nLoss, retention or misuse of certain information and alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose us to potential liability and may require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to and defending such allegations and claims. In addition, future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect, use or disclose data relating to individuals, which could increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue.\nAllied Esports publicly posts its privacy policies and practices concerning processing, use and disclosure of the personally identifiable information provided to it by website visitors. Publication of such privacy policies and other statements published that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of actual policies and practices or if actual practices are found to be unfair. Evolving and changing definitions of what constitutes \u201cPersonal Information\u201d and \u201cPersonal Data\u201d within the EU, the United States and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine or device identification numbers, location data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting technology alliance relationships that may involve the sharing of data.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new business initiatives in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our operating results.\nIn the future we may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u25cf develop and enhance our products and services;\n\u25cf continue to expand our network of arenas;\n\u25cf hire, train and retain employees;\n\u25cf respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements; or\n\u25cf pursue acquisition opportunities.\nAlthough we have been able to fund our current working capital requirements through operations, debt and equity financing, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our executive officers, key employees and qualified personnel, and our business operations may be severely disrupted if we lose the services of such personnel.\nOur future success depends substantially on the continued efforts of our executive officers and key employees. If one or more of our executive officers or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue their services with us, we might not be able to replace them easily, in a timely manner, or at all. Since the esports gaming industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain qualified staff or other highly skilled employees. If any of our executive officers or key employees terminate their services with us, our business may be severely disrupted, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we may incur additional expenses to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel.\nWe may experience security breaches and cyber threats.\nWe face cyber risks and threats that could damage, disrupt or allow third parties to gain improper access to our networks and platforms, supporting infrastructure, intellectual property and other assets. In addition, we rely on technological infrastructure, including third party cloud hosting and broadband, provided by third party business partners to support the functionality of our platforms and content distribution. These business partners are also subject to cyber risks and threats. Such cyber risks and threats may be difficult to detect. The techniques that may be used to obtain unauthorized access or disable, degrade, exploit or sabotage these networks and gaming platforms change frequently and often are not detected. Our systems and processes and those of our third-party business partners may not be adequate. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks, or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk, could result in interruptions to our platforms, degrade the gamer/user experiences, cause gamers/users to lose confidence in our platforms and cease utilizing them, as well as significant legal and financial exposure. This could harm our business and reputation, disrupt our relationships with partners and diminish our competitive position.\nGlobal health threats, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 respiratory illness first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. A significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and services.\nThe magnitude and duration of the COVID19-pandemic has had a significant adverse effect on the Company. As a global entertainment company that hosts numerous live events with spectators and participants in destination cities, such outbreak has caused people to avoid traveling to and attending our events. Allied Esports cancelled or postponed live events, and until Allied Esports\u2019 flagship gaming arena located at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada reopened on June 25, 2020, Allied Esports was operating online only. Truck events in Europe have been slow to return but the Luxor arena is currently running at full capacity for daily play and weekly tournaments. and, given the positive effects of vaccines on the US and global populations along with relaxed restrictions on travel and social gatherings, we expect that such impacts will be less significant on our future operations and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Allied Esports\u2019 Intellectual Property\nAllied Esports licensed certain brand names under agreements that have expired and may also be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nAllied Esports\u2019s license with a third party to use the names \u201cEsports Arena Las Vegas\u201d and \u201cEsports Arena Drive\u201d, which are part of the branding for its Las Vegas flagship esports arena location and its US-based mobile arena, respectively, ended in July 2021. Although Allied Esports intends to market and promote its esports arenas using intellectual property it owns and controls, and is discontinuing use of such branding, there are no assurances that those efforts will be fruitful and that it will be able to maintain brand awareness once the license expires.\nFurthermore, third parties may claim that Allied Esports has infringed their intellectual property rights. Although Allied Esports takes steps to avoid violating the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement. Infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be expensive to defend and divert the attention of Allied Esports\u2019 management and employees from business operations. Such claims or litigation could require Allied Esports to pay damages, royalties, legal fees and other costs. Allied Esports also could be required to stop offering, distributing or supporting esports games, its to-be-developed gaming platform or other features or services which incorporate the affected intellectual property rights, redesign products, features or services to avoid infringement, or obtain a license, all of which could be costly and harm its business.\nAllied Esports\u2019 technology, content and brands are subject to the threat of piracy, unauthorized copying and other forms of intellectual property infringement.\nAllied Esports regards its technology, content and brands as proprietary and takes measures to protect it from infringement. Piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying and use of technology, content and brands are persistent, and policing is difficult. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of Allied Esports\u2019 rights may be ineffective in such countries, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAllied Esports may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of its intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nAllied Esports regards its registered trademark and pending trademarks, service marks, pending patents, domain names, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to its success. Allied Esports relies on trademark and patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements with its employees and others to protect its proprietary rights.\nAllied Esports has invested significant resources to develop its own intellectual property and acquire licenses to use and distribute the intellectual property of others. Failure to maintain or protect these rights could harm its business. In addition, any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may adversely affect its current and future revenues.\nAllied Esports may not be able to develop compelling intellectual property content or secure media content distributors to promote, sell, and distribute such content, which could harm its business and competitive position.\nAllied Esports intends to produce licensable content from the various live events, tournaments, and its own initiatives and brands to sell to viewers worldwide. There is no guarantee that it will be able to develop content that is compelling to its targeted customers. Media and gaming company competitors, many of which are better funded, are also creating content from esports events, and it will be difficult to create content that stands out and attracts customers. Furthermore, to carry out Allied Esports\u2019 worldwide distribution plans, film and media distribution partners will be needed and, in the event, Allied Esports is not able to secure content distributors on terms acceptable to Allied Esports, this will have a significant adverse impact on revenue streams from the sale or licensing of intellectual property.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company is a company with cash, investments, and our esports business, which may prove difficult for investors to evaluate our ability to achieve stated business objectives.\nAs a result of our sale of the WPT business in July 2021, we have disposed of substantially all of our operating assets other than cash, investments and our esports business. The Company recently announced that its Board of Directors has decided to explore strategic options for the esports business in order to maximize its value to stockholders, including a possible sale, and the Company has engaged a financial advisor to assist with the process. If the Company pursues and ultimately completes a sale of the esports business, we would then become a development stage company with no historic operating results. In that situation we would expect to proceed (likely under a new name) as a publicly traded holding company focused on using our cash resources to explore opportunities in online entertainment, including but not limited to, real money gaming and other gaming sectors; however, we do not plan to limit ourselves to any particular industry or geographic location in its efforts to identify prospective target businesses. Currently, however, we have no specific merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or other business combination under consideration or contemplation. We may be unsuccessful in pursuing acquisition targets, or acquisition targets, if acquired, may not prove to have successful operations.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock; as a result, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock with the proceeds of the WPT sale transaction. Any future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, if any, to stockholders, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in or individual scandals, and, in response, the market price of shares of our common stock could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your shares of common stock at or above a price you feel is appropriate.\nIn the past few years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf our operating and financial performance in any given period does not meet the guidance that we provide to the public, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe may, but are not obligated to, provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Any such guidance will be comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in our public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed any guidance we have provided, especially in times of economic uncertainty. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline as well. Even if we do issue public guidance, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future.\nWe incur increased costs and are subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of being a public company, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that are not incurred by private companies, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related rules implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market. The expenses generally incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations also may make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, on our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock on the Nasdaq market, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nThrough its wholly-owned subsidiary Primo Vital Limited, Ourgame International Holdings Limited (\u201cOurgame\u201d) owns a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock, enabling it to exert significant influence over our operations and activities, which may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAccording to its SEC filings, Ourgame, through Primo Vital Limited, beneficially owns and controls approximately 35.8% of our outstanding common stock. Primo Vital Limited is entitled to full voting rights with respect to the shares of common stock that it owns. This concentrated ownership enables Ourgame to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder votes, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation or our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution. The interests of Ourgame may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders, and Ourgame\u2019s influence may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by us or our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of the Company. Also, Ourgame may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investments in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our shares could decline. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our shares because prospective investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company such as our company with such a significant stockholder.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced public company reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and plan to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to: being permitted to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related selected financial data and management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure; an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, registration statements and proxy statements; and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We intend to take advantage of the exemptions discussed above. As a result, the information we provide will be different than the information that is available with respect to other public companies. In our SEC filings, we do not include all of the executive compensation-related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of our 2022 fiscal year, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (iii) the date on which we have, during the immediately preceding three-year period, issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nOur failure to achieve and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our financial position and lower our stock price.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Nevertheless, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nManagement identified the following material weaknesses in internal controls as of December 31, 2020, which persist as of December 31, 2021:\n\u25cf inadequate internal controls, including inadequate segregation of duties, over the preparation and review of the consolidated financial statements and untimely annual closings of the books;\n\u25cf inadequate information technology general controls as it relates to user access and change management.\nAs a company with limited accounting resources, a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention has been and will be diverted from our business to work toward compliance with these regulatory requirements. This diversion of management\u2019s time and attention may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese material weaknesses and any significant deficiencies could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and any annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we may be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our common stock listing on Nasdaq.\nIncreases in interest rates may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWhile interest rates have in recent years been at record low levels, the likely return to increases in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments. Any such increase in interest rates or reduction in demand for our common stock resulting from other relatively more attractive investment opportunities may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one of more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume of our common stock to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or if our reporting results do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nYou will be diluted by the future issuance of common stock, preferred stock, or securities convertible into common or preferred stock, in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, capital raises or otherwise.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise.\nIn the future, we expect to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our capital stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Issuing additional shares of our capital stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.\nAdditionally, we have reserved an aggregate of 3,763,305 shares of common stock for issuance under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the \u201c2019 Plan\u201d). Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2019 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by our common stockholders. We have filed an effective registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our 2019 Plan. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market upon issuance.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders, which could limit the Company\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers or employees.\nThe Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the Company\u2019s Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court located within the State of Delaware, or if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision and asserts claims under the Securities Act, inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rule and regulations thereunder. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nIf a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to the Company\u2019s management.\nOur Board of Directors\u2019 ability to issue undesignated preferred stock and the existence of anti-takeover provisions may depress the value of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s authorized capital includes 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock. Our Board has the power to issue any or all of the shares of preferred stock, including the authority to establish one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences, rights and limitations of such class or series, without seeking stockholder approval, subject to certain limitations on this power under Nasdaq listing requirements. Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding \u201cbusiness combinations.\u201d We may, in the future, consider adopting additional anti-takeover measures. The authority of our Board to issue undesignated stock and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, as well as any future anti-takeover measures adopted by us, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of our company that are not approved by our Board. As a result, our stockholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at favorable prices generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal and the market price, voting and other rights of the holders of common stock may also be affected.", "PERMNO": 16975, "SIC": 7900, "TIC": "AESE"}
