{"cik": "106532", "company": "WEYCO GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nThere are various factors that affect or might affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The following is a description of some of the material factors that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk factors related to our operations\nThe Company relies on independent foreign sources of production and the availability of leather, rubber and other raw materials; a deterioration in the Company\u2019s relationship with, or other issues affecting, such manufacturers and/or issues with the availability of raw materials could have unfavorable effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company purchases all of its products from independent foreign manufacturers, primarily in China and India. Although the Company believes that it has good working relationships with its manufacturers, the Company does not have long-term contracts with them. Thus, the Company could experience increases in manufacturing costs, disruptions in the timely supply of products or unanticipated reductions in manufacturing capacity, any of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has the ability to move production to different suppliers; however, the transition may not occur smoothly or quickly, which could result in the Company missing customer delivery date requirements and, consequently, the Company could lose future orders and its reputation may be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s use of foreign sources of production results in relatively long production and delivery lead times. Therefore, the Company typically forecasts demand at least five months in advance. If the Company\u2019s forecasts are wrong or there are significant changes in demand, it would result in a loss of sales if the Company does not have enough product on hand or in reduced margins if the Company has excess inventory that needs to be sold at discounted prices.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by disruptions at U.S. or foreign ports or other transportation facilities, such as those due to labor disputes and work stoppages, political unrest, trade protection measures or trade wars, severe weather (climate change may increase the frequency and severity of severe weather conditions or events), outbreaks of infectious diseases, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to its customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transportation costs, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s overall profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s products depend on the availability of raw materials, especially leather and rubber. Any significant shortages of quantities or increases in the cost of leather or rubber would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, unless the Company was able to pass such costs along to its customers.\nAdditional risks associated with foreign sourcing that could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business include adverse changes in foreign economic conditions, import regulations, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties, tariffs, quotas and political or labor interruptions, foreign currency fluctuations, expropriation and nationalization. For example, beginning in 2019, an additional tariff was imposed on leather footwear imported from China, where the Company sources a significant portion of its products. Although this tariff did not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations due to various mitigation efforts, the imposition of additional tariffs on the Company\u2019s products could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future results of operations. It is difficult to predict the effects of current or future tariffs and other trade barriers and disputes, and the Company's efforts to reduce the effects of tariffs through pricing and other measures may not be effective.\nA disruption in the Company's supply chain could adversely affect its profitability.\nMost of the Company's products for North American distribution are shipped to the Company via ocean freight carriers to ports primarily on the west coast of North America. The Company\u2019s reliance on ocean freight transportation for the delivery of its inventory exposes it\nto various inherent risks, including port congestion, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, and terrorism, any of which could result in delivery delays and inefficiencies, increased costs and disruption of business. In 2021, the Company's supply chain was disrupted by congestion throughout the supply chain, domestic port and warehousing delays, and container shortages, resulting in the Company incurring premium freight charges on a portion of its imports. In addition to these factors, global inflation has also contributed to already higher incremental freight costs. Severe disruptions of the supply chain may force the Company to use more expensive methods to ship its products, and it may not be able to meet its customers delivery requirements which may result in loss of sales.\nAny severe and prolonged disruption to ocean freight transportation could force the Company to rely on alternate and more expensive transportation systems. Efficient and timely inventory deliveries and proper inventory management are important factors in the Company's operations. Extended delays and disruptions in shipments could result in negative impacts to the pricing of the Company's products due to changes in the availability of inventory, increased shipping costs, or missed sales that may materially adversely impact its business and results of operations.\nLoss of the services of the Company\u2019s top executives and an inability to effectively manage leadership transitions, could adversely affect the business.\nThomas W. Florsheim, Jr., the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John W. Florsheim, the Company\u2019s President, Chief Operating Officer and Assistant Secretary, each have a strong heritage within the Company and the footwear industry. They possess knowledge, relationships and reputations based on their lifetime exposure to and experience in the Company and the industry. The unexpected loss of either one or both of the Company\u2019s top executives could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s performance. A loss of the skills, industry knowledge, contacts and expertise of any of the Company's senior executives could cause a setback to its operating plan and strategy. In addition, transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals include the possibility of disruptions, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully integrate new brands and businesses.\nThe Company continues to look for acquisition opportunities. Those search efforts could be unsuccessful and costs could be incurred in any failed efforts. Further, if and when an acquisition occurs, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to successfully integrate the brand into its current operations, or that any acquired brand would achieve results in line with the Company\u2019s historical performance or its specific expectations for the brand.\nRisk factors related to our business and industry\nDecreases in disposable income and general market volatility in the U.S. and global economy may adversely affect the Company.\nSpending patterns in the footwear market, particularly those in the moderate-priced market in which a majority of the Company\u2019s products compete, have historically been correlated with consumers\u2019 disposable income. As a result, the success of the Company is affected by changes in general economic conditions, especially in the United States. Factors affecting discretionary income for the moderate consumer include, among others, general business conditions, gas and energy costs, inflation rates, employment rates, consumer confidence, interest rates and taxation. Additionally, the economy and consumer behavior generally impact the financial strength and buying patterns of retailers, which can also affect the Company\u2019s results. Volatile, unstable or weak economic conditions, or a worsening of conditions, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales volume and overall performance.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to operating in the retail environment that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with doing business in the retail environment, primarily in the United States. The U.S. retail industry has experienced a growing trend toward consolidation of large retailers. The merger of additional major retailers could result in the Company losing sales volume or increasing its concentration of business with a few large accounts, resulting in reduced bargaining power, which could increase pricing pressures and lower the Company\u2019s margins.\nThe Company regularly assesses its retail locations in the U.S. and overseas and, at times, including during fiscal 2021, has closed unprofitable retail locations and incurred costs related to such closures. Future closures could have a material adverse effect on results.\nAs the popularity of online shopping for consumer goods continues to increase, the Company\u2019s retail partners in the U.S. and abroad may experience decreased foot traffic, which could negatively impact their businesses. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a decrease in foot traffic; other significant health pandemic or outbreaks of infectious diseases could also lead to a similar decrease in foot traffic. Decreases in foot traffic have, and in the future may, in turn, negatively impact the Company\u2019s sales to those customers, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment, which may result in lower prices and reduced profits.\nThe footwear market is extremely competitive. The Company competes with numerous manufacturers, distributors and retailers of men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. The\nCompany competes with these companies primarily on the basis of price, quality, service and brand recognition, all of which are important competitive factors in the shoe industry. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain its competitive edge depends upon these factors, as well as its ability to deliver new products at the best value for the consumer, maintain positive brand recognition, and obtain sufficient retail floor space and effective product presentation at retail. If the Company does not remain competitive, future prospects, results of operations and financial condition could decline.\nChanges in fashion trends and consumer preferences could negatively impact the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent upon its ability to accurately anticipate and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, purchases of dress and other dress-casual footwear were negatively affected in 2020 and early 2021 as many consumers worked from home due to stay-at-home orders or otherwise, and social as well as other occasion-related events were cancelled. Failure to predict or effectively respond to trends or preferences could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s sales volume and overall performance, as well as have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company conducts business globally, which exposes it to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as political, economic and social risks.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with its primary exposures being to the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. The Company is therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is exposed to other risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including political, economic or social instability, armed conflicts, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, changes in government policies and regulations, outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), severe weather events, natural disasters, and exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). The Company is also exposed to risks relating to U.S. policy with respect to companies doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Additional legislation or other changes in the U.S. tax laws or interpretations could increase the Company\u2019s U.S. income tax liability and adversely affect the Company\u2019s after-tax profitability. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nIn connection with increasing tensions related to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, governments in the U.S., U.K. and the EU have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where the Company does business, which could adversely affect its business and/or supply chain, international subsidiaries, business partners or customers in the broader region. The Company\u2019s business may be impacted as a result of various factors, including inflation, increased energy prices, a slowing U.S. economy, more ocean freight disruptions, increased cyber-attacks, and reduced consumer confidence.\nRisk factors related to cybersecurity\nThe Company is dependent on information and communication systems to support its business and e-commerce sales. Significant interruptions could disrupt its business and damage its reputation.\nThe Company accepts and fills the majority of its larger customers\u2019 orders through the use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and it relies on its warehouse management system to efficiently process orders. The Company\u2019s corporate office relies on computer systems to efficiently process and record transactions. Significant interruptions in the Company\u2019s EDI, information and communication systems from power loss, telecommunications failure, malicious attacks, or computer system failure could significantly disrupt the Company\u2019s business and operations, as well as damage its reputation. In addition, the Company sells footwear on its websites, and failures of the Company\u2019s or other retailers\u2019 websites could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales, results, and reputation.\nThe Company, particularly its retail segment and its e-commerce businesses, is subject to the risk of data loss and security breaches.\nThe Company sells footwear in its retail stores and on its websites, and therefore the Company and/or its third-party credit card processors must process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information of its customers. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of Company technology and systems, could expose the Company or its customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for the Company, and otherwise harm the Company\u2019s business and/or reputation. The Company\u2019s technology and systems, as well as those of its partners have, and in the future may, become the target of cyberattacks. To this point, the Company has not experienced a material breach; however, in order to address these risks, the Company has secured cyber insurance and it uses third party technology and systems to aid in safeguarding the Company\u2019s data and systems, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Although the Company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches,\nincluding systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nRisk factors related to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases\nThe duration and scope of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and may continue to adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain, distribution, and demand for its products.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 and related variants has created significant uncertainty within the global markets that the Company serves. The Company has operations, customers and suppliers in countries significantly impacted by COVID-19. Governmental authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, increased border controls and closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns, and such authorities may impose additional restrictions in the future. The Company has also taken actions to protect its employees and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within its business. There can be no assurance that the measures implemented by governmental authorities or the Company\u2019s actions will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion.\nThe impact of COVID-19 has resulted in disruptions to the Company\u2019s supply chain, and may continue to do so, which could negatively impact its ability to meet customer demand. In particular, the Company\u2019s suppliers located in China are subject to a heightened risk of temporary or permanent shutdowns due to China\u2019s zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy. The duration of the disruption to the Company\u2019s supply chain, and the related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time, although the Company expects these challenges to continue to impact it at least through the first part of 2022. Should such disruption continue for an extended period of time, or if the Company encounters significant work stoppages or outbreaks due to COVID-19 at one or more of its locations or suppliers in the future, the Company may not be able to satisfy customer demand for a period of time.\nFurthermore, the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, demand for the Company\u2019s products and impacts to its operations, including the measures taken by governmental authorities to address it, may precipitate or exacerbate other risks and/or uncertainties, including specifically many of the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report, including inflationary costs, disruptions due to labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions, which may have a significant impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition, although it is unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nRisks related to financing, investment and pension matters\nVolatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and global credit markets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nU.S. and global financial markets have at times been unstable and unpredictable, which has generally resulted in tightened credit markets with heightened lending standards and terms. The ultimate impact on the U.S. and global financial markets of the Russian invasion of Ukraine cannot yet be predicted, and will depend on the severity and duration of the conflict and the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries. Volatility and instability in the credit markets pose various risks to the Company, including, among others, a negative impact on retailer and consumer confidence, limits to the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 access to credit markets and interference with the normal commercial relationships between the Company and its customers. Increased credit risks associated with the financial condition of some customers in the retail industry affects their level of purchases from the Company and the collectability of amounts owed to the Company, and in some cases, causes the Company to reduce or cease shipments to certain customers who no longer meet the Company\u2019s credit requirements.\nIn addition, weak economic conditions and unstable and volatile financial markets could lead to certain of the Company\u2019s customers experiencing cash flow problems, which may force them into higher default rates or to file for bankruptcy protection which may increase the Company\u2019s bad debt expense or further negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nInterest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing. The Company\u2019s U.S. dollar variable rate debt currently uses London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for determining interest rates. In connection with the Company\u2019s line of credit amendment in November 2021, language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate, selected by the bank and the Company, as a replacement to LIBOR that would take affect at the time LIBOR ceases.\nDeterioration of the municipal bond market in general or of specific municipal bonds held by the Company or its pension plan may result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nThe Company maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of investment-grade municipal bond investments. The Company\u2019s investment policy only permits the purchase of investment-grade securities. The Company\u2019s investment portfolio totaled $10.2 million as of December 31, 2021, or approximately 4% of total assets. If the value of municipal bonds in general or any of the Company\u2019s municipal bond holdings deteriorate, the performance of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk factors related to our capital structure\nThe limited public float and trading volume for the Company\u2019s stock may have an adverse impact on the stock price or make it difficult to liquidate.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is held by a relatively small number of shareholders. The Florsheim family owns approximately 50% of the stock and one institutional shareholder holds a significant block. Other officers, directors, and members of management own stock or have the potential to own stock through previously granted stock options and restricted stock. Consequently, the Company has a relatively small public float and low average daily trading volume, which could affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell stock or the price at which it can be sold. In addition, future sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market by large shareholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely impact the market price of the stock and the stock could be difficult for the shareholder to liquidate.", "PERMNO": 38033, "SIC": 5130, "TIC": "WEYS"}
