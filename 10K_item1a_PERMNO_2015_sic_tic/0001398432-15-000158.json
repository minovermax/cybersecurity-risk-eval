Risk Factors\nOwnership of our securities involves a high degree of risk. Holders of our securities should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our historical financial statements and related notes included herein. The following discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or businesses in general, may also impair our businesses operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in a material way. This could cause the trading prices of our securities to decline, perhaps significantly, and you may lose part or all of your investment. Please see \u201cCautionary Notes Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of incurring significant net losses, and our future profitability is not assured.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014 and the period from April 20, 2013 (the date we consummated our acquisition of Symon) through December 31, 2013, we incurred net losses of approximately $72.5 million and $13.0 million, respectively. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and there can be no assurances that we will be profitable in the foreseeable future, if at all. If our revenues decrease in a given period, we may be unable to reduce cost of revenues as a significant part of our cost of revenues are fixed, which could materially and adversely affect our business and, therefore, our results of operations and lead to a net loss (or a larger net loss) for that period and subsequent periods.\nWe may require significant amounts of additional financing to execute our business plan and fund our other liquidity needs. If we do not raise sufficient funds, and/or if our future operating results do not meet or exceed our projections, we may be unable to continue operations and could be forced to substantially curtail operations or cease operations all together.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $14.0 million in outstanding indebtedness pursuant to a term loan under a senior credit facility. As of March 26, 2015, all outstanding indebtedness under this loan was converted into Series A Preferred Stock. We currently have no revolving credit facility or other committed source of recurring capital. Unless we are able to increase our revenues or decrease our operating expenses from recent historical run-rate levels, we expect that we will need to obtain additional capital during 2015 to fund our planned operations. If our cash flows from operations do not meet or exceed our projections, we may need to pursue one or more alternatives, such as to:\n\u00b7\nreduce or delay planned capital expenditures or investments in our business;\n\u00b7\nseek additional financing or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity;\n\u00b7\nsell assets or businesses;\n\u00b7\nsell additional equity; or\n\u00b7\ncurtail our operations.\nAny such actions may materially and adversely affect our future prospects. In addition, we cannot ensure that we will be able to raise additional equity capital, restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe markets for digital signage and advertising are competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully.\nThe markets for digital signage and advertising are very competitive and we must compete with other established providers. We compete with larger companies in many of the markets we serve. We compete for advertising sales directly with all media platforms, including radio and television broadcasting, cable and satellite television services, various local print media, billboards and Internet portals and search engines and digital out-of-home advertising represents a small portion of this market.\nWe expect existing competitors and new entrants into the markets where we do business to constantly revise and improve their business models in light of challenges from us or other companies in the industry. If we cannot respond effectively to advances by our competitors, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIncreased competition may result in new products and services that fundamentally change our markets, reduce prices, reduce margins or decrease our market share. We may be unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors, some of whom may have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than we do.\nOur operations are subject to the strength or weakness of our customers\u2019 businesses, and we may not be able to mitigate that risk.\nA large percentage of our business is attributable to customers in industries which are sensitive to general economic conditions. During periods of economic slowdown or during periods of weak business results, our customers often reduce their capital and advertising expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects, facilities upgrades or promotional activities. Such developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties.\nFor example, in 2008, a very large U.S.- based mortgage company, which was at the time one of our largest Enterprise Solutions customers, did not buy any of our products as a result of the economic downturn. Similar slowdowns could affect our customers in the hospitality industry in the wake of terrorist attacks, economic downturns or material changes in corporate travel habits. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting economic conditions, budgeting and buying patterns. Periods of a slowing economy or recession, or periods of economic uncertainty, may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising spending.\nContinued weakness in the industries we serve has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on sales of our products and our results of operations. A long term continued or heightened economic downturn in one or more of the key industries that we serve, or in the worldwide economy, could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from historical and expected results.\nFurthermore, even in the absence of a downturn in general economic conditions, our customers may reduce the money they spend on our products and services for a number of other reasons, including:\n\u00b7\na decline in economic conditions in an industry we serve;\n\u00b7\na decline in advertising or capital spending in general;\n\u00b7\na decision to shift expenditures to competing products;\n\u00b7\nunfavorable local or regional economic conditions; or\n\u00b7\na downturn in an individual business sector or market.\nSuch conditions could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from our products and services, with a corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe recent and ongoing global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAs widely reported, financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have experienced extreme disruption since late 2008, and while there has been improvement in recent years, the worldwide economy remains fragile as uncertainty remains regarding when the economy will improve to historical growth levels. Any return to the conditions that existed during the recent recession or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, concerns about inflation or deflation, the threat of another recession, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and extreme volatility in the credit and equity markets, may lead to decreased demand or delay in payments by our customers or to slowing of their payments to us, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by these actions. These challenging economic conditions also may result in:\n\u00b7\nincreased competition for fewer industry dollars;\n\u00b7\npricing pressure that may adversely affect revenue and gross margin;\n\u00b7\nreduced credit availability and/or access to capital markets;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty forecasting, budgeting and planning due to limited visibility into the spending plans of current or prospective customers; or\n\u00b7\ncustomer financial difficulty and increased risk of doubtful accounts receivable.\nCurrency fluctuations may adversely affect our business.\nIn 2014, approximately 25% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States. Accordingly, we receive a significant portion of our revenues in euros and other foreign currencies. However, for financial reporting purposes, we use the U.S. dollar. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against the euro and other foreign currencies, the translation of foreign currency denominated transactions will result in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for us. We have not entered into agreements or purchased instruments to hedge our exchange rate risks, although we may do so in the future. The availability and effectiveness of any hedging transaction may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exchange rate risks.\nA higher percentage of our sales and profitability occur in the third and fourth quarters.\nWe sell more of our products in the third and fourth quarters because of traditional technology and advertising buying patterns of our customers. Advertising cycles, corporate year end budgets, government buying and regional economics will affect the amount of our products and services that will fit into customers\u2019 budgets late in the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during the third and fourth quarters could have an adverse effect on our annual sales and profitability. In addition, slower selling cycles during the first and second quarters may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly in the future.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. These fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We base our planned operating expenses in part on expectations of future revenues, and our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. If revenues for a particular quarter are lower than we expect, we may be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter, which would harm our operating results for that quarter. In future periods, our revenue and operating results may be below the expectation of analysts and investors, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Factors that are likely to cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate include those discussed elsewhere in this section.\nThe nature of advertising sales cycles and shifting needs of advertisers makes it difficult for us to forecast revenues and increases the variability of quarterly fluctuations, which could cause us to improperly plan for our operations.\nA substantial amount of our advertising commitments are made months in advance of when the advertising airs on our media networks. Between the time at which advertising commitments are made and the advertising is aired, the needs of our advertisers can change. Advertisers may desire to change the timing, level of commitment and other aspects of their advertising placements. As a result, our future advertising commitment at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for any succeeding period, making it more difficult to predict our financial performance. These changes could also negatively impact our financial performance, including quarterly fluctuations.\nImplementation and integration of new products, such as expanding our advertising assets, software, media player and services product portfolios, could harm our results of operations.\nA key component of our growth strategy is to develop and market new products. We may be unable to produce new products and services that meet customers\u2019 needs or specifications. If we fail to meet specific product specifications requested by a customer, the customer may have the right to seek an alternate source for a product or service or to terminate an underlying agreement. A failure to successfully meet the specifications of our potential customers could decrease demand or otherwise significantly hinder market adoption of our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe process of introducing a new product to the market is extremely complex, time consuming and expensive, and will become more complex as new platforms and technologies emerge. In the event we are not successful in developing a wide range of offerings or do not gain wide acceptance in the marketplace, we may not recoup our investment costs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nShortages of components or a loss of, or problems with, a supplier could result in a disruption in the installation or operation of our products or services.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced delays in manufacturing our products for several reasons, including component delivery delays, component shortages and component quality deficiencies. Component shortages, delays in the delivery of components and supplier product quality deficiencies may occur in the future. These delays or problems have in the past and could in the future result in delivery delays, reduced revenues, strained relations with customers and loss of business. Also, in an effort to\navoid actual or perceived component shortages, we may purchase more components than we may otherwise require. Excess component inventory resulting from over-purchases, obsolescence, installation cancellations or a decline in the demand for our products could result in equipment impairment, which in the past has had and in the future would have a negative effect on our financial results.\nWe obtain several of the components used in our products from limited sources. We rarely have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers, and cannot be sure that suppliers will be able to meet our current or future component requirements. If component manufacturers do not allocate a sufficient supply of components to meet our needs or if current suppliers do not provide components of adequate quality or compatibility, we may have to obtain these components at a higher cost from distributors or on the spot market. If we are forced to use alternative suppliers of components, we may have to alter our manufacturing processes or solutions offerings to accommodate these components. Modification of our manufacturing processes or our solutions offerings to use alternative components could cause significant delays and reduce our ability to generate revenues.\nThe failure of our service providers to provide, install and maintain our equipment could result in service interruptions and damage to our business.\nWe are and will continue to be significantly dependent upon third-party service providers to provide, install and maintain relevant video display and media player equipment at our installations. The failure of any third-party provider to continue to perform these services adequately and timely could interrupt our business and damage our relationship with our partners and their relationship with consumers. Any outage would also impact our ability to deliver on the contracted service levels, which would prevent us from recognizing revenues.\nWe rely on third parties for data transmission, and the interruption or unavailability of adequate bandwidth for transmission could prevent us from distributing our programming as planned.\nWe transmit the majority of the content that we provide to our partners and customers using Internet connectivity supplied by a variety of third-party network providers. We also rely on the networks of some of our partners to transmit content to individual screens. If we or our partners experience failures or limited network capacity, we may be unable to maintain programming and meet our advertising commitments. Problems with data transmission may be due to hardware failures, operating system failures or other causes beyond our control. In addition, there are a limited number of Internet providers with whom we could contract, and we may be unable to replace our current providers on favorable terms, if at all. If the transmission of data to our partners or customers becomes unavailable, limited due to bandwidth constraints or is interrupted or delayed because of necessary equipment changes, our partner and customer relationships and our ability to obtain revenues from current and new partners and customers could suffer.\nComputer viruses or hacks could cause significant downtime for our media network, decreasing our revenues and damaging our relationships with partners and customers.\nWe generate revenues from the sales of advertising and content that is aired in our partners\u2019 and customers\u2019 installations. Computer hackers infecting our network, or the networks of our partners or customers in which our network is integrated, with viruses could cause our network to be unavailable. Significant downtime could decrease our revenues and harm our relationships and reputation with partners, customers and consumers.\nOur products often operate on the same network used by our customers for other aspects of their businesses, and we may be held responsible for defects or breakdowns in these networks if it is believed that such defects or breakdowns were caused by our products.\nOur products are operated across our customers\u2019 proprietary networks, which are used to operate other aspects of these customers\u2019 businesses. In these circumstances, any defect or virus that occurs on our products may enter a customer\u2019s network, which could impact other aspects of the customer\u2019s business. The impact on a customer\u2019s business could be severe, and if we were held responsible, it could have an adverse effect on our customer relationships and on our operating results.\nThe content we distribute to partners and customers may expose us to liability.\nWe provide or facilitate the distribution of content for our partners and customers. This content includes advertising-related content, as well as movie and television content and other media, much of which is obtained from third parties. As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, or other claims based on the content that we distribute. We or entities that we license content from may not be adequately insured or indemnified to cover claims of these types or liability that may be imposed on us.\nThe growth of our business is dependent in part on successfully implementing our international expansion strategy.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding our geographic coverage in or into the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. In many cases, we have limited experience in these regions, and may encounter difficulties due to different technology standards, legal considerations, language barriers, distance and cultural differences. We may not be able to manage operations in these regions effectively and efficiently or compete effectively in these new markets. If we do not generate sufficient revenues from these regions to offset the expense of expansion into these regions, or if we do not effectively manage accounts receivable, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and taxes, our business and our ability to increase revenues and enhance our operating results could suffer.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or execute on expansion strategies.\nWe have expanded, and continue to expand, our operations into new markets. The growth in our business and operations has required, and will continue to require, significant attention from management and place a strain on operational systems and resources. To accommodate this growth, we will need to upgrade, improve or implement a variety of operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, including the improvement of accounting and other internal management systems, all of which require substantial management efforts.\nWe will also need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce, manage our relationships with our customers, and add sales and marketing offices and personnel to service these relationships. All of these endeavors will require substantial managerial efforts and skill, and incur additional expenditures. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively and, as a result, may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute on expansion strategies or meet the demands of our customers.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or investments.\nWe acquired our operating subsidiaries in two separate business combinations in April 2013, and our operating subsidiaries, in turn, have grown their businesses in part through acquisitions. For example, AFS Message-Link and Dacon, Ltd. are companies that Symon purchased in 2006 and 2008, respectively. AFS Message-Link allowed Symon to enter the hospitality digital markets as a key industry participant, and Symon\u2019s acquisition of Dacon, a company based in the United Kingdom, expanded Symon\u2019s contact center market presence and its base of large resellers. Likewise, RMG established its executive airline club business through the acquisition of the Executive Media Network and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in April 2011. As part of our business strategy, we intend to make future acquisitions of, or investments in, technologies, products and businesses that we believe could complement or expand our business, enhance our technical capabilities or offer growth opportunities. However, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future or make these acquisitions on a commercially reasonable basis, or at all. In addition, we may spend significant management time and resources in analyzing and negotiating acquisitions or investments that do not come to fruition. These resources could otherwise be spent on our own customer development, marketing and customer sales efforts and research and development.\nAny future acquisitions and investments we may undertake, subject us to various risks, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure to transition key customer relationships and sustain or grow sales levels, particularly in the short-term;\n\u00b7\nloss of key employees related to acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ninability to successfully integrate acquired technologies or operations;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize anticipated synergies in sales, marketing and distribution;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects on our existing business relationships;\n\u00b7\npotentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities;\n\u00b7\nexpenses related to amortization of intangible assets and potential write-offs of acquired assets; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to recover the costs of acquisitions.\nIf our acquisition strategy is not effective, we may not be able to expand our business as expected. In addition, our operating expenses may increase more than our revenues as a result of such expansion efforts, which could materially impact our operating results and our stock price.\nOur strategy to expand our sales and marketing operations and activities may not generate the revenue increases anticipated or such revenue increases may only be realized over a longer period than currently expected.\nBuilding a digital signage solutions customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our digital signage solutions will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing operations and activities. We plan to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally; however, there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel. Our business could be harmed if our sales and marketing expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue.\nWe have a minimum payment commitment to an advertising partner that if we cannot service could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe have a minimum payment commitment to one of our advertising partners. This commitment constitutes a significant part of our cost of revenues. If our revenues decrease in a given period, we may be unable to reduce cost of revenues as a significant part of our cost of revenues is fixed, which could materially and adversely affect our business and, therefore, our results of operations and lead to a net loss for that period and subsequent periods.\nThere is no assurance that the proposed sale of our Airline Media Network business will be completed, and our inability to consummate the proposed sale could harm the market price of our common stock and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is no assurance the proposed sale of our Airline Media Network business will occur when and as we expect, or at all. Currently, we are party only to a non-binding letter of intent with respect to the proposed sale, and we may not be able to reach agreement with the prospective purchaser as to the terms of a definitive agreement. In addition, even if we do enter into a definitive agreement, the proposed sale may not be completed, due to a failure to satisfy required closing conditions or otherwise. If the proposed sale is not completed for any reason, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, failure to complete the proposed sale will result in a reduction in the amount of cash otherwise available to us and may limit our ability to implement our business strategy. The failure of the sale to occur may also result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us among other potential buyers of our Airline Media Network business, as well as in the investment community generally. We may be unable to locate a buyer willing to purchase the Airline Media Network business on terms equivalent to or more attractive than those contemplated by the existing letter of intent. Finally, we are incurring expenses pursuing the sale of our Airline Media Network business, and these expenses will reduce our earnings and cash flows, whether or not the sale is completed.\nWhile the proposed sale of our Airline Media Network business is pending, it creates uncertainty about our future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile the proposed sale of our Airline Media Network business is pending, it creates uncertainty about our future. As a result of this uncertainty, our current or potential business partners may decide to delay, defer or cancel entering into new business arrangements with us pending completion or termination of the proposed sale. In addition, while the proposed sale is pending, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management and employee attention from our day-to-day business;\n\u00b7\nthe potential disruption to business partners and other service providers; and\n\u00b7\nthe possible inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur RMG Media Networks business unit has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate its business and prospects.\nRMG began business operations in September 2005 as Danouv Inc., developing a digital signage technology platform for ad serving and content distribution. RMG launched an initial media network with 650 screens in coffee shops and eateries in August 2006. In September 2006, Danouv Inc. changed its name to Danoo Inc. In July 2009, Danoo purchased certain assets of IdeaCast Inc., which operated a digital signage network in gyms and fitness centers and in the airline in-flight entertainment space. In August 2009, Danoo was renamed RMG Networks, Inc.\nRMG acquired certain assets and cash from Pharmacy TV Network, LLC in March 2010 in an all-stock transaction. Pharmacy TV was a retail point of sale network in pharmacies across the United States. RMG subsequently shut this network down during the fourth quarter of 2011 due to lack of scale and advertiser demand. RMG acquired Executive Media Network Worldwide and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Corporate Image Media, Inc. and Prophet Media, LLC (collectively the Executive Media Network) in April 2011 to extend its airline media offering from airport business lounges to in-flight media. The Executive Media Network acquisition introduced a proprietary booking, tracking and inventory system called Charlie into the RMG technology portfolio. The Executive Media Network was subsequently transitioned to the RMG technology platform for content delivery and network management. This acquisition also consolidated the number of companies in the United States working with airlines to sell media. During the first quarter of 2012, RMG divested the NYTimes.com Today network, and in July 2012 RMG sold the Fitness Network.\nRMG took steps to align resources behind the airline media properties because RMG was a category leader in that space in 2012. Accordingly, it has a limited operating history for operations upon which you can evaluate the viability and sustainability of its business and its acceptance by advertisers and consumers. It is also difficult to evaluate the viability of RMG\u2019s use of audiovisual advertising displays in airline executive clubs, IFE displays, Wi-Fi advertising and other digital out-of-home commercial locations as a business model because it does not have sufficient experience to address the risks frequently encountered by early stage companies using new forms of advertising media and entering new and rapidly evolving markets. These circumstances may make it difficult to evaluate RMG\u2019s business and prospects.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive, and a substantial weakening of, or business failure by, any of our partner airlines could negatively affect our revenues and jeopardize any investment we make in deploying the RMG Airline Network in airline executive clubs.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and has experienced substantial consolidation. Because our ability to generate revenues from advertising sales and services depends upon our ongoing relationships with a limited number of airlines, any substantial weakening or failure of the business of one or more of our existing airlines, or the consolidation of one or more of our airlines with a third party, could cause our revenues to decline, adversely affecting our business and prospects.\nWe have in the past made, and plan in the future to make, significant investments in the equipment, installation and support of the RMG Airline Network within airline executive clubs. We intend to pursue opportunities where we may invest in new airline relationships and the deployment of new media inventory, and the weakening, failure or acquisition of any of our airline partners in the future could result in our loss of our investment and/or a negative return on our investment. In addition, we may incur additional expense recovering our equipment from airline executive clubs in the event any such clubs cease to operate or close for any reason.\nIf we are unable to retain or renew existing partnerships on commercially advantageous terms, we may be unable to maintain or expand advertising network coverage and our costs may increase significantly in the future.\nOur ability to generate revenues from advertising sales depends largely upon our ability to provide a large air travel and office advertising network for the display of advertisements. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able retain or renew our existing partnerships with inventory partners and any failure to maintain our network could damage our relationships with advertisers and materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had partner relationships providing access to sell media inventory across 13 unique airline partners. Our airline partner contracts have terms ranging from one to five years. In addition, we have a minimum payment commitment to one of our partners, which comprises a significant portion of our total cost of revenues. This commitment may increase over time and as partnership contracts terminate, we may experience a significant increase in our costs of revenues when we have to renew these contracts. If we cannot pass increased costs onto advertisers through rate increases, our earnings and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our partnership contracts contain provisions granting us certain exclusive advertising rights. We may not be able to retain these exclusivity provisions when we renew these contracts. If we were to lose exclusivity, our advertisers may decide to advertise with our competitors or otherwise reduce their spending on our network and we may lose market share.\nOur partners may terminate their contracts with us, may perform the services we provide them on their own or otherwise may not enter into new contracts with us on terms that are commercially advantageous to us. If our partners seek to negotiate terms that are less favorable to us and we accept such terms, or if we seek to negotiate better terms, but are unable to do so, then our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have relied, and may continue to rely, on a limited number of advertisers for a significant portion of our advertising-related revenues, and such revenues could decline due to the delay of orders from, or the loss of, one or more significant advertisers.\nA small number of advertisers may constitute a significant portion of our advertising-related revenues. Our relationships with these advertisers may not expand or may be disrupted. If a major advertiser purchases less advertising or defers orders in any particular period, or if a relationship with a major advertiser is terminated, our revenues could decline and our operating results may be adversely affected. We are also obligated to provide minimum payments to three partners, which we could have difficulty satisfying if our advertising revenues generated with existing partners significantly decrease for any reason or if we fail to generate advertising revenues with newly obtained partners for any reason. In addition, such new partners may require their own minimum payments.\nIf advertisers or the viewing public do not accept, or lose interest in, our digital out-of-home advertising network, our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may not expand or be successful.\nThe market for digital out-of-home advertising networks worldwide is relatively new and its potential is uncertain. We compete for advertising spending with many forms of more established advertising media. Our success depends on the acceptance of digital out-of-home advertising networks by advertisers and their continuing interest in these media networks as components of their advertising strategies. Our success also depends on the viewing public continuing to be receptive towards its advertising network. Advertisers may elect not to use our services if they believe that consumers are not receptive to our networks or that our networks do not provide sufficient value as effective advertising media. Likewise, if consumers find some element of our networks, such as its in-flight roadblock unit, to be disruptive or intrusive, the airlines may decide not to place our digital displays in their properties or allow us to sell advertising on their IFE systems and advertisers may view our advertising network as a less attractive advertising medium compared to other alternatives. In that event, advertisers may decide to reduce their spending on our networks. If a substantial number of advertisers lose interest in advertising on our networks for these or other reasons, we will be unable to generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to operate our business, and our advertising service revenue, liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAdvertisers may not accept our measurements of our networks audiences or the methodologies may change, which could negatively impact our ability to market and sell our advertising packages.\nWe engage third-party research firms to study the number of people viewing our networks, consumer viewing habits and brand recall. Because our digital out-of-home networks are different from at-home broadcast media, third-party research firms have developed measuring standards and methodologies that differ from those used to measure the amount and characteristics of viewers for other broadcast media. We market and sell advertising packages to advertisers based on these measurements. If third-party research firms were to change the way they measure viewers or their viewing habits, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell advertising. In addition, if advertisers do not accept or challenge the way third parties measure our viewers or their viewing habits, advertisers may be unwilling to purchase advertising at prices acceptable to us, if at all, and our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nIf consumers do not accept our ad-based networks as a part of their out-of-home experience, we may be unable to grow or maintain our Media Networks business.\nThe success of our Media Networks business depends, in part, upon the long-term acceptance of digital media in out-of-home settings by consumers. If consumer viewership of our networks or sentiment towards advertising in general, shifts such that consumers become less receptive, advertisers may reduce their spending and partners may decide not to carry our networks.\nWe must adapt our business model to keep pace with rapid changes in the visual communications market, including rapidly changing technologies and the development of new products and services.\nProviding visual communications solutions is a relatively new and rapidly evolving business, and we will not be successful if our business model does not keep pace with new trends and developments. If we are unable to adapt our business model to keep pace with changes in the industry, or if we are unable to continue to demonstrate the value of our services to our customers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Our success is also dependent on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology and to make investments to develop new products and services. Accordingly, to maintain our competitive position and our revenue base, we must continually modernize and improve the features, reliability and functionality of our products and services. Future technological advances may result in the availability of new service or product offerings or increase in the efficiency of our existing offerings. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, longer relationships with clients, greater brand or name recognition, or significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources than we do. As a result, they may be in a position to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, and to develop and promote their products and\nservices more effectively than we can. We may not be able to adapt to such technological changes or offer new products on a timely or cost effective basis or establish or maintain competitive positions. If we are unable to develop and introduce new products and services, or enhancements to existing products and services, in a timely and successful manner, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf people change the way they travel or reduce the amount that they travel, our revenues may decline and our business may suffer.\nOur success in selling advertising depends, in part, on high traffic airlines and airline executive clubs, which increases the number of potential viewers for the RMG Airline Network. The price at which we sell advertising aired on the RMG Airline Network is a direct result of the number of viewers and the quality of those viewers. If the number of travelers visiting the airline clubs or flying on commercial airplanes decreases, advertisers may decide not to advertise on the RMG Airline Network, may purchase less advertising on the RMG Airline Network or may not be willing to pay for advertising at price points necessary for it to succeed. If alternative methods of communication such as the Internet and other forms of travel increase in popularity, fewer consumers may visit our travel media locations. If consumers change the way they travel, such as increasing travel by car, they may not be receptive to our programming. In either case, our ability to generate revenues from advertisers could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf people change the underlying behaviors that drive viewership of our networks, our revenues may decline and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success in selling advertising depends, in part, on the usage of airlines and airline executive clubs, business offices and shopping malls. Higher usage increases the number of potential viewers for our networks. The price at which we sell advertising is a direct result of the number of viewers and the quality of those viewers of our networks. If the number of travelers visiting the airline clubs, flying on commercial airplanes, using offices or visiting shopping malls decreases, advertisers may decide not to advertise on our networks, may purchase less advertising on our networks or may not be willing to pay for advertising at price points necessary for our networks\u2019 profitable operations. If substitutes for the activities that drive viewership to our networks increase in popularity, fewer consumers may view our networks, our ability to generate revenues from advertisers could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely significantly on information systems and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of those systems could harm our ability to effectively operate our business, harm our net sales, increase our expenses and harm our reputation.\nOur ability to effectively serve our customers on a timely basis depends significantly on our information systems. To manage the growth of our operations, we will need to continue to improve and expand our operational and financial systems, internal controls and business processes; in doing so, we could encounter implementation issues and incur substantial additional expenses. The failure of our information systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact financial accounting and reporting, efficiency of our operations and our ability to properly forecast earnings and cash requirements. We could be required to make significant additional expenditures to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. Such events may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur current or future internet-based operations may be affected by our reliance on third-party hardware and software providers, technology changes, risks related to the failure of computer systems that operate our internet business, telecommunications failures, electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Furthermore, our ability to conduct business on the internet may be affected by liability for online content, patent infringement and state and federal privacy laws.\nIn addition, we may now and in the future implement new systems to increase efficiencies and profitability. To manage growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve and expand our operational and financial systems, internal controls and business processes. When implementing new or changing existing processes, we may encounter transitional issues and incur substantial additional expenses.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers, or even internal users, may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, including our customers, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition, employee error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of any such information could result in a disclosure to third parties outside of our network. As a result, we could incur significant expenses addressing problems created by any such inadvertent disclosure or any security breaches of its network. Any compromise of customer information could subject us to customer or government litigation and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and growth.\nWe may not obtain sufficient patent protection for our systems, processes and technology, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in some regard upon the protection of our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2014, we held six issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States. Any patents issued may provide only limited protection for our technology and the rights that may be granted under any future issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us. Any patent applications may not result in issued patents. Also, patent protection in foreign countries may be limited or unavailable where we need this protection. Competitors may independently develop similar technologies, design around our patents or successfully challenge any issued patent that we hold.\nWe rely upon trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenues could be harmed.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our ability to compete and expand our business could suffer if these rights are not adequately protected. We seek to protect our source code for our software, design code for our advertising network, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We license our software under signed license agreements, which impose restrictions on the licensee\u2019s ability to use the software. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements. The steps taken by us to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology. Our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because:\n\u00b7\nlaws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies; and\n\u00b7\npolicing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use.\nThe laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the use of unregistered trademarks or our proprietary technologies to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. As a result, international protection of our image may be limited and our right to use our trademarks and technologies outside the United States could be impaired. Other persons or entities may have rights to trademarks that contain portions of our marks or may have registered similar or competing marks for digital signage in foreign countries. There may also be other prior registrations of trademarks identical or similar to our trademarks in other foreign countries. Our inability to register our trademarks or technologies or purchase or license the right to use the relevant trademarks or technologies in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to penetrate new markets in jurisdictions outside the United States.\nLitigation may be necessary to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, to enforce these rights or to defend against claims by third parties alleging that we infringe, dilute or otherwise violate third-party trademark or other intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, or whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property rights, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, if available at all or prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming, costly to defend and result in its loss of significant rights.\nOther parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us, and our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, we receive letters alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others. We may also initiate claims against third parties to defend our intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages to the party claiming infringement, develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business. Also, we may be unaware of filed patent applications that relate to our products. Parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction, which could prevent us from operating portions of our business or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property. Any intellectual property litigation could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on key executive management and other key personal, and may not be able to retain or replace these individuals or recruit additional personnel, which could harm our business.\nWe depend on the leadership and experience of our key executive management, as well as other key personnel with specialized industry, sales and technical knowledge and/or industry relationships. Because of the intense competition for these employees, particularly in certain of the metropolitan areas in which we operate, we may be unable to retain our management team and other key personnel and may be unable to find qualified replacements if their services were no longer available to us. Most of our key employees are employed on an \u201cat will\u201d basis and we do not have key-man life insurance covering any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive management members or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace such personnel on a timely basis or without incurring increased costs, or at all.\nOur facilities are located in areas that could be negatively impacted by natural disasters.\nOur business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities, computer systems and personnel, which are primarily located in Addison, Texas. In addition, we manage our networks from our headquarters in Addison and have significant operations in New York City. Addison is located in an area that experiences frequent severe weather, including tornadoes and New York City is a location that has experienced terrorist acts. Should a tornado, terrorist act or other catastrophe, such as fires, floods, power loss, communication failure or similar events, disable our facilities, our operations would be disrupted. While we have developed a backup and recovery plan, such plan may not ultimately prove effective.\nGovernment regulation of the telecommunications and advertising industries could require us to change our business practices and expose us to legal action.\nThe Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications industry. FCC licensing, program content and related regulations generally do not currently affect us. However, the FCC could promulgate new regulations that impact our business directly or indirectly or interpret existing laws in a manner that would cause us to incur significant compliance costs or force us to alter our business strategy.\nFCC regulations also affect many of our content providers and, therefore, these regulations may indirectly affect our business. In addition, the advertising industry is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug Administration and other federal and state agencies, and to review by various civic groups and trade organizations, including the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. New laws or regulations governing advertising could substantially harm our business.\nWe may also be required to obtain various regulatory approvals from local, state or federal governmental bodies. We may not be able to obtain any required approvals, and any approval may be granted on terms that are unacceptable to us or that adversely affect our business.\nChanges in regulations relating to Wi-Fi networks or other areas of the Internet may require us to alter our business practices or incur greater operating expenses.\nA number of regulations, including those referenced below, may impact our business as a result of our use of Wi-Fi networks. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, liability for distributing materials that infringe copyrights or other rights. Portions of the Communications Decency Act are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. The Child Online Protection Act and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. The costs of compliance with these regulations, and other regulations relating to our Wi-Fi networks or other areas of our business, may be significant. The manner in which these and other regulations may be interpreted or enforced may subject us to potential liability, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes to these and other regulations may impose additional burdens on us or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results because of, for example, increased costs relating to legal compliance, defense against adverse claims or damages, or the reduction or elimination of features, functionality or content from our Wi-Fi networks. Likewise, any failure on our part to comply with these and other regulations may subject us to additional liabilities.\nAny indebtedness we may incur could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our business or respond to changes, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations..\nAs of March 31, 2015, we had no outstanding debt. We may incur indebtedness in the future. Any indebtedness we may incur and the fact that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities could be needed to make payments on this indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7\nreducing the availability of our cash flow for our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, and other purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, which would place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u00b7\nfailing to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could result in all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable.\nOur ability to borrow any funds needed to operate and expand our business will depend in part on our ability to generate cash. Our ability to generate cash is subject to the performance of our business as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results, financial condition, and ability to expand our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, our inability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations in the future would require us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nAs of December 31, 2014, SCG Financial Holdings LLC (the \u201cSponsor\u201d) and affiliated persons (including Gregory H. Sachs, our Executive Chairman) and entities together beneficially owned almost 40% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these persons and entities have the ability to exercise control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and, if and when we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d will require that we have such system of internal controls audited. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or Stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nThe issuance of shares upon the conversion of our outstanding Series A preferred stock or the exercise of our outstanding options or warrants may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nOn March 26, 2015, we issued 250,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, which shares will automatically convert into an aggregate of 25 million shares of common stock upon receipt of stockholder approval of such conversion. In addition, as of March 31, 2015, outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,649,318 shares of our common stock, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, are exercisable. We also have options outstanding. The issuance of shares upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock or exercise of warrants and options may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nThe holders of our Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends under certain circumstances.\nIf the Stockholder Approval has not been obtained, and the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have not converted into shares of Common Stock, by May 25, 2015 (or by June 9, 2015 if the Securities and Exchange Commission\ncomments on the preliminary proxy materials filed by us in connection with seeking the Stockholder Approval, then commencing on the next business day holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate of 12% per annum calculated from the original issuance date, calculated based on a price of $100 per share (the \u201cStated Value\u201d), in preference and priority to the holders of all other classes or series of the Company\u2019s capital stock. If we are required to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, we may be obligated to pay significant sums of money, which could negatively affect our operations.\nOur Series A preferred stock has redemption requirements that may affect common stock holders.\nBeginning on March 26, 2016, if the Series A Preferred Stock has not converted into shares of common stock prior to that date, the requisite holders of the Series A preferred stock will have the right to elect to cause us to redeem, out of funds legally available therefore, all but not less than all of the then outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock, for a price per share equal to the Stated Value for such shares. If we are required to redeem our Series A preferred stock, we would have to expend significant amounts of funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may discourage or delay an acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, which could decrease the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware corporate law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include those that: authorize the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without a stockholder vote; limit stockholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings; establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and provide for staggered terms for our directors. In addition, in certain circumstances, Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe have not paid cash dividends to our shareholders and currently have no plans to pay future cash dividends.\nWe plan to retain earnings to finance future growth and have no current plans to pay cash dividends to shareholders. In addition, our credit facility restricts our ability to pay dividends. Because we have not paid cash dividends, holders of our securities will experience a gain on their investment in our securities only in the case of an appreciation of value of our securities. You should neither expect to receive dividend income from investing in our securities nor an appreciation in value.", "PERMNO": 13409, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "RMGN"}
