Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks, including those described below. You should consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Report, which could materially adversely affect our proposed operations, our business prospects, and financial condition, and the value of an investment in our business. There may be other factors that are not mentioned here or of which we are not presently aware that could also affect our business operations and prospects.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Capital Resources\n\u25cf We may incur significant cash payment and common stock issuance obligations under our agreements arising from our investments in Razor, Insight and Chronix.\n\u25cf We have incurred operating losses since inception, and we do not know if we will attain profitability.\n\u25cf It is likely that we will need to issue additional equity or debt securities in order to raise additional capital needed to pay our operating expenses.\n\u25cf Our rights to receive and retain certain payments from Burning Rock Biotech Limited under our Sublicense Agreement with them are subject to certain conditions.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\n\u25cf Our revenues in the near term will depend on our ability to commercialize a small number of diagnostic tests and to grow our Pharma Services business.\n\u25cf The research and development work we are doing is costly, time consuming, and uncertain as to its results.\n\u25cf Sales of our diagnostic tests could be adversely impacted by the reluctance of physicians to adopt the use of our tests and by the availability of competing diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf We have limited capital, marketing, sales, and regulatory compliance resources for the commercialization of our diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf We may face technology transfer challenges and expenses in adding new tests to our portfolio and in expanding our reach into new geographical areas on new instrument platforms.\n\u25cf If our laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable, or we are must vacate any facility, our ability to provide services and pursue our research and development and commercialization efforts may be jeopardized.\n\u25cf If we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\n\u25cf There is a limited number of manufacturers of molecular diagnostic testing equipment and related chemical reagents necessary for the provision of our diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf If we fail to enter into and maintain successful strategic alliances for diagnostic tests that we elect to co-develop, co-market, or out-license, we may have to reduce or delay our diagnostic test development or increase our expenditures.\n\u25cf We may become dependent on possible future collaborations to develop and commercialize many of our diagnostic test candidates and to provide the manufacturing, regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business.\n\u25cf Failure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks could harm our business.\n\u25cf Our business could be adversely affected if we lose the services of the key personnel upon whom we depend.\n\u25cf We have granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under a bank loan agreement.\n\u25cf Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.\n\u25cf Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, and could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\n\u25cf Failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\n\u25cf We are subject to laws and regulations governing corruption, which will require us to develop, maintain and implement costly compliance programs.\n\u25cf We may in the future be subject to litigation, which could harm our stock price, business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf We may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future, and difficulties integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u25cf We are subject to state laws in California that require gender and diversity quotas for boards of directors of public companies headquartered in California.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\u25cf Our operations as a clinical laboratory are subject to oversight by CMS under CLIA, as well as certain state agencies, and any failure to maintain our CLIA or applicable state permits and licenses may affect our ability to commercialize our diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf If the FDA takes the position that any of our tests are not within the scope of its policy on enforcement discretion for laboratory-developed tests, or otherwise determines that it will seek to actively regulate one or more of our diagnostic tests, responding to such a regulatory position could lead to delays in commercialization, or (if encountered after commercialization) requirements to halt the commercial provision of our tests until FDA marketing authorization is obtained.\n\u25cf We will also need to obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals for any IVDs that we may develop, in order to market those IVD tests.\n\u25cf Clinical trial failures can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf The commercial success of our diagnostic tests depends on the availability and sufficiency of third-party payer coverage and reimbursement, which may be limited or unavailable.\n\u25cf Changes in healthcare laws and policies may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u25cf Because of certain Medicare billing policies, we may not receive complete reimbursement for tests provided to Medicare patients.\n\u25cf Long payment cycles of Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers, or other payment delays, could hurt our cash flows and increase our need for working capital.\n\u25cf Private health insurance company policies may deny coverage or limit the amount they will reimburse us for the performance of our diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf We will be required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy of health information, and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties.\n\u25cf If we are successful in commercializing our diagnostic tests, we will be obligated to comply with numerous additional federal and state statutes and regulations pertaining to our business and be subject to government oversight and scrutiny for our compliance with such laws. Laboratory and health care regulatory compliance efforts are expensive and time-consuming, and failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws could result in enforcement action which could be detrimental to our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n\u25cf We rely on patents and trade secrets, and our financial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, protect our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\n\u25cf We may not be able to obtain patent protection for our diagnostic tests if our pending U.S. patent applications are found to be directed to unpatentable subject matter.\n\u25cf Changes to the patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf Other companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected, and our business would be harmed.\n\u25cf We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\n\u25cf We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n\u25cf If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our diagnostic tests.\n\u25cf Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our diagnostic tests for an adequate amount of time.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u00b7 The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic and the worldwide attempts to contain it could harm our business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by such pandemic.\n\u00b7 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and continues to affect our ability to conduct clinical trial activities.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u25cf The price of our stock may rise and fall rapidly.\n\u25cf A FASB accounting standard could increase the risk that our future financial statements could be qualified by going concern uncertainty.\n\u25cf Since we don\u2019t pay dividends, our stock may not be a suitable investment for those needing dividend income.\n\u25cf Securities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our shares.\n\u25cf You may experience dilution of your ownership interests if we issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock.\n\u25cf Our former parent company may sell its Oncocyte shares to raise capital to finance its operations.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Resources\nWe may incur significant cash payment and common stock issuance obligations under our agreements arising from our investments in Razor, Insight and Chronix.\nAs described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we have entered into certain agreements with Razor and its shareholders, including a Purchase Agreement, Minority Holder Stock Purchase Agreements, and a Development Agreement, under which we may incur significant cash payment and common stock issuance obligations. As described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we paid the amounts due to Razor under the Purchase Agreement and Minority Holder Stock Purchase Agreements.\nUnder the Development Agreement, upon completion of enrollment of the full number of patients for DetermaRx\u2122 Clinical Trial, Oncocyte will be obligated to issue to the Razor shareholders shares of Oncocyte common stock with an aggregate market value equal to $3 million at the date of issue.\nThe number of shares of Oncocyte common stock issuable under the Purchase Agreement, the Minority Holder Purchase Agreements, and the Development Agreement on a combined basis is limited to 19.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Oncocyte common stock or the outstanding voting power of Oncocyte shares as of the date of the Purchase Agreement, and if that number of shares has a value of less than $3 million on the date the Development Agreement obligation must be met, we would need to pay an amount of cash necessary to bring the combined value of cash and shares to $3 million to satisfy the Development Agreement obligation. The number of shares that may become issuable to satisfy the $3 million obligations cannot presently be determined because the number of shares will depend upon the market price of our common stock when the shares become issuable. The issuance of those shares of common stock will dilute the interests of our other common stockholders.\nUnder the Development Agreement, we are also obligated to pay the expenses of DetermaRx\u2122 Clinical Trial after Razor\u2019s $4 million Clinical Trial Expense Reserve has been exhausted. If within a specified time frame Encore is substantially responsible for obtaining funding to Oncocyte or Razor for the Clinical Trial from any third-party pharmaceutical company, a portion of such additional funding amount will be paid to Encore, subject to a $3 million cap on the payment to Encore if the funding is provided by a designated pharmaceutical company.\nIn addition, under the Merger Agreement pursuant to which we acquired Insight, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, we have agreed to pay contingent consideration of up to $6.0 million in any combination of cash or shares of Oncocyte common stock if certain milestones related to DetermaIO\u2122 are achieved (the \u201cContingent Consideration\u201d), which consist of (i) a $1.5 million clinical trial completion and data publication milestone, (ii) $3.0 million for an affirmative final local coverage determination from CMS for a specified lung cancer test, and (iii) up to $1.5 million for achieving certain CMS reimbursement milestones.\nAs additional consideration for the acquisition of Chronix, we have agreed to pay to holders of other classes and series of Chronix stock (i) up to $14 million in any combination of cash or Oncocyte common stock if certain milestones are achieved, (ii) earnout consideration of up to 15% of net collections for sales of specified tests and products during certain five to ten-year earnout periods, and (iii) up to 75% of net collections during a seven-year earnout period from the sale or license of Chronix\u2019s patents to a third party for use in transplantation medicine.\nTo meet these various cash payment obligations, we may need to sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities to raise the cash needed, or we may have to divert cash on hand that we would otherwise use for other business and operational purposes which could cause us to delay or reduce activities in the development and commercialization of our cancer tests. Any shares of common stock or other securities we sell to raise cash to meet our cash payment obligations will dilute the interests of our common stockholders.\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception, and we do not know if we will attain profitability.\nSince our inception in September 2009, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows in the future. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $64.1 million and $29.9 million, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $187.8 million as of December 31, 2021. We finance our operations primarily through sales of our common stock. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing that we may need, or that any such financing that may become available will be on terms that are favorable to us and our shareholders. Ultimately, our ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to earn a profit depends upon our success in developing and marketing or licensing our diagnostic tests and technology.\nIt is likely that we will need to issue additional equity or debt securities in order to raise additional capital needed to pay our operating expenses until such time as our revenues are sufficient to finance our operating expenses.\n\u25cf We plan to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses and we anticipate that we will be incurring significant sales and marketing costs as we develop and commercialize our diagnostic tests. Our research and development expenses may also increase if we work to develop tests for additional types of cancer or for other cancer related diagnostic purposes. The period of time for which our current cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to finance our operations will depend on the extent to which we expend funds on commercializing our tests and conducting new research and development programs. We will need to raise additional capital to pay operating expenses unless we are able to generate sufficient revenues from diagnostic test sales, royalties, and license fees to meet our operating expenses.\n\u25cf Our ability to raise additional equity or debt capital will depend not only on the successful completion of development of our diagnostic tests and receiving reimbursement approval from Medicare and other third-party payers for those tests, but also will depend on access to capital and conditions in the capital markets. Although we have received a Medicare reimbursement determination for DetermaRx\u2122, obtaining Medicare reimbursement approval for our other diagnostic tests could take two to three years, and investors may be reluctant to provide us with additional capital until we obtain Medicare reimbursement approval for those tests or until we can demonstrate that private payers such as health insurance companies or HMOs are willing to pay for the use of our diagnostic tests at prices sufficient for us to earn a reasonable return on our investments in our diagnostic test portfolio. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise capital at times and in amounts needed to finance the development and commercialization of our diagnostic tests and general operations. Even if capital is available, it may not be available on terms that we or our shareholders would consider favorable.\n\u25cf Sales or other issuances of additional equity securities by us could result in the dilution of the interests of our shareholders.\nOur rights to receive and retain certain payments from Burning Rock Biotech Limited under our Sublicense Agreement with them are subject to certain conditions.\nWe have entered into the Sublicense Agreement with Burning Rock, Razor and Razor\u2019s largest shareholder Encore Clinical Inc. pursuant to which rights to DetermaRx\u2122 in the Peoples Republic of China, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are sublicensed to Burning Rock. Under the Burning Rock Sublicense Agreement we are entitled to receive Initial Milestone Payments totaling $4 million subject to the successful transfer and installation of the DetermaRx\u2122 technology on Burning Rock\u2019s platforms, and additional payments if certain milestones are achieved. As of December 31, 2021, we have received $3 million of the Initial Milestone Payments, however, there is no assurance that the remaining transfer and installation of the DetermaRx\u2122 technology will be successfully completed within the time required by the Burning Rock Sublicense Agreement or that any of the additional payment milestones will be achieved. Further, even if we do receive the remaining $1 million of the Initial Milestone Payments, we will be obligated to refund to Burning Rock all or a portion of the Initial Milestone Payments if certain subsequent events occur, including events that are not within our control. The refund obligation will lapse in installments of $250,000 every three months after the completion date of the technology installation required to launch the DetermaRx\u2122 test, until the occurrence of an event trigger, the obligation to make a refund to Burning Rock or until March 31, 2025 when the refund obligation will expire in full.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur revenues in the near term will depend on our ability to commercialize a small number of diagnostic tests and to grow our Pharma Services business.\nOur near-term commercial efforts will focus on maximizing the opportunities for DetermaRx\u2122 and DetermaIO\u2122 and DetermaCNI\u2122, as well as increasing our Pharma Services business. Our reliance on a small group of diagnostic tests as sources of revenue could limit our future revenue, make it more difficult for us to finance our operations, and impair our prospects for profitability and growth. DetermaIO\u2122 is currently available only for biopharma diagnostic development and research use. We plan to continue DetermaIO\u2122 development, initially for use as a companion test in immunotherapy drug development to select patients for clinical trials, and subsequently as a full companion diagnostic for clinical use to help physicians determine which patients are most likely to have a sustained response to immunotherapies. We also plan to develop DetermaCNI\u2122 for clinical use if complete the Chronix merger. However, there is no assurance that our development plans for DetermaIO\u2122 or DetermaCNI\u2122 will be successful or that we will be generate sufficient revenues from commercialization of our diagnostic tests and from performing Pharma Services to finance our operations and earn a profit.\nThe research and development work we are doing is costly, time consuming, and uncertain as to its results.\nWe incurred research and development expenses amounting to approximately $13.6 million and $9.8 million during years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The current focus of our research and development efforts is a clinical trial of DetermaRx\u2122 and the development of DetermaIO\u2122 for clinical use. Other tests planned for our development pipeline include DetermaTx\u2122, DetermaMx\u2122 and DetermaCNI\u2122. If we are successful in developing a new technology or diagnostic tests for additional types of cancer, refinement of the new technology or diagnostic tests and definition of the practical applications and limitations of the technology or diagnostic tests may take years and require the expenditure of large sums of money. There is no assurance that we will be successful in completing the development of our current diagnostic tests or in developing additional diagnostic tests regardless of the amount of our expenditures.\nSales of our diagnostic tests could be adversely impacted by the reluctance of physicians to adopt the use of our tests and by the availability of competing diagnostic tests.\nPhysicians and hospitals may be reluctant to try a new diagnostic test due to the high degree of risk associated with the application of new technologies and diagnostic tests in the field of human medicine, especially if the new tests differ from the current standard of care for detecting cancer in patients. Competing tests for the initial diagnosis, reoccurrence diagnosis and optimal treatment of cancer are being manufactured and marketed by established companies and by other smaller biotechnology companies. In order to compete with other diagnostic tests, particularly any that sell at lower prices, our tests will have to provide medically significant advantages or be more cost effective. Even if we are able to overcome physician reluctance and compete with products that are currently on the market, our competitors may succeed in developing new safer, more accurate or more cost-effective diagnostic tests that could render our diagnostic tests and technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nWe have limited capital, marketing, sales, and regulatory compliance resources for the commercialization of our diagnostic tests.\nWe are building our own marketing and sales capability for our diagnostic tests, and are devoting significant financial and management resources to recruiting, training, and managing our sales force and building a health care regulatory compliance program. However, due to our limited capital resources, we may need to enter into marketing arrangements with other diagnostic companies for one or more of our tests in domestic or foreign markets. Under such marketing arrangements we may license marketing rights to one or more of our diagnostic tests to other diagnostic companies or to one or more joint venture companies that may be formed to market our tests, and we might receive only a royalty on sales or an equity interest in a joint venture company. As a result, our revenues from the sale of our tests through such arrangements may be substantially less than the amount of revenues and gross profits that we might receive if we were to market our tests ourselves.\nWe may face technology transfer challenges and expenses in adding new tests to our portfolio and in expanding our reach into new geographical areas on new instrument platforms.\nOur plan for expanding our business includes developing and acquiring additional tests that can be transferred into our current lab footprint in the US and/or onto molecular testing instrument platforms for distribution in ex-US markets. Due to differences in the hardware and software platforms available at different laboratories for running molecular tests, we may need to make adjustments to the configuration of the reagents that make up our LDTs in our US labs or as we convert them to kits, and there may be changes to the related software in order for the tests to be performed on particular hardware platforms. Making any such adjustments could take a considerable amount of time and expense, and there will be no assurance that we will succeed in running our tests on the hardware and software that we may encounter in different laboratories. To manage this issue and to attain uniformity among our laboratory locations, we may license or acquire our own instrument system and software from another company that has a platform that will be compatible with our tests. In addition to acquisition costs, operationally we will have to build out infrastructure for installing a new testing platform across multiple laboratory locations as well as support functions to help maintain these instrument systems in new customer labs, and we may also encounter unexpected technology issues in the process.\nIf our laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable, or we are required to vacate any facility, our ability to provide services and pursue our research and development and commercialization efforts may be jeopardized.\nWe currently have clinical laboratory facilities in Irvine, California, and Nashville, Tennessee. We also acquired a laboratory in Germany through merger with Chronix. Our facilities and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes and power outages, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to perform our tests or provide laboratory services for some period of time. The inability to perform our tests or the backlog of tests that could develop if any of our facilities is inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation or relationships with key researchers, collaborators, and customers, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work could be costly and time-consuming to repair or replace.\nAdditionally, a key component of our research and development process involves using biological samples and the resulting data sets and medical histories, as the basis for our diagnostic test development. In some cases, these samples are difficult to obtain. If the parts of our laboratory facilities where we store these biological samples are damaged or compromised, our ability to pursue our research and development projects, commercialization of our diagnostic tests, as well as our reputation, could be jeopardized. We carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFurther, if our laboratories become inoperable, we may not be able to license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third-party, with established state licensure and CLIA certification under the scope of which our diagnostic tests could be performed following validation and other required procedures, to perform the tests. Even if we find a third-party with such qualifications to perform our tests, such party may not be willing to perform the tests for us on commercially reasonable terms. Moreover, we believe our tests are currently subject to enforcement discretion by the FDA because we believe the tests currently qualify as LDTs. If, however, we are required to find a third-party laboratory to conduct our testing services, we believe this would change our status and the FDA would consider such tests offered through a third-party to then be a medical device subject to active FDA regulation and enforcement under its in vitro diagnostic authorities. In that case, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance or approval prior to offering our tests, which would be time-consuming and costly and could result in interruptions and delays in our ability to sell or offer our tests.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\nRazor has rights to commercialize DetermaRx\u2122 under a license which imposes certain obligations, including payment obligations and obligations to pursue development and commercialization of diagnostic tests under the licensed patents and technology. If the licensor believes that Razor and Oncocyte as Razor\u2019s sublicensee have failed to meet those contractual obligations it could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation our ability to continue marketing DetermaRx\u2122, and our ability to raise any capital that we might then need, could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were lost, we would not be able to continue to use the licenses needed for DetermaRx\u2122 in our business. Even if the licensor were to elect to convert our exclusive license to non-exclusive rights rather than terminating our license as a result of our failure to meet a license agreement obligation, the loss of exclusivity might result in our loss of revenue to any competitors that might acquire rights from the licensor to use the licensed patents in competition with us.\nThere is a limited number of manufacturers of molecular diagnostic testing equipment and related chemical reagents necessary for the provision of our diagnostic tests.\nAfter encountering inconsistent results using diagnostic testing equipment and reagents from one manufacturer, we switched to diagnostic testing equipment from a different manufacturer. The chemical reagents used with the diagnostic testing equipment are available only from the equipment manufacturer. If issues were to arise with the new equipment or if reagents we are using causing us to acquire different diagnostic testing equipment again, we would need to conduct validation and analytic studies to determine whether our previous test results can be reproduced using the new equipment. As a result, we could experience delays again in developing our diagnostic tests. If similar issues were to arise after commercialization of a diagnostic test, we could experience a disruption for a period of time in providing the diagnostic tests to patients and we would lose revenues and potentially market share as a result.\nIf we fail to enter into and maintain successful strategic alliances for diagnostic tests that we elect to co-develop, co-market, or out-license, we may have to reduce or delay our diagnostic test development or increase our expenditures.\nIn order to facilitate the development, manufacture and commercialization of our diagnostic tests we may enter into strategic alliances with diagnostic, pharmaceutical, or medical device companies to advance our programs and enable us to maintain our financial and operational capacity. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances. We may not be able to negotiate alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. If we fail to create and maintain suitable alliances, we may have to limit the size or scope of, or delay, one or more of our product development or research programs, or we will have to increase our expenditures and will need to obtain additional funding, which may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms.\nIf we are able to enter into development and marketing arrangements with diagnostic, pharmaceutical or medical device companies for our diagnostic tests, we may license product development, manufacturing, and marketing rights to the pharmaceutical or medical device company or to a joint venture company formed with the pharmaceutical or medical device company. Under such arrangements we might receive only a royalty on sales of the diagnostic tests developed or an equity interest in a joint venture company that develops the diagnostic test. As a result, our revenues from the sale of those diagnostic tests may be substantially less than the amount of revenues and gross profits that we might receive if we were to develop, manufacture, and market the diagnostic tests ourselves.\nWe may become dependent on possible future collaborations to develop and commercialize many of our diagnostic test candidates and to provide the manufacturing, regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business.\nWe may enter into various kinds of collaborative research and development, manufacturing, and diagnostic test marketing agreements to develop and commercialize our diagnostic tests. Any future milestone payments and cost reimbursements from collaboration agreements could provide an important source of financing for our research and development programs, thereby facilitating the application of our technology to the development and commercialization of our diagnostic tests, but there are risks associated with entering into collaboration arrangements.\nThere is a risk that we could become dependent upon one or more collaborative arrangements for diagnostic test development or manufacturing or as a source of revenues from the sale of any diagnostic tests that may be developed by us alone or through one of the collaborative arrangements. A collaborative arrangement upon which we might depend might be terminated by our collaboration partner or they might determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of our diagnostic tests. A collaboration partner also may not be precluded from independently pursuing competing diagnostic tests or technologies.\nThere is a risk that a collaboration partner might fail to perform its obligations under the collaborative arrangements or may be slow in performing its obligations. In addition, a collaboration partner may experience financial difficulties at any time that could prevent it from having available funds to contribute to the collaboration. If a collaboration partner fails to conduct its diagnostic test development, manufacturing, commercialization, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner, or if it terminates or materially modifies its agreements with us, the development and commercialization of one or more diagnostic test candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue diagnostic test development, manufacturing, and commercialization on our own.\nFailure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, could harm our business.\nWe cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking are sufficient to protect our trademark rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over trademark rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Challenges to our trademarks could result in significant costs related to the prosecution or defense of the registrations of our trademarks or rebranding if we need to abandon or modify a trademark.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose the services of the key personnel upon whom we depend.\nWe presently rely on a small senior management team to direct our diagnostics program and our initial commercial activities. Accordingly, the loss of the services of one or more of the members of that management team could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have granted a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under a bank loan agreement.\nWe have entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank for a loan that is secured by substantially all of our assets, other than our patents and trade secrets, as collateral for the loan. If a default were to arise under the Loan and Security Agreement, the bank could foreclose on its security interest and we could lose our collateral, which could force us to discontinue our operations.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems, including a combination of on-site systems, managed data center systems, cloud-based systems, and the Internet, for significant elements of our operations, including processing, transmitting, and storing a wide variety of business-critical information. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, ransomware, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations, downtime of our information technology or telecommunications systems or those used by our third-party service providers, and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, the loss of data for our diagnostic test candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability under federal or state laws, be subject to litigation, and the development of our diagnostic test candidates could be delayed.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, and could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our business partners, PHI, and personally identifiable information of patients and employees. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site systems, managed data center systems and cloud-based systems. We also communicate PHI and other sensitive data through our various tools and platforms. In addition to storing and transmitting sensitive data that is subject to legal protections, these applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information, including research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.\nWe face a number of risks relative to protecting our information, including loss of access, inappropriate disclosure, inappropriate modification, and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor and modify our controls over our critical information. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure are also vulnerable to attacks by hackers, viruses, ransomware or breaches due to employee error, technical error, malfeasance, or other disruptions.\nThese types of problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, intentional or accidental human actions or omissions, software errors, malware, security attacks, fraud, spikes in customer usage and denial of service issues. From time to time, large third-party web hosting providers have also experienced outages or other problems that have resulted in their systems being offline and inaccessible. In addition to data security risks, we also face privacy risks. Should we actually violate, or be perceived to have violated, any privacy promises we make to patients or consumers, we could be subject to a complaint from an affected individual or interested privacy regulator, such as the FTC or a state Attorney General. This risk is heightened given the sensitivity of the data we collect.\nAny problems that may arise in connection with our data and systems, including those that are hosted by third-party providers, could result in interruptions to our business and operations or exposure to security vulnerabilities. Any such breach or interruption, whether of our systems or that of our third-party service providers or their subcontractors, could also compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, theft, or other loss of information or privacy or security compromise could result in legal claims or proceedings or liability under federal or state laws that protect the privacy or security of personal information, including HIPAA, HITECH, and state data security and data breach notification laws. Any data privacy or security event could also disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIf a privacy or security event occurs, we may be required to comply with state breach notification laws and become subject to mandatory corrective action. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA or HITECH vary significantly, and, depending on the knowledge and culpability of the HIPAA-regulated entity, may include civil monetary penalties of up to $1.5 million per calendar year for each provision of HIPAA that is violated. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Penalties for unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act or state Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices statutes may also vary significantly.\nAlso, even if we do not incur an interruption of or our operations, fines, penalties, or financial liability to third parties from a security breach, we could suffer a loss of confidence in our services, which could adversely affect our business and competitive position. A security event could also result in the compromise of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. Our growth and entry into new diagnostic tests, technologies and markets will place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. Because we are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from the requirement of having our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accountants, which means that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls that might be detected by an audit may not be detected and remedied.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing corruption, which will require us to develop, maintain, and implement costly compliance programs.\nWe must comply with a wide range of laws and regulations to prevent corruption, bribery, and other unethical business practices, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other countries. The creation and implementation of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required.\nAnti-bribery laws prohibit us, our employees, and some of our agents or representatives from offering or providing any personal benefit to covered government officials to influence their performance of their duties or induce them to serve interests other than the missions of the public organizations in which they serve. Certain commercial bribery rules also prohibit offering or providing any personal benefit to employees and representatives of commercial companies to influence their performance of their duties or induce them to serve interests other than their employers. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the United States Department of Justice. The SEC is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.\nCompliance with these anti-bribery laws is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the anti-bribery laws present particular challenges in the medical industry because in many countries including China, hospitals are state-owned or operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign government officials. Furthermore, in certain countries (China in particular), hospitals and clinics are permitted to sell pharmaceuticals to their patients and are primary or significant distributors of pharmaceuticals. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical studies, procurement of pharmaceuticals and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials that have led to vigorous anti-bribery law enforcement actions and heavy fines in multiple jurisdictions, particularly in the U.S. and China.\nIt is not always possible to identify and deter violations, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nIn the medical industry, corrupt practices include, among others, offering or accepting kickbacks, bribes or other illegal gains or benefits by the hospitals and medical practitioners from manufacturers of pharmaceutical or other products, distributors or their third-party agents in connection with the prescription of certain pharmaceuticals or sale of products. If our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms violate these laws or otherwise engage in illegal practices with respect to their sales or marketing of our products or other activities involving our products, we could be required to pay damages or heavy fines by multiple jurisdictions where we operate, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There have been recent occurrences in which certain hospitals have denied access to sales representatives from pharmaceutical companies because the hospitals wanted to avoid the perception of corruption. If this attitude becomes widespread among our potential customers, our ability to promote our products to hospitals may be adversely affected.\nIf we and our subsidiaries expand operations internationally, we will need to increase the scope of our compliance programs to address the risks relating to the potential for violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and data protection laws. Our compliance programs will need to include policies addressing not only the FCPA, but also the provisions of a variety of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in multiple foreign jurisdictions, provisions relating to books and records that apply to us as a public company, and include effective training for our personnel throughout our organization. The creation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required. Violation of the FCPA and other anti-corruption and data privacy laws can result in significant administrative and criminal penalties for us and our employees, including substantial fines, suspension or debarment from government contracting, prison sentences, or even the death penalty in extremely serious cases in certain countries. The SEC also may suspend or bar us from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violation of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions. Even if we are not ultimately punished by government authorities, the costs of investigation and review, distraction of our personnel, legal defense costs, and harm to our reputation could be substantial and could limit our profitability or our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. In addition, if any of our competitors are not subject to the FCPA, they may engage in practices that will lead to their receipt of preferential treatment from foreign hospitals and enable them to secure business from foreign hospitals in ways that are unavailable to us.\nWe may in the future be subject to litigation, which could harm our stock price, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to litigation in the future. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock, many companies, including us, have been the subjects of securities class action litigation. Any such litigation can result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business results of operations and financial condition. As a result of these factors, holders of our common stock might be unable to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for such shares.\nWe may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future, and difficulties integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may acquire businesses or assets that complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising products or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to move one or more products through preclinical and/or clinical development to regulatory approval and commercialization. Integrating any newly acquired businesses or technologies could be expensive and time-consuming, resulting in the diversion of resources from our current business. We may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully. We cannot assure that, following an acquisition, we will achieve revenues, specific net income or loss levels that justify the acquisition or that the acquisition will result in increased earnings, or reduced losses, for the combined company in any future period. Moreover, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses, which would result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness and may not be available on terms which would otherwise be acceptable to us. We may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably or otherwise implement our growth strategy successfully.\nWe are subject to state laws in California that require gender and diversity quotas for boards of directors of public companies headquartered in California.\nIn September 2018, California enacted SB 826, requiring public companies headquartered in California to maintain minimum female representation on their boards of directors as follows: by December 31, 2019, public company boards must have a minimum of one female director; by December 31, 2021, public company boards with five members were required to have at least two female directors, and public company boards with six or more members were required to have at least three female directors.\nAdditionally, on September 30, 2020, California enacted AB 979, requiring public companies with principal executive offices in California to each have at least one director from an underrepresented community based on ethnicity and sexual orientation by December 31, 2021. A director from an \u201cunderrepresented community\u201d means a director who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. By December 31, 2022, each of these companies will be required to have at least two directors from such underrepresented communities if such company has more than four but fewer than nine directors, or at least three directors from underrepresented communities if the company has nine or more directors.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have not yet met the requirement to have three female directors on our board. Although we intend to be in compliance on or before December 31, 2022, we cannot assure that we can recruit, attract and/or retain qualified members of the board and continue to meet gender and diversity quotas as required by California law (provided that such laws are not repealed before the compliance deadlines), which may cause certain investors to divert their holdings in our securities and expose us to financial penalties and/or reputational harm.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur operations as a clinical laboratory in the United States are subject to oversight by CMS under CLIA, as well as certain state agencies, and our operation of clinical laboratories in any foreign jurisdictions are subject to similar regulatory oversight. Any failure to maintain our CLIA or applicable state or international permits and licenses may affect our ability to commercialize our diagnostic tests.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a federal law regulating clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. Our clinical laboratories must be certified under CLIA in order for us to perform testing on human specimens. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. We have a current certificate under CLIA to perform routine chemistry. To renew these certificates, our diagnostic laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make periodic inspections of our clinical laboratories outside of the renewal process.\nThe law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in the states in which are laboratories are located. State laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, several states require that we hold licenses to test specimens from patients in those states. We do not have immediate plans to market our tests for commercial use in the European Union and as a result, at this time we do not believe we are subject to EU or EU member state post-market regulations related to our tests.\nIf we were to lose our CLIA certification or a required state license for a laboratory, whether as a result of a revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to offer our tests from the affected laboratory, which would limit our revenue and harm our business. If we were to lose our license in other states where we are required to hold licenses, we would not be able to test specimens from those states. If we perform testing on samples originating in a state where we require a license, but do not currently have one, we could be subject to fines, sanctions, and may be denied permits or licenses in the future.\nWe also maintain laboratory operations in Germany and could expand our laboratory operations to other foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, we are subject to laboratory quality regulations and accreditation standards in Germany, and will be subject to such regulations and standards in any other jurisdictions where we may operate. These requirements may vary by jurisdiction and differ from those in the United States, and may require us to implement additional compliance measures. If we fail to comply with any foreign jurisdiction\u2019s applicable laboratory regulations and standards it could limit our revenue and harm or business and we could be subject to fines and other sanctions.\nIf the FDA takes the position that any of our tests are not within the scope of its policy on enforcement discretion for laboratory-developed tests, or otherwise determines that it will seek to actively regulate one or more of our diagnostic tests, responding to such a regulatory position could lead to delays in commercialization, or (if encountered after commercialization) requirements to halt the commercial provision of our tests until FDA marketing authorization is obtained.\nAlthough the FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion over most LDTs, it does not consider tests to be subject to this enforcement discretion if they were or are designed or manufactured completely, or partly, outside of the laboratory that offers and uses them, or if they are offered \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (as opposed to being available to patients only when prescribed by a health care provider). In recent years, however, the FDA has stated it intends to end its policy of general enforcement discretion and regulate certain LDTs as medical devices. To this end, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents, entitled \u201cFramework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)\u201d and \u201cFDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),\u201d respectively, that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. Subsequently, on January 13, 2017, the FDA published a \u201cdiscussion paper\u201d in which it outlined a substantially revised \u201cpossible approach\u201d to the oversight of LDTs.\nIn August 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the parent agency for FDA, announced that the FDA \u201cwill not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, as opposed to through guidance documents, compliance manuals, website statements, or other informal issuances.\u201d It is unclear at this time whether this policy will be retained the Biden Administration, and if so, when the FDA might seek to begin the notice and comment rulemaking process.\nLegislative proposals addressing the FDA\u2019s oversight of LDTs have been introduced in previous Congresses, and we expect that new legislative proposals may be introduced from time-to-time. The likelihood that Congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the FDA\u2019s plans to regulate certain LDTs as medical devices is difficult to predict at this time.\nIn March 2020, a bill titled the \u201cVerifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development Act of 2020,\u201d or VALID Act, was officially introduced in Congress. The bill proposes a risk-based approach to regulate LDTs and creates a new in vitro clinical test, or IVCT, category of regulated products, which includes LDTs, and a regulatory structure under the FDA. As proposed, the bill grandfathers many existing tests from the proposed premarket approval, quality systems, and labeling requirements, respectively, but would require such tests to comply with other regulatory requirements (e.g., registration and listing, adverse event reporting). Later that month, Senator Paul introduced the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories Act of 2020, or VITAL Act, which proposes that all aspects of \u201claboratory-developed testing procedures\u201d be subject to regulation under CLIA, and that no aspects of such procedures be subject to regulation by the FDA. We cannot predict if either of these bills will be enacted in their current (or any other) form and cannot quantify the effect of these bills on our business.\nIf the FDA were to determine that our tests are not within the policy for LDTs for any reason, including new rules, policies, or guidance, or due to new legislation such as the proposed VALID Act, our tests may become subject to FDA requirements, including pre-market review. If required, the regulatory marketing authorization process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and submitting a pre-market clearance (510(k)) submission or filing a de novo or pre-market approval application with the FDA. If pre-market review and approval is required by the FDA, we may need to incur additional expenses or require additional time to seek it, or we may be unable to satisfy FDA standards, and our tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, and the labeling claims permitted by the FDA may not be consistent with our currently planned claims or adequate to support adoption of and reimbursement for our tests. Ongoing compliance with FDA regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to inspection by and the regulatory requirements of the FDA, for example registration and listing, adherence to good manufacturing practices under the Quality System Regulation, and medical device reporting, and enforcement action in the event we fail to comply with these requirements. Our laboratories are operating under CLIA and are not currently operating as device manufacturing facilities following FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation. Because these standards differ, we may face challenges establishing FDA-compliant quality systems or be unable to do so. If after commercialization under the LDT framework our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the regulatory status of our tests, including questions that may be raised if competitors object to our regulatory positioning as an LDT, we may encounter ongoing regulatory and legal challenges and related costs. Such challenges or related developments (for example if the labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are more limited than the claims we currently plan to make) may impact our commercialization efforts as orders or reimbursement may be less than anticipated. Any of these regulatory developments may cause our business to suffer.\nWe will also need to obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals for any IVDs that we may develop, in order to market those IVD tests.\nIf we decide to develop IVDs, we will need to obtain regulatory clearance or approval to market each new IVD test. This means that:\n\u25cf The IVDs that we may develop cannot be sold until the CMS or the FDA, and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities approve or authorize the laboratory tests or the IVDs for medical use.\n\u25cf We will have to conduct expensive and time-consuming clinical trials of new diagnostic tests. The full cost of conducting and completing clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA clearance or approval of IVD tests or for gaining reimbursement from health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, Medicare, and other third-party payers cannot be presently determined but could exceed our financial resources.\n\u25cf Data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory agency clearances or approvals. Delays or denials of the regulatory clearances or approvals may be encountered as a result of changes in regulatory agency policy, regulations, or laws.\n\u25cf A diagnostic test that is cleared or approved for marketing may be subject to restrictions on use.\n\u25cf The FDA can withdraw approval of an FDA regulated product if problems arise.\nClinical trial failures can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future diagnostic tests.\nClinical trial failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf Delays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials;\n\u25cf Delays in obtaining Institutional Review Board and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf Slower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u25cf Limited or no availability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third-party payers for the use of our diagnostic test candidates in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf Negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u25cf Approval and introduction of new diagnostic or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u25cf Inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u25cf Inability to replicate in large controlled studies safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials; and\n\u25cf Inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nThe commercial success of our diagnostic tests depends on the availability and sufficiency of third-party payer coverage and reimbursement, which may be limited or unavailable.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our diagnostic tests will depend, in significant part, on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels can be obtained for patients. Physicians will be hesitant to order a diagnostic test for a patient when they may be left with a large out-of-pocket fee through co-payments or co-insurance or unreimbursed balances. Third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, are increasingly challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and services. In addition, legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs may result in lower prices or the actual inability of prospective customers to purchase our tests. Furthermore, even if reimbursement is available, it may not be available at price levels sufficient for us to realize a positive return on our investment. We have never successfully obtained reimbursement for any test and may never be able to obtain reimbursement from any third-party payer; without such coverage and reimbursement, we may not achieve market acceptance of our test and may never be profitable.\nThe United States government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit one or more of our diagnostic tests from coverage. Even if a diagnostic test receives coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, such coverage policies and reimbursement rates may change at any time, might not be adequate, or less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement for a diagnostic test, its commercial success may be greatly hindered, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may need to conduct additional studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our diagnostic tests to the satisfaction of our target customers and their third-party payers. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources\nChanges in healthcare laws and policies may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect us. For instance, the payment reductions imposed by the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) and the expansion of the federal and state governments\u2019 role in the U.S. healthcare industry as well as changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by payers for our tests and future tests and products may reduce our profits and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Notably, Congress enacted legislation in 2017 that eliminated the ACA\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d beginning in 2019, which may significantly impact the number of covered lives participating in exchange plans. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the ACA, although it is unclear when a decision will be made. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action be taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency.\nPAMA significantly altered the payment methodology under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule that determines Medicare coverage for laboratory tests. Under PAMA (as amended by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, respectively) and its implementing regulations, clinical laboratories must report to CMS private payer rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. Laboratories that fail to timely report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil money penalties. Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are paid based upon these reported private payer rates. For certain clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are not designated as advanced diagnostic laboratory tests, initial payment rates will be assigned by the cross-walk or gap-fill methodology. For laboratory tests that are designated as new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests initial payment rates will be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test. On December 10, 2021 CMS reported that the payment rates calculated under PAMA will be held at 2020 levels during 2022, and then, where applicable based upon median private payer rates reported, reduced by up to 15% per test year in each of 2023 through 2025, with a second round of private payer rate reporting between January 1, 2022 and March 31, 2022 to establish the 2023 through 2025 rates. Thereafter, additional data collection and reporting obligations are scheduled to continue on an every third subsequent calendar year cycle to establish the payment rates.\nBecause of certain Medicare billing policies, we may not receive complete reimbursement for tests provided to Medicare patients.\nMedicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that the test or assay is approved as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, neither the supplier nor any other party, such as a diagnostic laboratory, may receive reimbursement from Medicare for the service. Regional policies are directed by Medicare\u2019s regional MACs. Reimbursement for our diagnostic testing may be negatively impacted by California MAC policies.\nLong payment cycles of Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers, or other payment delays, could hurt our cash flows and increase our need for working capital.\nMedicare and Medicaid have complex billing and documentation requirements that we will have to satisfy in order to receive payment. Failure to comply with these requirements and other laws applicable to billing may result in, among other things, non-payment, refunds, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. Similarly, the failure of private health insurers or other private third-party payers to properly process our payment claims in a timely manner could delay our receipt of payment for our diagnostic tests and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nPrivate health insurance company policies may deny coverage or limit the amount they will reimburse us for the performance of our diagnostic tests.\nPatients who are not covered by Medicare will generally rely on health insurance provided by private health insurance companies. If we are considered a \u201cnon-contracted provider\u201d by a third-party payer, that payer may not reimburse patients for diagnostic tests performed by us, or doctors within the payer\u2019s network of covered physicians may not use our services to perform diagnostic tests for their patients. As a result, we may need to enter into contracts with health insurance companies or other private payers to provide diagnostic tests to their insured patients at specified rates of reimbursement which may be lower than the rates we might otherwise collect.\nWe will be required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy of health information, and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties.\nHIPAA sets forth security regulations that establish administrative, physical and technical standards for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Protected Health Information in electronic form. We also may be required to comply with state laws that are more stringent than HIPAA or that provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their health care records. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d) established certain health information security breach notification obligations that require covered entities to notify each individual whose \u201cprotected health information\u201d is breached.\nWe may incur significant compliance costs related to HIPAA and HITECH privacy regulations and varying state privacy regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. Given the complexity of HIPAA and HITECH and their overlap with state privacy and security laws, and the fact that these laws are rapidly evolving and are subject to changing and potentially conflicting interpretation, our ability to comply with the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy requirements is uncertain and the costs of compliance are significant. The costs of complying with any changes to the HIPAA, HITECH and state privacy restrictions may have a negative impact on our operations. Noncompliance could subject us to criminal penalties, civil sanctions and significant monetary penalties as well as reputational damage.\nIf we are successful in commercializing our diagnostic tests, we will be obligated to comply with numerous additional federal and state statutes and regulations pertaining to our business and be subject to government oversight and scrutiny for our compliance with such laws. Laboratory and health care regulatory compliance efforts are expensive and time-consuming, and failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws could result in enforcement action which could be detrimental to our business.\nIf we are successful in commercializing any of our diagnostic tests, and particularly if payment becomes available from government or commercial payers for a test, we will be subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws governing various aspects of our business. We will be subject to ongoing compliance with laws addressing our laboratory licensure and certification at the federal and state level; advertising and promotion (including laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission); and laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in healthcare programs (including among others the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (EKRA), the Stark Law, and applicable state law equivalents).\nThese laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. If one or more such agencies alleges that we may be in violation of any of these requirements, regardless of the outcome, it could damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, and in some circumstances we could be required to refund payments received by us from payers, or even be excluded from participation in healthcare programs. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.\nWe plan to adopt policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Developing a compliance infrastructure is costly and time-consuming, and even a well-designed and implemented compliance program cannot necessarily prevent all violations of relevant laws. We may be subject to enforcement action based on the actions or omissions of employees or contractors, including our anticipated sales force.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe rely on patents and trade secrets, and our financial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, protect our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nWe rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the United States and certain foreign countries. We may also use license agreements both to access technologies developed by other companies and universities and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, protect our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.\nWe may not be able to obtain patent protection for our diagnostic test if our pending U.S. patent applications are found to be directed to unpatentable subject matter.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. For example, recent cases have held that diagnostic methods merely reciting a correlation between a naturally occurring event and a diagnostic outcome associated with that event is not patentable subject matter. If our pending U.S. patent applications are found to be directed to unpatentable subject matter by the USPTO, or any patents issuing from our pending patent applications are invalidated based on these decisions, we may be unable to prevent competitors from using the biomarkers or other subject matter disclosed in the patent applications to develop similar diagnostic tests that would compete with our tests. Additionally, there have been recent proposals for additional changes to the patent laws of the United States and other countries that, if adopted, could impact our ability to enforce our proprietary technology. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nChanges to the patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our diagnostic tests.\nOur success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. Patent reform legislation in the United States and other countries, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, signed into law in September 2011, could increase those uncertainties and costs. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. In addition, the Leahy-Smith Act has transformed the U.S. patent system into a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system. The first-to-file provisions, however, only became effective in March 2013. Accordingly, it is not yet clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could make it more difficult to obtain patent protection for our inventions and increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our collaboration partners\u2019 patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our collaboration partners\u2019 issued patents, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOther companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our diagnostic tests.\nAny patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and declared invalid or infringing of third-party claims. A patent interference proceeding may be instituted with the USPTO when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent filed before March 16, 2013. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO will determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTO\u2019s decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delay in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us. In addition to interference proceedings, the USPTO can review issued patents at the request of a third party seeking to have the patent invalidated. An inter partes review proceeding allows third parties to challenge the validity of an issued patent where there is a reasonable likelihood of invalidity. This means that patents owned or licensed by us may be subject to administrative review and may be lost if the outcome of the review is unfavorable to us.\nPost Grant Review under the Leahy-Smith Act makes available opposition-like proceedings in the United States. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, Post Grant Review proceedings will be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining patent protection or can result in a denial of a patent application. Further, a derivation proceeding may be instituted by the USPTO or an inventor alleging that a patent or application was derived from the work of another inventor.\nOppositions to the issuance of patents may be filed under European patent law and the patent laws of certain other countries. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, these foreign proceedings can be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining a patent or can result in a denial of a patent application.\nThe enforcement of patent rights often requires litigation against third party infringers, and such litigation can be costly to pursue. Even if we succeed in having new patents issued or in defending any challenge to issued patents, our patents may not be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection against our competitors.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected, and our business would be harmed.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position. The molecular diagnostics that we are developing use gene expression classifiers or algorithms, which are mathematical models that weight the biomarkers to produce a score. We will treat the mathematical models as trade secrets. We have entered into intellectual property, invention, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, and it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants. These measures, however, may not prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and know-how, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets and know-how or obtain access to our trade secrets, know-how, or proprietary technology.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. In any patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. Even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court may construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question, in which case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nEven if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Moreover, we may not have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents, if issued, on our diagnostic test candidate in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our diagnostic tests in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents or where any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us.\nMoreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws. Additionally, laws of some countries outside of the United States and Europe do not afford intellectual property protection to the same extent as the laws of the United States and Europe. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, including India, China and certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in certain countries outside the United States and Europe. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, if our ability to enforce our patents to stop infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our diagnostic test, and our patents, if issued, or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and resources from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in major markets for our diagnostic test, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our diagnostic tests. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our diagnostic tests.\nThere is a substantial amount of intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adversarial proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or future diagnostic test, including interference proceedings before the USPTO, misappropriation claims, or other allegations. The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. For example, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our diagnostic tests or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nIn addition, several of our employees have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements with their previous employers, who may allege these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs, and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could significantly harm our business and operating results. We may also not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to pay monetary damages, lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, or be forced to cease developing, manufacturing or commercializing the infringing diagnostic test. Alternatively, we may be required to obtain a license from such third party in order to use the infringing technology and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing the infringing diagnostic test. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our diagnostic tests or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our diagnostic tests for an adequate amount of time.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new diagnostic tests, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, which is limited to the approved indication or any additional indications approved during the period of extension. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nRisks Related to the Covid-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic and the worldwide attempts to contain it could harm our business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by such pandemic.\nThe ongoing global outbreak of the coronavirus COVID-19, and the various attempts throughout the world to contain it, have created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, significant effects on our operations, ability to generate revenues, and financing activities. In response to government directives and guidelines, health care advisories and employee and other concerns, we have altered certain aspects of our operations. A number of our employees have had to work remotely from home and those on site have had to follow our social distance guidelines, which could impact their productivity. COVID-19 could also disrupt our operations due to absenteeism by infected or ill members of management or other employees, or absenteeism by members of management and other employees who cannot effectively work remotely but who elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or laboratory facilities, or due to quarantines. COVID-19 illness could also impact members of our Board of Directors resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors, and making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full Board of Directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.\nThe pandemic is affecting our revenue-generating activities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have not been able, and may continue to not be able, to maintain our preferred level of physician or customer outreach and marketing of our diagnostic testing and Pharma Services, which may have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our potential new customers\u2019 interest in our tests and services. Because of COVID-19, travel, visits, and in-person meetings related to our business have been severely curtailed or canceled and we have instead used on-line or virtual meetings to meet with potential customers and others.\nThe concern over available hospital, staffing, equipment, and other resources, and the risk of exposure to the virus, has led to early-stage lung cancer surgeries being delayed, and the continued deferral of lung cancer surgeries could result in delayed or reduced use of DetermaRx\u2122 in the near term. Even if COVID-19 related restrictions are relaxed and lung cancer surgeries are performed at or close to pre-pandemic levels, any growth and anticipated adoption of our diagnostic tests may not occur due to reasons other than COVID-19.\nThe consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to uncertainties related to our business growth and our ability to forecast the demand for our diagnostic testing and Pharma Services and resulting revenues. We had no commercial revenues until the first quarter of 2020 when we launched of our first commercial diagnostic test, DetermaRxTM, and acquired the Pharma Services business of Insight. We had expected that initial DetermaRx\u2122 revenues would be constrained by the lack of Medicare coverage. Medicare reimbursement pricing approval for DetermaRx\u2122 did not become effective until September 2020. Deferrals in lung cancer surgeries due to COVID-19 may have reduced demand for DetermaRx\u2122, but because of the lack of historical DetermaRx\u2122 revenues, with or without Medicare reimbursement, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the deferral of those surgeries impacted our DetermaRx\u2122 revenues. Resurgences in COVID-19 cases could cause additional deferrals of lung cancer surgeries during the course of the pandemic. The lack of in-person interaction with healthcare providers for our promotion of the use of DetermaRx\u2122 has also placed a constraint on our ability to market that test, but we cannot determine the extent to which that has impacted our revenues due to the absence of historical revenues. Similarly, our Pharma Services revenues commenced with our acquisition of Insight during the first quarter of 2020 and because we do not have a prior history of Oncocyte marketed Pharma Services revenues it is difficult to assess how COVID-19 may have impacted those revenues, although we are aware that certain planned clinical trials of new pharmaceuticals for which we had expected to provide Pharma Services were delayed due to the pandemic.\nAlthough we have experienced limited COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions which to date did not impact our testing capacity, if the vendors of equipment and reagents used in our diagnostic laboratories experience supply, operational, or financial disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience supply constraints in the future that could cause increased costs or delays in performing DetermaRx\u2122 tests and Pharma Services and in continuing the development of new diagnostic tests, including DetermaIO\u2122.\nAdditionally, the anticipated economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact financial markets, resulting in high share price volatility, reduced market liquidity, and substantial declines in the market prices of the securities of some publicly traded companies. Volatile or declining markets for equities could adversely affect our ability to raise capital when needed through the sale of shares of common stock or other securities. Accordingly, we cannot assure that adequate financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are not able to raise the capital we need, we could be forced to modify, curtail, delay, or suspend some or all aspects of planned operations. Sales of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution of the interests of our shareholders.\nIt is possible that impacts of COVID-19 on Oncocyte\u2019s operations or revenues or its access to capital could prevent Oncocyte from complying, or could result in a material noncompliance, with one or more obligations or covenants under material agreements to which Oncocyte is a party, with the result that Oncocyte would be in material breach of the applicable obligation, covenant, or agreement. Any such material breach could cause Oncocyte to incur material financial liabilities or an acceleration of the date for paying a financial obligation to the other party to the applicable agreement, or could cause Oncocyte to lose material contractual rights, such as rights to use leased equipment or laboratory or office space, or rights to use licensed patents or other intellectual property the use of which is material to Oncocyte\u2019s business. Similarly, it is possible that impacts of COVID-19 on the business, operations, or financial condition of any third party with whom Oncocyte has a contractual relationship could cause the third party to be unable to perform its contractual obligations to Oncocyte, resulting in Oncocyte\u2019s loss of the benefits of a contract that could be material to Oncocyte\u2019s business.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses might impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we will not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; the development and spread of new strains, such as Delta and Omicron; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the difficulty or delay in clinical site initiation; the diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials; delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical trials; interruption of key clinical trial activities; interruption or delays in the operations of regulatory agencies, which may impact review and approval times; the availability and cost to access COVID-19 tests, vaccines and therapies; the effect on our potential customers and their demand for our diagnostic testing and Pharma Services; the effects on delays in development programs; and the effect on our suppliers and their ability to provide the necessary equipment and materials to support our tests and services and the general global supply chain disruptions that may have lasting impacts and consequences that are difficult to predict. In addition to the direct impacts to our business operations, the global economy is likely to continue to be significantly weakened as a result of actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the extent that such a weakened global economy impacts customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase and pay for our tests, our business and results of operation could be negatively impacted. Due to the uncertain scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertain timing of any recovery or normalization, we are currently unable to estimate the resulting impacts on our operations and financial results. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our operations, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, any customers and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and continues to affect our ability to conduct clinical trial activities, causing delays in clinical site initiations and patient screening and enrollment in our clinical trials, and may delay and disrupt regulatory activities and our manufacturing and supply chain and have other adverse effects on our business and operations.\nLike many other biopharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in clinical site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment in our clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of 2020, the pace of site opening and patient screening and enrollment was in line with our expectations. However, in the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began to rapidly affect clinical trial sites around the world. The delays continued throughout 2021 due to new variant surges in the US and EU where all of our trials are executed. Many of our clinical sites established self-imposed holds on site initiations and enrollment during this period out of concern for patient exposure to COVID-19 and due to lack of available staff. As a result, we experienced significant delays in site initiations, as well as patient screening and enrollment. During the summer of 2020, as the number of COVID-19 cases declined due to public health safety measures, some clinical sites removed their self-imposed holds on site initiations and enrollment, which improved the momentum of patient enrollment. However, beginning in November 2020, another steep rise in COVID-19 cases again negatively impacted the pace of enrollment. The emergence of COVID-19 variants also continued throughout 2021, causing further unpredictability and uncertainty about the pace at which patients and healthcare workers would be able to return to clinical sites.\nSince vaccine distribution has commenced in many countries, and we have begun to see the number of COVID-19 cases declining, we currently believe our clinical trial operations may normalize over the next several months. However, the pace at which any normalization may occur remains uncertain and unpredictable. Given the above factors, we expect there may continue to be delays in our clinical trials, in addition to delays and disruptions in regulatory activities as well as delays in manufacturing and supply chain that may continue to have adverse effects on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOwnership of our common stock will entail certain risks associated with the limited history of the trading of our common stock, volatility of prices for our shares, and the fact that we do not pay dividends.\nThe price of our stock may rise and fall rapidly.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of the shares of many biotechnology companies, may be highly volatile. The price of our common stock may rise or fall rapidly as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf Sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u25cf Results of or delays in preclinical testing or clinical trials of our diagnostic test candidates;\n\u25cf Announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, new diagnostic test introductions and commercial results;\n\u25cf The cost of our development programs;\n\u25cf The success of competitive diagnostic tests or technologies;\n\u25cf Litigation and other developments relating to our issued patents or patent applications or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf Conditions in the diagnostic, pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf Variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us, including the failure of our earnings to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf General economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u25cf Changes in payer coverage and or reimbursement.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have been experiencing extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the equity securities without regard to the operating performance of the issuing companies. Broad market fluctuations, as well as industry factors and general economic and political conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA FASB accounting standard could increase the risk that our future financial statements could be qualified by going concern uncertainty.\nUnder FASB accounting standard ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period our management must evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Oncocyte\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). As a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2014-15, we will be required to have more cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investments on hand on the date we issue or file our financial statements than had been the case during prior years in order to avoid going a concern qualification in our auditor\u2019s report and in the footnotes to our financial statements. If our financial statements were to become subject to a going concern qualification or uncertainty or if we are unable to alleviate substantial doubt as part of our going concern assessment, or both, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nBecause we do not pay dividends, our stock may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn dividend income.\nWe do not pay cash dividends on our common stock. For the foreseeable future we anticipate that any earnings generated in our business will be used to finance the growth of our business and will not be paid out as dividends to our shareholders. Under a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, we have agreed not to pay dividends or to make any distributions or to redeem or repurchase any capital stock without Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s prior written consent while the Loan and Security Agreement remains in effect. This means that our stock may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn income from their investments.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock, and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our shares.\nThe market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about our business and our common stock. We do not have any control over these analysts. Certain securities analysts cover our shares and they could issue reports or recommendations that are unfavorable to the price of our shares, and they could downgrade a previously favorable report or recommendation, and in either case our share price could decline as a result of the report. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our shares or fails to publish regular reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests if we issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 235,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 230,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 \u201cblank check\u201d shares of preferred stock. At December 31, 2021, there were 92,231,917 shares of common stock outstanding, 2,251,576 shares of common stock reserved for exercise of warrants and 11,601,589 shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options under our employee stock option plans. No shares of preferred stock are presently outstanding.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in order to raise additional capital, or in connection with hiring or retaining employees, directors, or consultants, or in connection with future acquisitions of licenses to technology or diagnostic tests in connection with future business acquisitions, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may also issue preferred stock having rights, preferences, and privileges senior to the rights of our common stock with respect to dividends, rights to share in distributions of our assets if we liquidate our company, or voting rights. Any preferred stock may also be convertible into common stock on terms that would be dilutive to holders of common stock.\nOur former parent company may sell its Oncocyte shares to raise capital to finance its operations.\nPrior to February 17, 2017, Oncocyte was a consolidated subsidiary of its former parent company Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc., formerly known as BioTime, Inc. (\u201cLineage\u201d). Based on its most recent report of beneficial ownership on Schedule 13D, as of January 8, 2021 Lineage held 3,297,401 shares of Oncocyte common stock. Lineage has been periodically selling shares of Oncocyte common stock from its holdings and has announced its intention to continue to sell Oncocyte shares. The sale of such shares could have a depressing effect on the market value of Oncocyte common stock and the prices at which we can sell our own shares of common stock to raise capital to support our operations.", "PERMNO": 15863, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "OCX"}
