RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces material risks, including credit, market and liquidity, operational, legal and regulatory and strategic and reputational risks. The factors described below are not intended to serve as a comprehensive listing of the risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we have not identified as material, or of which we currently are not aware, may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors occurs, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nCredit Risks\n\u2022Because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile, and we may need to make material provisions for credit losses in any period.\n\u2022Our allowance for credit losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors, and may not be adequate to absorb any actual credit losses.\n\u2022The borrowing needs of our clients have been and may continue to be unpredictable, especially during a challenging economic environment. We may not be able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses, which could have a material adverse effect.\nMarket and Liquidity Risks\n\u2022Our interest rate spread has and may continue to decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\u2022Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\n\u2022Our equity warrant assets, venture capital and private equity fund investments and direct equity investment portfolio gains depend upon the performance of our portfolio investments and the general condition of the public and private equity and M&A markets which are uncertain and may vary materially by period.\n\u2022Changes in the market for public equity offerings, M&A or a slowdown in private equity or venture capital investment levels may affect the needs of our clients for investment banking or M&A advisory services and lending products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022Our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022We face risks associated with the ability of our information technology systems and our people and processes to support our operations and future growth effectively.\n\u2022Business disruptions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control have in the past adversely affected our business, financial condition or results of operations and may do so in the future.\n\u2022We face risks from a prolonged work-from-home arrangement, as well as from our eventual implementation of a broader plan to return to the office or increase virtual working arrangements.\n\u2022We face risks from our interactions with business partners, service providers and other third parties.\n\u2022The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\n\u2022We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\n\u2022We face risks associated with our current international operations and ongoing international expansion.\n\u2022Our holding company, SVB Financial, relies on equity warrant assets income, investment distributions and dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its cash revenues.\n\u2022Climate change has the potential to disrupt our business and adversely impact the operations and creditworthiness of our clients.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\u2022We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, or result in higher costs to us, and the stringency of the regulatory framework applicable to us may increase if, and as, our balance sheet continues to grow.\n\u2022We expect to exceed $100 billion of average total consolidated assets (over four quarters) during 2021. We will therefore be subject to more stringent regulations, including certain enhanced prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies.\n\u2022We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act, other anti-money laundering and anti-bribery statutes and regulations, and U.S. economic and trade sanctions.\n\u2022If we were to violate, or fail to comply with, international, federal or state laws or regulations governing financial institutions, we could be subject to disciplinary action or litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\n\u2022Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims or fines against us.\n\u2022Adverse results from litigation or governmental or regulatory investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\n\u2022A failure to identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions and federal laws may prevent a merger or acquisition that may be attractive to stockholders and/or have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nStrategic, Reputational and other Risks\n\u2022Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses, while the establishment of limits to mitigate concentration risk increases the potential for lower revenues and slower growth.\n\u2022Decreases in the amount of equity capital available to our portfolio companies could adversely affect us.\n\u2022We face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, financial results, or growth.\n\u2022Our ability to maintain or increase our market share depends on our ability to attract and maintain, as well as meet the needs of, existing and future clients.\n\u2022We face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings and new business initiatives.\n\u2022Any damage to our reputation and relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022An ineffective risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our strategic planning and our ability to mitigate risks and/or losses and could have adverse regulatory consequences.\n\u2022We do not currently pay dividends on shares of our common stock and may not do so in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Acquisition of Boston Private\n\u2022We cannot ensure that the proposed Boston Private acquisition will be completed.\n\u2022We may fail to realize growth prospects and benefits anticipated as a result of the Boston Private acquisition.\nCredit Risks\nBecause of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile. We may need to make material provisions for credit losses in any period, which could reduce net income, increase net losses or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition in that period.\nOur loan portfolio has a credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. The credit profiles of our clients vary across our loan portfolio, based on the nature of our lending to different market segments.\nInvestor dependent loans. Many of our loans, particularly in our portfolios for early-stage and mid-stage privately held companies, are made to companies with modest or negative cash flows and/or no established record of profitable operations, primarily within the technology and life science and healthcare industries. Consequently, repayment of these loans is often dependent upon receipt by our borrowers of additional financing from venture capitalists or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party, public offering or other form of liquidity or \u201cexit\u201d event. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused certain client valuations to drop, reduced the rate of financing or other \u201cexit\u201d events, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on certain of our clients and their ability to repay their loans to us. Although these challenges have been somewhat offset by relief programs and decreased cash utilization, many of these companies may experience difficulties sustaining their businesses over time. There can be no assurance that these companies will be able to continue to obtain funding at current valuation levels, if at all and valuations may drop in a meaningful manner, which may impact the financial health of our client companies. For example, continued volatility in financial markets may make initial public offerings less attractive to investors seeking an \u201cexit\u201d event. In such case, investors may provide financing in a more selective manner, at lower levels and/or on less favorable terms, if at all, any of which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans to us.\nLarger loans; syndicated loans. In addition, a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of larger loans, which could increase the impact on us of any single borrower default. As of December 31, 2020, loans equal to or greater than $20 million to any single client (individually or in the aggregate) totaled $26.7 billion, or 59.0 percent of our portfolio. These larger loans have represented an increasing portion of our total loan portfolio over time. They include capital call lines of credit to our private equity and venture capital clients, as well as other loans made to our later-stage and larger corporate clients, and may be made to companies with greater levels of debt relative to their equity, balance sheet liquidity or cash flow. Additionally, we have continued our efforts to grow our loan portfolio by agenting or arranging larger syndicated credit facilities and participating in larger syndicates agented by other financial institutions as well as making sponsor-led buyout loans, which are leveraged buyout or recapitalization financings typically sponsored by our private equity clients. In those arrangements where we do not act as the lead syndicate agent, our control or decision-making ability over the credit facility is typically limited to our participation interest.\nLoans dependent on third parties. Further, the repayment of financing arrangements we enter into with our clients may be dependent on the financial condition or ability of third parties to meet their payment obligations to our clients. For example, we enter into formula-based financing arrangements that are secured by our clients\u2019 accounts receivable from third parties with whom they do business. We make loans secured by letters of credit issued by third party banks and enter into letters of credit discounting arrangements, the repayment of which may be dependent on reimbursement by third party banks. We extend recurring revenue-based lines of credit, where repayment may be dependent on borrowers\u2019 revenues from third parties. We also extend project financing to solar and other renewable energy providers, where repayment may be dependent on factors related to renewable energy generation, construction and access to take-out sources of financing, including tax credit equity. Further, in our loan portfolio of private equity and venture capital firm clients, many of our clients\nhave lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls or management fees by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. These capital call lines of credit are a significant portion of our loan portfolio. (Capital call lines of credit represent more than half of our loan portfolio as of the end of 2020, and may in future periods increase). These third parties may not be able to meet their financial obligations to our clients or to us, which, ultimately, could have an adverse impact on us.\nTechnology, life science and healthcare industries. In addition, because of the intense competition and rapid technological change that characterize the technology, life science and healthcare industry sectors in which most of our borrowers reside, as well as periodic volatility in the market prices for securities of companies in these industries, a borrower\u2019s financial position can deteriorate rapidly. Collateral for many of our loans often includes intellectual property and other intangible assets, which are difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case of default. As a result, even if a loan is secured, we may not be able to fully recover the amounts owed to us, if at all.\nWineries and vineyards. In addition, we lend to premium wineries and vineyards through SVB Wine. Repayment of loans made to these clients may be dependent on overall wine demand and sales, or other sources of financing or income which may be adversely affected by a challenging economic environment, as well as the value of underlying real estate and non-real estate collateral, overall grape supply and income from tourism which may be adversely affected by climate change, poor weather, heavy rains, flooding, droughts, fires, wildfires, earthquakes or other natural or catastrophic conditions. Our premium wine industry clients have been and may continue to be impacted by the loss of restaurant and winery sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impacts of the California wildfires in 2020.\nLoans to individuals. We also lend to individual investors, executives, entrepreneurs or other influencers in the innovation economy, primarily through SVB Private Bank, a division of the Bank. Our lending to individuals will substantially increase upon completion of our acquisition of Boston Private. These individual clients may face difficulties meeting their financial commitments, especially in a challenging economic environment, and may be unable to repay their loans, and these difficulties may be more acute if accompanied by a decline in real estate values. In certain instances, we may also relax loan covenants and conditions or extend loan terms to individual borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. While such determinations are based on an assessment of various factors, including access to additional capital in the near term, there can be no assurance that such continued support will result in any individual borrower meeting his or her financial commitments.\nBased on the credit profile of our overall loan portfolio, our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs and allowance for credit losses can be volatile and can vary materially from period to period. Increases in our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs or changes in economic forecasts may require us to increase our provision for credit losses in any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that period. For instance, during the first half of 2020, we significantly increased our allowance for credit losses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our borrowers. The continued effects of COVID-19 or other unforeseen events or future economic downturns or recessions may cause our clients to be unable to pay their loans as they come due or decrease the value of collateral, such as accounts receivable, which could cause us to materially increase our allowance for credit losses or incur credit losses in excess of the allowance in future periods. Additionally, such increases in our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs or changes in economic forecasts may also have an adverse effect on our capital ratios, credit ratings and market perceptions of us. See \u201cLoans\u201d under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Consolidated Financial Condition\u201d under Part II, Item 7 of this report.\nOur allowance for credit losses is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors, and may not be adequate to absorb credit losses.\nAs a lender, we face the risk that our borrower clients will fail to repay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause large aggregate losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We reserve for such losses by establishing an allowance for credit losses, the increase of which results in a charge to our earnings as a provision for credit losses. Although we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses that uses historical and other objective information reflective of the classification of loans, the establishment of credit losses are also dependent on macroeconomic forecasts as well as the subjective experience and judgment of our management. Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses stem from factors beyond our historical experience, as has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, or are otherwise inconsistent with our credit quality assessments. There can be no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to absorb future credit losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASU 2016-13\" or \"CECL\"), became effective January 1, 2020 and amended the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The standard removed the previous \u201cprobable\u201d threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial\nassets. Our ability to accurately forecast estimated credit losses depends on whether our credit loss model and related inputs correspond to actual loss rates.\nBanking regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we make in determining the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses. These regulators may conclude that changes are necessary, which could impact our overall credit portfolio. Such changes could result in, among other things, modifications to our methodology or models, reclassification or downgrades of our loans, increases in our allowance for credit losses or other credit costs, imposition of new or more stringent concentration limits, restrictions in our lending activities and/or recognition of further losses.\nThe borrowing needs of our clients have been and may continue to be unpredictable, especially during a challenging economic environment. We may not be able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as the conditions established under the agreement have been satisfied. The actual borrowing needs of our clients under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. As a result, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments reflected off our balance sheet, and a significant portion of these commitments ultimately expire without being drawn upon. See Note 21-\u201cOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments\u201d of the \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details. However, the actual borrowing needs of our clients may exceed our expected funding requirements. For example, our client companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments in a challenging economic environment due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit through other channels, or the limited availability of financings from private equity or venture capital firms, such as occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when certain clients increased utilization of credit lines to secure liquidity. In addition, limited partner investors of our private equity and venture capital fund clients may fail to meet their underlying investment commitments due to liquidity or other financing difficulties, which may impact our clients\u2019 borrowing needs. Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the actual borrowing needs of our clients may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nFurther, although we have established a reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, the level of the reserve is determined by a methodology that is similar to that used to establish our allowance for credit losses in our funded loan portfolio and that has also been amended by CECL. The reserve is susceptible to significant changes and is primarily based on credit commitments less the amounts that have been funded, the amount of the unfunded portion that we expect to be utilized in the future, credit quality of the loan credit commitments, and management\u2019s estimates and judgment. There can be no assurance that our allowance for unfunded credit commitments will be adequate to provide for actual losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. An increase in the allowance for unfunded credit commitments in any period may result in a charge to our earnings, which could reduce our net income or increase net losses in that period.\nMarket and Liquidity Risks\nOur interest rate spread has declined, and may continue to decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA significant portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and internal borrowings, and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to our clients, securities held in our investment portfolio and excess cash held to manage short-term liquidity. Our interest rate spread can be affected by the mix of loans, investment securities, deposits and other liabilities on our balance sheet, as well as a variety of external factors beyond our control that affect interest rate levels, such as competition, inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies of various governmental bodies. For example, changes in key variable market interest rates, such as the Federal Funds, National Prime (\u201cPrime\u201d), LIBOR or Treasury rates, generally impact our interest rate spread. While changes in interest rates do not generally produce equivalent changes in the revenues earned from our interest-earning assets and the expenses associated with our interest-bearing liabilities, increases in market interest rates are nevertheless likely to cause our interest rate spread to increase. Conversely, if interest rates decline, our interest rate spread will likely decline. In the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target Federal Funds rate to between zero and 0.25%, which contributed to the decline of our interest rate spread, and also led to a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities. If interest rates do not rise, or if the Federal Reserve lowers the target Federal Funds rate to below 0%, these low rates could continue to constrain our interest rate spread and may adversely affect our business forecasts. On the other hand, increases in interest rates may result in a change in the mix of non-interest and interest-bearing accounts, and the level of off-balance sheet market-based investment preferred by our clients, which may also impact our interest rate spread.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR or other reference rates, or uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the value of reference rate-linked debt securities that we hold or issue, which could further impact our interest rate spread. In 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer persuade or compel submission of bank rates used for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In 2020, the administrator of LIBOR announced that it will extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and will cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict what rate or rates may become broadly accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nRegulators, industry groups and certain committees (for example, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted in their current form, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the ultimate effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business, both at the SVB Financial and the Bank level. We require sufficient liquidity to meet our expected financial obligations, as well as unexpected requirements stemming from client activity and market changes, such as the unexpected cash outflows that occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic when certain clients increased utilization of their credit lines. Primary liquidity resources for SVB Financial include: cash flow from investments and interest in financial assets held by operating subsidiaries other than the Bank; to the extent declared, dividends from the Bank; and as needed, periodic capital market transactions offering debt and equity instruments in the public and private markets. The primary source of liquidity for the Bank is client deposits. When needed, our liquidity is supplemented by wholesale borrowing capacity in the form of short- and long-term borrowings secured by our portfolio of high-quality investment securities, long-term capital market debt issuances and unsecured overnight funding channels available to us in the Federal Funds market. An inability to maintain or raise funds through these sources could have a substantial negative effect, individually or collectively, on SVB Financial and the Bank\u2019s liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. For example, factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, a downturn in asset markets such that the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of our secured obligations, a reduction in our credit rating, any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business. Our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as laws and regulations that limit the amount of intercompany dividends that bank subsidiaries may pay, severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our competitive position, increase our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits, limit our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur equity warrant assets, venture capital and private equity fund investments and direct equity investment portfolio gains depend upon the performance of our portfolio investments and the general condition of the public and private equity and M&A markets, which have seen significant volatility in the past year, are uncertain and may vary materially by period.\nIn connection with negotiated credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in private, venture-backed companies primarily in the technology, life science and healthcare industries subject to applicable regulatory limits. We have also made investments through SVB Financial, SVB Leerink and our SVB Capital family of funds in venture capital funds and direct investments in companies, many of which are required to be carried at fair value or are impacted by changes in fair value. The fair values of these warrants and investments are reflected in our financial statements and are adjusted on a quarterly basis. Fair value changes are recorded as unrealized gains or losses through consolidated net income. However, the timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depends on factors beyond our control, including the perceived and actual performance of the companies or funds in which we invest, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the portfolio companies, the timing of our receipt of relevant financial information from these companies, market volatility and interest rate factors and legal and contractual restrictions. The value of these assets were impacted by the negative effects of the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though valuations and financial markets have rebounded since then, prolonged negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a further impact (potentially in a significant manner). Moreover, the timing and amount of our\nrealization of actual net proceeds, if any, from our disposition of these financial instruments also often depend on factors beyond our control. In addition to those mentioned above, such factors include the level of public offerings, and M&A or other exit activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell our equity positions (including the expiration of any \u201clock-up\u201d agreements) and the timing of any actual dispositions. Because of the inherent variability of these financial instruments and the markets in which they are bought and sold, their fair market value might increase or decrease materially from period to period, and the net proceeds ultimately realized upon disposition might be materially different than the then-current recorded fair market value.\nIn addition, depending on the fair value of these warrants and direct equity investments, a meaningful portion of the aggregate fair value of our total warrant and direct equity investment portfolios may, from time to time, be concentrated in a limited number of warrants and direct equity investments. Valuation changes in one or more of these warrants or direct equity investments may have a material impact on the valuation of our total investment portfolio. Moreover, because valuations of private companies are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value for private companies may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Therefore, fair value determinations may materially understate or overstate the value that we ultimately realize upon the sale of one or more investments. We cannot predict future realized or unrealized gains or losses, and any such gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period. See Note 15-\u201dDerivative Financial Instruments\u201d of the \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details.\nChanges in the market for public equity offerings, M&A or a slowdown in private equity or venture capital investment levels may affect the needs of our clients for investment banking or M&A advisory services and lending products, which could in turn adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWhile an active market for public equity offerings, financings, and M&A activity generally has positive implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering, are acquired by or merge with another entity or otherwise receive a significant equity investment.\nBy contrast, a low demand for public equity or M&A transactions or an inability to complete such transactions due to events affecting market conditions generally, could result in fewer transactions overall and therefore decrease revenues of SVB Leerink, our investment banking business, as such revenues stem primarily from underwriting and advisory fees associated with capital markets and M&A transactions. Although there was strong capital markets activity in the healthcare and life sciences sector in the second half of 2020, a decline in this activity in the future could lead to decreased revenues of SVB Leerink.\nA slowdown in overall private equity or venture capital investment levels may reduce the need for our clients to borrow from our capital call lines of credit, which are typically utilized by our private equity and venture capital fund clients to make investments prior to receipt of capital called from their respective limited partners. Any significant reduction in the outstanding amounts of our loans or under our lines of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOperational Risks\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. Although financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic, and global economic conditions showed signs of improvement in the second half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to contribute to, among other things (i) increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures; (ii) sudden and significant declines, and significant increases in volatility, in financial markets; (iii) ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries; (iv) increased utilization of credit lines as clients seek to bolster liquidity; (v) significant reductions in the targeted federal funds rate; and (vi) heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements and the current environment, including increased fraudulent activity. In addition, we also face an increased risk of client disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on market and economic conditions, actions that governmental authorities take in response to those conditions, and our implementation of and participation in special financial relief programs, such as the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") and U.K. Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (\"CBILS\"). Moreover, we have focused resources and management\nattention towards managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have and likely will have to continue to prioritize managing these impacts over certain growth initiatives and other investments in the near term.\nEarly-stage companies and certain industries (including the premium wine industry) where the Company has credit exposure, have experienced, and are expected to continue to experience, significant operational and financial challenges as a result of COVID-19. The effects of COVID-19 may also cause our clients to be unable to pay their loans as they come due or decrease the value of collateral, such as accounts receivable, which we expect would cause significant increases in our credit losses.\nWe remain unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. The extent of any continued or future adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and outside our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, the scope and duration of future phases or outbreaks, or seasonal or other resurgences, of the disease, and the effectiveness and implementation of vaccination efforts.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that could be committed against us, our clients or our third-party partners, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our employees or clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including credit fraud, check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering, business email compromise, ransomware, malfeasance and other dishonest acts. For example, in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 26, 2021, we disclosed that we became aware of a potentially fraudulent loan transaction, with possible credit exposure to us of up to $70 million, net of tax. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us, our clients or third-party partners, denial or degradation of service attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks. Sources of attacks vary and may include hackers, employees, vendors, business partners, organized crime, terrorists, foreign governments, corporate espionage and activists. Breaches may also be a result of human errors or mistakes unintentionally caused by us. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to experience heightened fraud and cybersecurity risks, as well as other information security risks, particularly as a result of work-from-home arrangements, which may be more susceptible to inadvertent human errors given the change in operating environment.\nConsistent with industry trends, we remain at risk for attempted electronic fraudulent activity, as well as attempts at security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents. Cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we increase our mobile, digital and internet-based product offerings and expand our internal use of internet-based products and applications, which we expect to remain elevated as long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Moreover, in recent periods, large corporations (including financial institutions and retail companies), as well as U.S. governmental agencies, have suffered significant data breaches or malware attacks, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us, which could subject us to potential liability. Additionally, state-sponsored or terrorist-sponsored efforts to hack or disable information technology systems increases risks, since the motivation may be for geopolitical as much as for financial gain.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on our networks and systems, as well as those of our clients and certain of our third-party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent cases have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees and third-party contractors. In addition, SVB provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with those merchants and/or with the payment networks. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach. Furthermore, SVB\u2019s cardholders use their debit and credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third-party processing services. As such, SVB is subject to risk from data breaches of such third party\u2019s information systems or its payment processors, for reasons including\nunauthorized card use. Such a data security breach could compromise SVB\u2019s account information, cause losses on card accounts and increase litigation costs. SVB may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security breaches, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts.\nWe also offer certain services that allow non-accountholders to process payments through SVB\u2019s systems, as well as financial analytics services. In the course of providing those services, we may obtain sensitive data about customers who do not otherwise hold accounts with us, including information regarding accounts held at other institutions, as well as profit and loss and other proprietary financial or other information regarding our customers or the non-accountholders they service. In the event of a data breach, this sensitive information may be exposed and could subject us to claims for damages.\nIn addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, ongoing work-from-home arrangements for our employees, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies and services (including cloud computing and storage, computing hardware, browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. The forms, methods and sophistication of fraud, security breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar criminal activity continue to evolve, and as we evolve and grow our business, especially in new business lines or geographic areas, we may be unable to foresee future risks. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security and effectiveness of our cyber incident response plans, our risk mitigation strategies and internal controls, including risk assessment policies and procedures, testing, backup and redundancy systems, incident response plans, training and authentication or encryption tools, may not be effective against defending against fraud, security breaches or cyber-attacks, and any insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur. Our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, fraudulent activities, breaches of security or cyber-attacks could result in: financial losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; loss or exposure of our confidential data or information; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; loss of personnel; disruption to our business; force majeure claims by us or critical suppliers; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nWe face risks associated with the ability of our information technology systems and our people and processes to support our operations and future growth effectively.\nOur information technology systems, people and internal business processes are critical to our operations and future growth, and were critical to our continued operations during the COVID-19 pandemic as we implemented work-from-home arrangements. Our systems may be subject to service outages from time to time due to various reasons, including infrastructure failures, interruptions due to system upgrades or malware removal, employee error or malfeasance, or other force majeure-related reasons (such as potential blackouts or brownouts in California), which could cause business disruption. Additionally, our systems and processes need to be sufficiently scalable to operate effectively, and we need to have the appropriate talent and organizational structures to support our business. Many of our systems and processes are interdependent and interconnected, meaning that a service outage or operational inefficiency with respect to one system or process could negatively impact other systems or processes. As a result, we continue to invest in technology and more automated solutions in order to optimize the efficiency of our core operational and administrative infrastructure. In the absence of having effective automated solutions, we may rely on manual processes which may be more prone to error. Moreover, as we evolve, we may further install or implement new systems and processes or otherwise replace, upgrade or make other modifications to our existing systems and processes. These changes could be costly and require significant investment in the training of our employees and other third-party partners, as well as impose substantial demands on management time. If we do not implement new initiatives or utilize new technologies effectively or in accordance with regulatory requirements, or if our people (including outsourced business partners) are not appropriately trained or developed or do not perform their functions properly or have the appropriate resources to do so, we could experience business interruptions or other system failures which, among other things, could result in inefficiencies, revenue losses, loss of clients, employee dissatisfaction, exposure to fraudulent activities, regulatory enforcement actions or damage to our reputation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBusiness disruptions and interruptions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control have in the past adversely affected our business, financial condition or results of operations and may do so in the future.\nOur operations can be subject to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control, such as the effects of earthquakes, fires, floods, severe weather, public health issues such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus or other pandemic diseases, power failures, telecommunication loss, major accidents, terrorist attacks, acts of war, political, economic and social unrest, and other natural and man-made events, some of which may be intensified by the effects of climate change and changing weather patterns. For example, our corporate headquarters and some of our critical business offices are located in California, which has recently experienced major wildfires and blackouts and is located over major earthquake fault lines. We also maintain critical business facilities in Texas, which has recently experienced severe weather conditions, major blackouts and water service disruptions. Furthermore, climate change, the increasing frequency or severity of weather events, an earthquake or other disaster could cause severe destruction, disruption or interruption to our operations or property and significantly impact our employees and could damage, destroy or otherwise reduce the value of collateral, which could materially increase our credit losses. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has had direct effects on our operations, including by limiting employee travel and increasing telecommuting arrangements. We may experience negative effects of prolonged work-from-home arrangements, such as increased risks of systems access or connectivity issues, cybersecurity or information security breaches, and challenges our employees may face in maintaining a balance between work and home life, which may lead to reduced productivity and/or significant disruptions in our business operations.\nWe and other financial institutions generally must resume operations promptly following any interruption. If we were to suffer a disruption or interruption and were not able to resume normal operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner. In addition, depending on the nature and duration of the disruption or interruption, we might become vulnerable to fraud, additional expense or other losses, or to a loss of business and clients. Although we have implemented a business continuity management program that we continue to enhance on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that the program will adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.\nAdditionally, natural disasters and external events, including but not limited to those that have occurred and may occur in and around California, have affected, and could in the future affect, the business and operations of our clients, which could impair their ability to repay their loans or fees when due, impair the value of collateral securing their loans, cause our clients to reduce their deposits with us, or otherwise adversely affect their business dealings with us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A significant portion of our client borrowers, including our premium winery and vineyard clients, our SVB Private Bank mortgage clients and other corporate clients, are located in or have offices in California, which has historically experienced severe natural disasters resulting in disruptions to businesses and damage to property, including wildfires and earthquakes. If there is a major earthquake, flood, fire, drought or other natural or catastrophic disaster in California or elsewhere in the markets in which we operate, our borrowers may experience uninsured property losses or sustained disruption to business or loss that may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations.\nWe face risks from a prolonged work-from-home arrangement, as well as from our eventual implementation of a broader plan to return to the office or increase virtual working arrangements.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, we have moved to a work-from-home plan, restricted business travel, postponed or moved to online SVB-hosted events, and enabled remote access to our systems. Although our work-from-home plan has been effective thus far, we may experience negative effects of a prolonged work-from-home arrangement, such as increasing risks of systems access or connectivity issues, cybersecurity or information security breaches, reduced team collaboration, or imbalances between work and home life, which may lead to reduced productivity and/or significant disruptions in our business operations.\nMoreover, we are developing a plan for employees to eventually return to work in our offices, the manner and timing of which are still to be finalized. Our return to office plan will be subject to a variety of complex considerations including, among others, international, federal, state and local government laws, regulations and guidance, health organization guidance, health and safety implications (including the availability of vaccinations and potential health testing requirements), employee needs, and the practical requirements of potential office reconfigurations or a phased return. We may also expand our work model to increase virtual or remote working arrangements, and if implemented ineffectively, may also result in reduced productivity and/or significant disruptions in our business operations.\nWe face reputation and business risks due to our interactions with business partners, service providers and other third parties.\nAs a financial service institution with domestic and international operations, we rely on third parties, both in the United States and internationally in countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Denmark, Hong Kong, China, Israel and India, to provide services to us and our clients or otherwise act as partners in our business activities in a variety of ways, including through the provision of key components of our business infrastructure. We expect these third parties to\nperform services for us, fulfill their obligations to us, accurately inform us of relevant information, and conduct their activities in a manner that reflects positively on our brand and business. Although we manage exposure to such third-party risk through a variety of means, including the performance of due diligence and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance, there can be no assurance these efforts will be effective. Any failure of our business partners, service providers or other third parties to meet their commitments to us or to perform in accordance with our expectations could result in operational disruptions, increased expenditures, regulatory actions in which we may be held responsible for the actions of third parties, damage to our reputation and the loss of clients, which in turn could harm our business and operations, strategic growth objectives and financial performance. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our counterparties and third-party service providers have been, and may further be, affected by \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, market volatility and other factors that increase their risk of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services.\nOur third-party partners may also rely on their own business partners and service providers in the ordinary course of their business. Although we seek to diversify our exposure to third-party partners in order to increase our resiliency, we are nevertheless exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us, which in turn could harm our business and operations, strategic growth objectives and financial performance.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, payment processors and other institutional clients, which may result in payment obligations to us or to our clients due to products we have arranged. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and market risk that may cause our counterparty or client to default. In particular, the interconnectivity of multiple financial services institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Any losses arising from such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other information relating to their business or financial condition. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports or other certifications of their auditors or accountants. For example, under our accounts receivable financing arrangements, we rely on information, such as invoices, contracts and other supporting documentation, provided by our clients and their account debtors to determine the amount of credit to extend. Similarly, in deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers\u2019 representations that their financial statements conform to GAAP (or other applicable accounting standards in foreign markets) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. If we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information in evaluating the creditworthiness or other risk profiles of our clients or counterparties, we could be subject to credit losses, regulatory action, reputational harm or experience other adverse effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with our current international operations and ongoing international expansion.\nOne important component of our strategy is to expand internationally. We currently have international offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel, Germany, Denmark, India, Hong Kong and China, including a joint-venture bank in China. We have expanded and plan to continue to expand our operations and business activities in some of our current international markets. For example, we have expanded our presence in India, where we currently conduct certain technology and finance operations. We also plan to expand our business beyond our current markets over time. Our efforts to expand our business internationally carry certain risks, including risks arising from the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations; risks associated with leveraging and doing business with local business partners through joint ventures, strategic arrangements or other partnerships; and other general operational risks. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis, including, among others, legal, regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions; uncertainties regarding liability, tariffs and other trade barriers, such as recent trade tensions between the United States and China; uncertainties regarding international public health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; the incremental requirement of management\u2019s attention and resources; differing technology standards or customer requirements; data security or transfer risks; cultural differences; political and economic risks such as uncertainty created by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union; and financial risks, including currency\nand payment risks such as fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies, such as the euro. These risks could hinder our ability, or the ability of our local partners, to service our clients effectively, and adversely affect the success of our international operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we face risks that our employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act, GDPR, anti-corruption laws, privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, economic and trade sanctions requirements and other applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could, among other things, result in enforcement actions and fines against us, as well as limitations on the conduct of our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur holding company, SVB Financial, relies on equity warrant assets income, investment distributions, periodic capital market transactions and dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its cash revenues.\nSVB Financial is a holding company and is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives most of its cash revenues from a few primary funding sources: income from equity warrant assets and investment securities, from periodic capital markets transactions offering debt and equity instruments in the public and private markets, and, to the extent declared, cash dividends paid by subsidiaries, primarily the Bank. These sources generate cash which is used by SVB Financial to pay operating and borrowing costs and, to the extent authorized or declared, fund dividends to holders of its capital stock and stock repurchase programs. Any income derived from those financial instruments is subject to a variety of factors as discussed in the \u201cCredit Risks\u201d portion of this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Moreover, various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to SVB Financial. In addition, SVB Financial\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a liquidation or reorganization of any of its subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nClimate change has the potential to disrupt our business and adversely impact the operations and creditworthiness of our clients.\nClimate change has caused severe weather patterns and events that could disrupt operations at one or more of our locations, which may disrupt our ability to provide financial products and services to our clients. Climate change could also have a negative effect on the financial status and creditworthiness of our clients, such as those in the wine industry, which may decrease revenues and business activities from those clients, increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to such clients, and decrease the value of our warrants and direct equity investments in such clients, if any.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, or result in higher costs to us, and the stringency of the regulatory framework applicable to us may increase if, and as, our balance sheet continues to grow.\nSVB Financial, including the Bank, is extensively regulated under federal and state laws and regulations governing financial institutions, including those imposed by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, the SEC, and the DFPI, as well as various regulatory authorities that govern our global activities. Federal and state laws and regulations govern, restrict, limit or otherwise affect the activities in which we may engage and may affect our ability to expand our business over time, result in an increase in our compliance costs, including higher FDIC insurance premiums, and may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees (especially when compared to competitors not subject to similar restrictions). Further, the stringency of the regulatory framework that applies to us may increase as our asset size and international business grows.\nA change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including the possibility of legislative regulatory and policy changes by the new Congress and Biden-Harris Administration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including limiting or imposing conditions on the types of financial services and products we may offer or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. Increased regulatory requirements (and the associated compliance costs), whether due to the growth of our business, the adoption of new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations, or more expansive or aggressive enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, personnel at the U.S. banking agencies that regulate us may soon change given the change in presidential administration. New personnel may take new or different positions than their predecessors and that could result in additional regulatory requirements or requirements to change certain practices.\nWe expect to exceed $100 billion of average total consolidated assets (over four quarters) during 2021. We will therefore be subject to more stringent regulations, including certain enhanced prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies.\nCertain enhanced prudential standards and related requirements will apply to us when we exceed $100 billion in average total consolidated assets calculated over four consecutive financial quarters, which we expect to happen in 2021. Category IV institutions under the Tailoring Rules (which we expect to be) are subject to additional requirements, such as certain enhanced prudential standards and monitoring and reporting certain risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms are, among other things, subject to (1) supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial basis, (2) requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and (3) certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements, including liquidity buffer and liquidity stress testing requirements. When we become subject to enhanced prudential standards, we will face more stringent requirements or limitations on our business, as well as increased compliance costs, and, depending on our levels of capital and liquidity, stress test results and other factors, we may be limited in the types of activities we may conduct and be limited as to how we utilize our capital, including with respect to common stock repurchases. Further, we may be subject to heightened expectations, which could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, higher penalties, and more severe consequences if we are unable to meet those expectations. See \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Enhanced Prudential Standards,\u201d under this Part I, Item 1, for a more detailed description of the various requirements that may become applicable to us.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act, other anti-money laundering and anti-bribery statutes and regulations, and U.S. economic and trade sanctions.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions to, among other duties, institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with state and federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice and IRS. We also must comply with U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we, like other financial institutions, are subject to increased scrutiny for compliance with these requirements. We maintain policies, procedures and systems designed to detect and deter prohibited financing activities. However, if these controls were deemed deficient or fail to prevent wrongdoing, we could be subject to liability, including civil fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan. In addition, any failure to effectively maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we were to violate, or fail to comply with, international, federal or state laws or regulations governing financial institutions, we could be subject to disciplinary action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nInternational, federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to financial institutions. Other regulatory bodies, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, regulate investment advisers and broker-dealers, including our subsidiaries, SVB Asset Management, SVB Wealth Advisory, and SVB Leerink, as well as the registered investment advisers we will acquire upon closing the Boston Private acquisition. These laws and regulations are highly complex, and if we were to violate, even if unintentionally or inadvertently, regulatory authorities could take various actions against us, such as imposing restrictions on how we conduct our business, imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements, requiring us to maintain higher insurance levels, revoking necessary licenses or authorizations, imposing censures, significant civil money penalties or fines, issuing cease and desist or other supervisory orders, and suspending or expelling us or any of our employees from certain businesses. For example, we could face material restrictions on our activities and our ability to enter into certain transactions if SVB Financial and the Bank cease to maintain their status as well-capitalized or well-managed as defined under relevant regulations. These enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nLaws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims or fines against us.\nWe are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and non-U.S. laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy and security, including the protection of personal information. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, the GDPR extends the scope of the European Union data protection law to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of location, while the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") established new requirements regarding handling of personal data to entities serving or employing California residents, and such requirements will be expanded under the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\") once it goes into effect on January 1, 2023. The GDPR, CCPA and CPRA have heightened our privacy compliance obligations and have required us to evaluate our current operations, information technology systems and data handling practices and implement changes where necessary to comply, with associated costs. Our failure to comply with any such laws, or the failure of our current operations, information technology systems and data handling practices to prevent breaches involving personal data, may result in significant liabilities and/or reputational harm. See \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Privacy and Cybersecurity,\u201d under this Part I, Item 1, for a more detailed description of the various consumer privacy laws that are applicable to us.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental or regulatory investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.\nWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and may from time to time be involved in governmental or regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of our business. While we have not recognized a material accrual liability for any lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date, the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the actual results of one or more of such matters may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved, or that judgments may be rendered, or fines or penalties assessed in matters for which we have no reserves. Further, adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations may result in significant monetary damages, admissions of guilt or injunctive relief that may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they are presently being conducted. Any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation and overlapping government investigations, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects. These matters also include responding to governmental inquiries regarding our customers. In recent years across the financial services industry, a number of investigations of customers have, based on the circumstances, led to investigations of the particular bank and its policies.\nMoreover, even if we prevail in such actions, litigation and investigations can cause reputational harm and be costly and time-consuming, and often risk diverting the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.\nDue to the broad scope of our businesses, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non-public information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship. For example, SVB Leerink provides investment banking services to clients in the healthcare and life sciences industry, some of which may also be clients or potential clients of the Bank. In addition, we invest in and partner with entities in the innovation economy, some of which may be clients or potential clients of the Bank. These types of potential conflicts are expected to increase with our acquisition of Boston Private and the related expansion in our private bank business.\nWe have procedures and controls designed to identify and address these conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nAnti-takeover provisions and federal laws, particularly those applicable to financial institutions, may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could prevent a merger or acquisition that may be attractive to stockholders and/or have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to certain laws that could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal and state regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, either the Federal Reserve must approve or, after receiving notice, must not object to any person or entity acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d (as determined under the Federal Reserve\u2019s standards) of a bank holding company, such as SVB Financial, or a state member bank, such as the Bank. In addition, DFPI approval may be required in connection with the acquisition of control of the Bank. Moreover, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and certain other actions we may take or have taken could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. Any of these laws, regulations and other provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nStrategic, Reputational and Other Risks\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses, while the establishment of limits to mitigate concentration risk increases the potential for lower revenues and slower growth.\nOur focus on certain markets or segments, including those by client industry, life-cycle stage, size and geography, increases the potential for significant losses due to concentration of risk. It may also result in lower revenues or slower growth if we choose to limit growth in certain markets or segments to mitigate concentration risk. While there may exist a great deal of diversity within each industry, our clients are concentrated within the following general industries: technology, life science and healthcare, private equity and venture capital and premium wine. Clients of our private banking division are primarily professionals in these industries, though this will change upon closing of the acquisition of Boston Private. In particular, our technology clients generally tend to be in the industries of hardware (such as semiconductors, communications, data storage and electronics), software/internet (such as infrastructure software, applications, software services, digital content and advertising technology), and energy and resource innovation. Our life science and healthcare clients are concentrated in the industries of biotechnology, medical devices, healthcare information technology and healthcare services. Many of our client companies are also concentrated by certain stages within their life cycles, such as early-stage, mid-stage or later-stage and many of these companies are venture capital-backed. In addition, growth prospects and our geographic focus on key domestic and international innovation markets, as well as premium wine markets, may lead to an increase in our concentration risk. Our loan concentrations are derived from our borrowers engaging in similar activities as well as certain types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could cause those borrowers to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. Any adverse effect on any of our areas of concentration could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable to our competitors that are not exposed to similar concentration risk.\nDecreases in the amount of equity capital available to our portfolio companies could adversely affect our business, growth and profitability.\nOur core strategy is focused on providing banking and financial products and services to companies, investors, entrepreneurs and influencers in the innovation economy, including in particular to early-stage and mid-stage companies that receive financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capital or private equity firms, \u201cangels,\u201d corporate investors, crowd-funding and other evolving sources of capital. We derive a meaningful share of our deposits from these companies and provide them with loans as well as other banking products and services. In some cases, our lending credit decision is based on our analysis of the likelihood that our client will receive additional rounds of equity capital from investors or other funding sources. Among the factors that have affected and could in the future affect the amount of capital available to our portfolio companies are: the receptivity of the capital markets; the prevalence of public equity offerings or M&A activity (primarily among companies within the technology and life science and healthcare industry sectors); the availability and return on alternative investments; economic conditions in the technology, life science and healthcare and private equity/venture capital industries; and overall general economic conditions. Reduced capital markets valuations could also reduce the amount of capital available to our client companies, including companies within our technology and life science and healthcare industry sectors. If the amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the number of our new clients and investor financial support to our existing clients could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth prospects.\nWe face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or growth.\nWe compete with other banks as well as specialty and diversified financial services companies and investment, debt, venture capital and private equity funds, some of which are larger than we are and which may offer a broader range of lending, leasing, payments, foreign currency exchange, and other financial products and advisory services to our client base. We also compete with other alternative and more specialized lenders, such as online \u201cmarketplace\u201d lenders, peer-to-peer lenders and other non-traditional lenders that have emerged in recent years.\nMoreover, we compete with fintech and non-financial services companies, many of which offer bank or bank-like products, specialized services involving the elimination of banks as intermediaries (known as \u201cdisintermediation\u201d) and/or the unbundling of banking products and services into point solutions. The activity of fintechs and support of fintechs by venture capital firms has increased significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to increase. For example, a number of fintechs have applied for, and in some cases received, bank or industrial loan charters or have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. There has also been significant fintech activity in the areas of credit cards, payments, foreign exchange and lending. Regulatory changes, such as the December 2020 revisions to the FDIC\u2019s rules on brokered deposits, may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products. In addition, some traditional technology companies are beginning to provide financial services directly to their customers and are\nexpected to continue to explore new ways to do so. Many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints than we do, and some have lower cost structures. Some of these companies also have greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we currently have and may be able to better recruit technology talent.\nOur competitors may focus their marketing efforts on industry sectors that we serve; for example, they may seek to increase their lending and other financial relationships with technology companies or special industries such as wineries. When new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share or ability to exploit new market opportunities. We may have to agree to accept less attractive credit, pricing and other investment terms if we act to meet these competitive challenges, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth. Similarly, competitive pressures and market disruption could adversely affect our access to capital and attractive investment opportunities for our funds business.\nOur ability to maintain or increase our market share depends on our ability to attract and maintain, as well as meet the needs of, existing and future clients.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain or increase our market share. In particular, much of our success depends on our ability to attract early-stage or start-up companies as clients and to retain those companies as clients as they grow and mature successfully through the various stages of their life cycles. As a result, we adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards as well as introduce new products and services beyond industry standards in order to serve our clients, who are innovators themselves. A failure to achieve market acceptance for any new products or services we introduce, a failure to introduce products or services that the market demands, or the costs associated with developing, introducing and providing new products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, growth prospects and financial condition.\nWe face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings and new business initiatives.\nWe are engaged, and may in the future engage, in strategic activities domestically or internationally (including acquisitions such as the pending acquisition of Boston Private and the recently completed acquisition of WestRiver Group's (\"WRG\") debt fund business), joint ventures, partnerships, investments or other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful.\nWe are focused on our long-term growth and have undertaken various strategic activities and business initiatives, many of which involve activities that are new to us or, in some cases, are experimental in nature. For example, we are expanding our global presence and may engage in activities in jurisdictions where we have limited experience from a business, legal and/or regulatory perspective. With the acquisition of SVB Leerink, we have also expanded into new lines of business, namely, investment banking and M&A advisory services. In January 2021, we announced our pending acquisition of Boston Private, which will significantly expand our wealth management and private banking business and introduce new lines of lending and new deposit products, new types of customers and a number of bank branches. We are also expanding our payments processing capabilities to better serve our clients, including innovating new electronic payment processing solutions, developing new payments technologies, and supporting new or evolving disruptive payments systems, and, with the pending acquisition of Boston Private, expect to expand our private bank and wealth management services. We may also serve clients that deal with new or evolving industries or business activities, such as digital currencies and cannabis. Given our evolving geographic and product diversification, and our innovative product solutions, these initiatives may subject us to, among other risks, increased business, reputational and operational risk, as well as more complex legal, regulatory and compliance costs and risks.\nOur ability to execute strategic activities and new business initiatives successfully (such as the acquisition of SVB Leerink and the pending acquisition of Boston Private) will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may include our success in integrating an acquired company or a new internally developed growth initiative into our business, operations, services, products, personnel and systems, operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business, meeting applicable regulatory requirements and obtaining applicable regulatory licenses or other approvals, hiring or retaining key employees, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting management\u2019s expectations, realizing the anticipated benefits of the activities, and overall general market conditions. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential liability. If we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation or growth prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, in order to finance future strategic undertakings, we might require additional financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If obtained, equity financing could be dilutive and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business reputation and relationships are important and any damage to them could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur reputation is very important in sustaining our business and we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential clients and stockholders, the venture capital and private equity communities, and other actors in the industries that we serve. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, the way in which we conduct our business (including with respect to the administration of PPP or our actions related to environmental, social and governance matters) or otherwise, could strain our existing relationships and make it difficult for us to develop new relationships. Additionally, negative publicity regarding the industries that we focus on serving (for example, technology, private equity or venture capital) may also damage our reputation. Any such damage to our reputation and relationships could in turn lead to a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to our reputation. In addition, the behavior of our employees, including with respect to our employees\u2019 use of social media, subjects us to potential negative publicity if such behavior does not align with our high standards of integrity or fails to comply with regulations or accepted practices.\nAn ineffective risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our strategic planning and our ability to mitigate risks and/or losses and could have adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe have implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage our risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, operational, capital, compliance, strategic and reputational risks. Our framework also includes financial, analytical, forecasting or other modeling methodologies, which involve management assumptions and judgment. In addition, our Board of Directors, in consultation with management, has adopted a risk appetite statement, which sets forth certain thresholds and limits to govern our overall risk profile. However, there is no assurance that our risk management framework, including the risk metrics under our risk appetite statement, will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately identify, manage or mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and become subject to regulatory consequences, as a result of which our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not currently pay dividends on shares of our common stock and may not do so in the future.\nHolders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and have no current plans to do so. Furthermore, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of our capital stock, including our common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such junior stock, unless we have declared and paid full dividends on our outstanding preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period. We are also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock. If we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason, we may be limited in our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Pending Acquisition of Boston Private\nWe cannot ensure that the proposed Boston Private acquisition will be completed.\nWe cannot ensure that the proposed Boston Private acquisition will be completed. There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the Boston Private acquisition. For example, the Boston Private acquisition may not be completed, or may not be completed in the timeframe, on the terms or in the manner currently anticipated, as a result of a number of factors, including, among other things, the failure of one or more of the conditions to closing. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Boston Private acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the Boston Private acquisition. The Boston Private merger agreement may be terminated by the parties thereto under certain circumstances. Any delay in closing or a failure to close could have a negative impact on our business and the trading price of our securities.\nIn addition, to complete the Boston Private acquisition, we need to obtain approvals or consents from, and make filings with, certain applicable governmental authorities, which include the Federal Reserve, the DFPI and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. While we believe that we will receive all required approvals for the Boston Private acquisition, there can be no assurance as to the receipt or timing of receipt of these approvals. The receipt of such approvals may be conditional upon actions that we are not obligated to take under the Boston Private merger agreement, which could result in the termination of the Boston Private merger agreement by us, or, if such approvals are received, their terms could have a detrimental impact on us following the completion of the Boston Private acquisition. A substantial delay in obtaining any required authorizations, approvals or consents, or the imposition of unfavorable terms, conditions or restrictions contained in such authorizations, approvals or consents, could prevent the completion of the Boston Private acquisition or have an adverse effect on the anticipated benefits of the Boston Private acquisition, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize the growth prospects and other benefits anticipated as a result of the Boston Private acquisition.\nThe success of the Boston Private acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from the Boston Private acquisition. We may never realize these business opportunities and growth prospects. The Boston Private acquisition and related integration will require significant efforts and expenditures. Our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures and the cost of integration may exceed our expectations. We currently expect to incur approximately $200 million of restructuring costs in connection with the transaction and to take an additional write-down on Boston Private\u2019s loan portfolio at closing. We may also be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, improve or sustain the acquired operations or take write-offs or impairment charges and may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the Boston Private acquisition. In addition, the success of the Boston Private acquisition will depend in part on our ability to retain Boston Private\u2019s employees and clients. If we are unable, for any reason, to retain key employees or clients, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nIf any of these factors limit our ability to complete the Boston Private acquisition and integration of operations successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations of future results of operations following the Boston Private acquisition might not be met. In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, information technology systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Boston Private acquisition and could harm our financial performance.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we fail to retain key employees or recruit new employees, or if we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our employee base, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on key personnel, including a substantial number of employees who have technical expertise in their subject matter area and a strong network of relationships with individuals and institutions in the markets we serve. In addition, as we expand into international markets, we will need to hire local personnel within those markets. Further, competition for key personnel is substantial and may increase, particularly if new competitors seek to enter one of our markets or existing market participants seek to increase their market share. If we were to have less success in recruiting and retaining these employees than our competitors, for reasons including domestic or foreign regulatory restrictions on compensation practices, inability to effectively address issues related to human capital management, or the availability of more attractive opportunities elsewhere, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we have experienced meaningful growth in our employee base in recent years. The number of our full-time equivalent employees increased from 3,564 at December 31, 2019 to 4,461 at December 31, 2020, and is expected to continue to increase through our organic growth, as well as through potential acquisitions, such as our pending acquisition of Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. If this growth places strain on our operations, corporate culture or human capital management practices, or if we are unable to adequately integrate new employees or to maintain employee satisfaction, our growth and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, equity awards are an important component of our compensation program, especially for our executive officers and other members of senior management. The extent of shares available for grant in connection with such equity awards pursuant to our incentive compensation plans is generally subject to stockholder approval. If we do not have sufficient shares to grant to existing or new employees, there could be an adverse effect on our recruiting and retention efforts, which could impact our growth and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential holders of our securities could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our securities.\nMaintaining and adapting our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations of the SEC, can be costly and require significant management attention. As we continue to grow or acquire additional businesses, our internal controls may become more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amidst dynamic regulatory and other guidance. Failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in the process may harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or if we are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement costly and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions, including the potential delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Stock Market. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as the trading price of our securities, and could potentially subject us to litigation.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the FASB or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Also, our global initiatives, as well as continuing trends towards the convergence of international accounting standards, such as rules that may be adopted under the International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d), may result in our Company being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or external auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition or results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our revising or restating prior period financial statements.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations.\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its constituent states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have business operations. These tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. Changes to the tax laws, including as a result of the changes in the U.S. presidential administration and the U.S. Congress, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our net income.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.\nQuantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating credit losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, and managing risk. However, all models have certain limitations. For example, our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect the changing environment. Further, even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model\u2019s design. Although we employ strategies to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models, they may not be effective or fully reliable. As a result, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we operate and ultimately cause planning failures or the reporting of incorrect information to our regulators. Any such occurrence or the perception of such occurrence by our regulators, investors or clients could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nThe price of our capital stock may be volatile or may decline.\nThe trading price of our capital stock may fluctuate or be adversely affected as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, including trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. Factors that could affect the trading price of our capital stock include:\n\u2022actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022actions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in interest rates;\n\u2022market perceptions about the innovation economy, including levels of funding or \u201cexit\u201d activities of companies in the industries we serve;\n\u2022proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; and\n\u2022domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock and the value of our other securities will further depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, and future sales of our equity or equity-related securities. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on trading prices of capital stock and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. A significant decline in the trading price of our capital stock could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation, as well as the loss of key employees.\nOur capital stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nOur capital stock, including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock, ranks junior to all of SVB Financial\u2019s existing and future indebtedness and other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future to increase our capital resources or if our total capital ratio or the total capital ratio of the Bank falls below the required minimums. Furthermore, our common stock is subordinate to our outstanding preferred stock.", "PERMNO": 11786, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SIVB"}
