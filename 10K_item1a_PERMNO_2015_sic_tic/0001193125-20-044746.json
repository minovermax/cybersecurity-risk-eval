Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Report. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. As a result, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns that may negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for the end-user products in which they are used) and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, these and other factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular. Periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. We have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged, downturns in the future as a result of such cyclical changes. This may reduce our results of operations.\nWe base our planned operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenue, and a significant portion of our expenses is relatively fixed in the short term. If revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect, we likely will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter, which would harm our operating results for that quarter.\nOur restructuring activities and dispositions of assets and businesses could result in lost business and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may choose to sell assets, restructure business operations, shut down manufacturing lines or otherwise dispose of assets and businesses as part of management\u2019s strategies to better align our product offerings with market demands and our customers\u2019 needs. In connection with these activities, we face risks that we will disrupt service to our customers, lose business and incur significant costs related to such activities. These risks include potential damage to our reputation and customer relationships if we are unable to effectively transition such customer relationships to other production lines or products or if we cannot effectively manage our supplier and vendor relationships during such activities. In addition, we may also face claims or costs associated with transitioning or eliminating certain employee positions and modifying or terminating vendor relationships in connection with those exit activities.\nIf we fail to develop new products and process technologies or enhance our existing products and services in order to react to rapid technological change and market demands, our business will suffer.\nOur industry is subject to constant and rapid technological change and product obsolescence as customers and competitors create new and innovative products and technologies. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, and we may not be able to access advanced process technologies, including smaller geometries, or to license or otherwise obtain essential intellectual property required by our customers.\nWe must develop new products and services and enhance our existing products and services to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements. We design products for customers that continually require higher performance and functionality at lower costs. We must, therefore, continue to enhance the performance and functionality of our products. The development process for these advancements is lengthy and requires us to accurately anticipate technological changes and market trends. Developing and enhancing these products is uncertain and can be time-consuming, costly and complex. If we do not continue to develop and maintain process technologies that are in demand by our Foundry Services Group customers, we may be unable to maintain existing customers or attract new customers.\nCustomer and market requirements can change during the development process. There is a risk that these developments and enhancements will be late, fail to meet customer or market specifications or not be competitive with products or services from our competitors that offer comparable or superior performance and functionality. Any new products, such as our expanding line of power management solutions, or product or service enhancements, may not be accepted in new or existing markets. Our business will suffer if we fail to develop and introduce new products and services or product and service enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nWe manufacture our products based on our estimates of customer demand, and if our estimates are incorrect, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer demand and expected demand for and success of their products. The short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to estimate accurately future customer demand for our products. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in supply, which can challenge our production resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers\u2019 increased demand for our products. Conversely, downturns in the semiconductor industry have caused and may in the future cause our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products they order from us. Because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand would decrease our results of operations, including our gross profit.\nOur customers may cancel their orders, reduce quantities or delay production, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations.\nWe generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers may cancel their orders, reduce quantities or delay production for a number of reasons. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers, which we have experienced as a result of periodic downturns in the semiconductor industry, or failure to achieve design-wins, have affected and may continue to affect our results of operations adversely. These risks are exacerbated because many of our products are customized, which hampers our ability to sell excess inventory to the general market. We may incur charges resulting from the write-off of obsolete inventory. In addition, while we do not obtain long-term purchase commitments, we generally agree to the pricing of a particular product over a set period of time. If we underestimate our costs when determining pricing, our margins and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on high utilization of our manufacturing capacity, a reduction of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the results of our operations.\nAn important factor in our success is the extent to which we are able to utilize the available capacity in our fabrication facilities. As many of our costs are fixed, a reduction in capacity utilization, as well as changes in other factors, such as reduced yield or unfavorable product mix, could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our operating results. A number of factors and circumstances may reduce utilization rates, including periods of industry overcapacity, low levels of customer orders, operating inefficiencies, strategic evaluations and decisions by our Board related our overall business, divisions and business lines, mechanical failures and disruption of operations due to expansion or relocation of operations, power interruptions and fire, flood or other natural disasters or calamities. The potential delays and costs resulting from these factors and circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales comes from a relatively limited number of customers, the loss of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nHistorically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. If we were to lose key customers or if customers cease to place orders for our high-volume products or services, particularly our display products and services, our financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, our arrangements with and reliance on key customers may make it less practicable to pursue certain opportunities with other potential new and existing customers. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our ten largest customers accounted for 67%, 61% and 57% of our net sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Samsung Display represented 32.9% of the Company\u2019s net sales and 84.5% of our Display Solutions division\u2019s net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to Samsung Display represented 19.3% of the Company\u2019s net sales and 56.6% of our Display Solutions division\u2019s net sales, and LG Display represented 13.3% of the Company\u2019s net sales and 38.9% of our Display Solutions division\u2019s net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to LG Display represented 15.6% of the Company\u2019s net sales and 50.6% of our Display Solutions division\u2019s net sales. Significant reductions in sales to any of these customers, especially our few largest customers, the loss of other major customers or a general curtailment in orders for our high-volume products or services within a short period of time could adversely affect our business.\nThe average selling prices of our semiconductor products have at times declined rapidly and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross profit.\nThe semiconductor products we develop and sell are subject to rapid declines in average selling prices. From time to time, we have had to reduce our prices significantly to meet customer requirements, and we may be required to reduce our prices in the future. This would cause our gross profit to decrease. Our financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes,\nreducing our costs or developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profit.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our ability to compete could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and includes hundreds of companies, a number of which have achieved substantial market share within both our product categories and end markets. Current and prospective customers for our products and services evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our competitors. Some of our competitors are well established as independent companies and have substantially greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell their products in certain of our end markets and with the internal semiconductor design and manufacturing capabilities of many of our significant customers. We expect to experience continuing competitive pressures in our markets from existing competitors and new entrants.\nAny consolidation among our competitors could enhance their product offerings and financial resources, further enhancing their competitive position. Our ability to compete will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to offer cost-effective and high quality products and services on a timely basis using our technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to accurately identify and respond to emerging technological trends and demand for product features and performance characteristics;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to rapidly introduce new products that are accepted by the market;\n\u2022\nour ability to adopt or adapt to emerging industry standards;\n\u2022\nthe number and nature of our competitors and competitiveness of their products and services in a given market;\n\u2022\nentrance of new competitors into our markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter the highly competitive power management market; and\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to offer in demand foundry services at competitive prices.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control. In the future, our competitors may replace us as a supplier to our existing or potential customers, and our customers may satisfy more of their requirements internally. As a result, we may experience declining revenues and results of operations.\nChanges in demand for consumer electronics in our end markets can impact our results of operations.\nDemand for our products will depend in part on the demand for various consumer electronics products, in particular, mobile phones and multimedia devices, digital televisions, flat panel displays, mobile PCs and digital cameras, which in turn depends on general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. If our customers fail to introduce new products that employ our products or component parts, demand for our products will suffer. To the extent that we cannot offset periods of reduced demand that may occur in these markets through greater penetration of these markets or reduction in our production and costs, our sales and gross profit may decline, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to achieve design-wins for our semiconductor products, we may lose the opportunity for sales to customers for a significant period of time and be unable to recoup our investments in our products.\nWe expend considerable resources on winning competitive selection processes, known as design-wins, to develop semiconductor products for use in our customers\u2019 products. These selection processes are typically\nlengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures. Once a customer designs a semiconductor into a product, that customer is likely to continue to use the same semiconductor or enhanced versions of that semiconductor from the same supplier across a number of similar and successor products for a lengthy period of time due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier and potentially redesigning the product to incorporate a different semiconductor. If we fail to achieve initial design-wins in a customer\u2019s qualification process, we may lose the opportunity for significant sales to that customer for a number of products and for a lengthy period of time. This may cause us to be unable to recoup our investments in our semiconductor products, which would harm our business.\nWe have lengthy and expensive design-to-mass production and manufacturing process development cycles that may cause us to incur significant expenses without realizing meaningful sales, the occurrence of which would harm our business.\nThe cycle time from the design stage to mass production for some of our products is long and requires the investment of significant resources with many potential customers without any guarantee of sales. Our design-to-mass production cycle typically begins with a three-to-twelve month semiconductor development stage and test period followed by a three-to-twelve month end-product qualification period by our customers. The fairly lengthy front end of our sales cycle creates a risk that we may incur significant expenses but may be unable to realize meaningful sales. Moreover, prior to mass production, customers may decide to cancel their products or change production specifications, resulting in sudden changes in our product specifications, increasing our production time and costs. Failure to meet such specifications may also delay the launch of our products or result in lost sales.\nIn addition, we collaborate and jointly develop certain process technologies and manufacturing process flows customized for certain of our Foundry Services Groups customers. To the extent that our Foundry Services Group customers fail to achieve market acceptance for their products, we may be unable to recoup our engineering resources commitment and our investment in process technology development, which would harm our business.\nResearch and development investments may not yield profitable and commercially viable product and service offerings and thus will not necessarily result in increases in revenues for us.\nWe invest significant resources in our research and development. Our research and development efforts, however, may not yield commercially viable products or enhance our services offerings. During each stage of research and development, there is a substantial risk that we will have to abandon a potential product or service offering that is no longer marketable and in which we have invested significant resources. In the event we are able to develop viable new products or service offerings, a significant amount of time will have elapsed between our investment in the necessary research and development effort and the receipt of any related revenues.\nWe face numerous challenges relating to executing our growth strategy, and if we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy is to leverage our advanced analog and mixed-signal technology platform, continue to innovate and deliver new products and services, increase business with existing customers, broaden our customer base, aggressively grow our power business, drive execution excellence and focus on specialty process technologies. If we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. Moreover, if our allocation of resources does not correspond with future demand for particular products, we could miss market opportunities and our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations, and changes in the exchange rates of applicable currencies could impact our results of operations.\nHistorically, a portion of our revenues and greater than the majority of our operating expenses and costs of sales have been denominated in non-U.S. currencies, principally the Korean won, and we expect that this will remain true in the future. Because we report our results of operations in US dollars, changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar could materially impact our reported results of operations and distort period to period comparisons. In particular, because of the difference in the amount of our consolidated revenues and expenses that are in US dollars relative to Korean won, a depreciation in the US dollar relative to the Korean won could result in a material increase in reported costs relative to revenues, and therefore could cause our profit margins and operating income to appear to decline materially, particularly relative to prior periods. The converse is true if the US dollar were to appreciate relative to the Korean won. For example, foreign currency fluctuations had a favorable impact on our reported profit margins and operating income from operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 due to a relatively weaker Korean won during the period. Moreover, our foreign currency gain or loss would be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the Korean won and the US dollar as a substantial portion of non-cash translation gain or loss is associated with the intercompany long-term loans to our Korean subsidiary, which is denominated in US dollars. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding intercompany loan balance including accrued interests between our Korean subsidiary and our Dutch subsidiary was $686.5 million. Our Dutch subsidiary uses the US dollar as their functional currency. As a result of foreign currency fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our common stock or the price of the Exchangeable Notes or the 2021 Notes (each as defined below) could be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Our Korean subsidiary enters into foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts in order to mitigate a portion of the impact of US dollar-Korean won exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results. These foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts typically require us to sell specified notional amounts in US dollars and provide us the option to sell specified notional amounts in US dollars during successive months to our counterparty in exchange for Korean won at specified exchange rates. Obligations under these foreign currency forward and zero cost collar contracts must be cash collateralized if our exposure exceeds certain specified thresholds. These forward and zero cost collar contracts may be terminated by the counterparty in a number of circumstances, including if our long-term debt rating falls below B-/B3 or if our total cash and cash equivalents is less than $30 million at the end of a fiscal quarter. We cannot assure that any hedging technique we implement will be effective. If our hedging activities are not effective, changes in currency exchange rates may have a more significant impact on our results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Factors Affecting our Results of Operations\u201d for further details.\nThe loss of our key employees would materially adversely affect our business, and we may not be able to attract or retain the technical or management employees necessary to compete in our industry.\nOur key executives have substantial experience and have made significant contributions to our business, and our continued success is dependent upon the retention of our key management executives. The loss of such key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled technical and managerial personnel. We do not know whether we will be able to retain all of these employees as we continue to pursue our business strategy. The loss of the services of key employees, especially our key design and technical personnel, or our inability to retain, attract and motivate qualified design and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This could hinder our research and product development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we encounter future labor problems, we may fail to deliver our products and services in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1, 449 employees, or approximately 59% of our employees, were represented by the MagnaChip Semiconductor Labor Union. We can offer no assurance that any issues with the labor union and other employees will be resolved favorably for us in the future, that we will not experience work stoppages or other labor problems in future years or that we will not incur significant expenses related to such issues.\nWe may incur costs to engage in future business combinations or strategic investments, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may seek to enter into business combinations, investments, joint ventures and other strategic alliances with other companies in order to maintain and grow revenue and market presence as well as to provide us with access to technology, products and services. Any such transaction would be accompanied by risks that may harm our business, such as difficulties in assimilating the operations, personnel and products of an acquired business or in realizing the projected benefits, disruption of our ongoing business, potential increases in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and charges if the acquired company or assets are later determined to be worth less than the amount paid for them in an earlier original acquisition. In addition, our indebtedness may restrict us from making acquisitions that we may otherwise wish to pursue.\nThe failure to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields could adversely affect our business.\nThe manufacture of semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require precision, a highly regulated and sterile environment and specialized equipment. Defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can prevent us from achieving acceptable yields in the manufacturing of our products or those of our Foundry Services Group customers, which could lead to higher costs, a loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our products. Slight impurities or defects in the photomasks used to print circuits on a wafer or other factors can cause significant difficulties, particularly in connection with the production of a new product, the adoption of a new manufacturing process or any expansion of our manufacturing capacity and related transitions. We may also experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields as a result of, among other things, transferring production to other facilities, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies. Yields below our target levels can negatively impact our gross profit and may cause us to eliminate underperforming products.\nWe rely on a number of independent subcontractors and the failure of any of these independent subcontractors to perform as required could adversely affect our operating results.\nA substantial portion of our net sales are derived from semiconductor devices assembled in packages or on film. The packaging and testing of semiconductors require technical skill and specialized equipment. For the portion of packaging and testing that we outsource, we use subcontractors located in Korea, China, and Taiwan; however, we expect that we will only use the Korean and Chinese subcontractors for 2020. We rely on these subcontractors to package and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels. We could be adversely affected by political disorders, labor disruptions, public health issues (including viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 coronavirus), and natural disasters where our subcontractors are located. If our semiconductor packagers and test service providers experience problems in packaging and testing our semiconductor devices, experience prolonged quality or yield problems, experience shutdowns or delays associated with public health issues (such as those associated with the COVID-19 coronavirus), or decrease the capacity available to us, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe cooperate with independent foundries to produce certain advanced technology Display Solutions products, and the failure of such independent foundries to satisfy our demand could materially disrupt our business.\nWe use independent foundry services for certain of our OLED Display Solutions products that require more advanced technology than is available in our fabrication facilities. Silicon wafer production at these facilities is\nallocated solely by our vendors and beyond our direct control. Therefore, any disruption in wafer supply form these vendors could have a material impact on our revenue and results of operations.\nWe depend on successful parts and materials procurement for our manufacturing processes, and a shortage or increase in the price of these materials could interrupt our operations and result in a decline of revenues and results of operations.\nWe procure materials and electronic and mechanical components from international sources and original equipment manufacturers. We use a wide range of parts and materials in the production of our semiconductors, including silicon, processing chemicals, processing gases, precious metals and electronic and mechanical components, some of which, such as silicon wafers, are specialized raw materials that are generally only available from a limited number of suppliers. If demand increases or supply decreases for any reason, the costs of our raw materials could significantly increase. For example, worldwide supplies of silicon wafers, an important raw material for the semiconductors we manufacture, were constrained in recent years due to an increased demand for silicon. We from time to time may enter into multi-year agreements, which specify future quantities and pricing of materials to be supplied by the vendors of these materials; however, this option may not be available to us and we cannot assure that supply increases will match demand increases. If we cannot obtain adequate materials in a timely manner or on favorable terms for the manufacture of our products, revenues and results of operations will decline.\nCompliance with regulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain raw materials used in manufacturing our products.\nThe SEC, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, adopted disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures pertaining to a manufacturer\u2019s efforts regarding the source of such minerals. These \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. Manufacturers are also required to disclose their efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from them. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of metals used in the manufacture of our products. We may also incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as free of \u201cconflict materials,\u201d which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue.\nWe face warranty claims, product return, litigation and liability risks and the risk of negative publicity if our products fail.\nOur semiconductors are incorporated into a number of end products, and our business is exposed to product return, warranty and product liability risk and the risk of negative publicity if our products fail. Although we maintain insurance for product liability claims, the amount and scope of our insurance may not be adequate to cover a product liability claim that is asserted against us. In addition, product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and, in the future, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, we are exposed to the product liability risk and the risk of negative publicity affecting our customers. Our sales may decline if any of our customers are sued on a product liability claim. We also may suffer a decline in sales from the negative publicity associated with such a lawsuit or with adverse public perceptions in general regarding our customers\u2019 products. Further, if our products are delivered with impurities or defects, we could incur additional development, repair or replacement costs, and our credibility and the market\u2019s acceptance of our products could be harmed.\nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences as a result of changes in, or differences in the interpretation of, applicable tax laws, including the recently enacted tax reform legislation in the United States.\nOur company\u2019s organizational structure was created in part based on certain interpretations and conclusions regarding various tax laws, including withholding tax and other tax laws of applicable jurisdictions. Our interpretations and conclusions regarding tax laws, however, are not binding on any taxing authority and, if these interpretations and conclusions are incorrect, if our business were to be operated in a way that rendered us ineligible for tax exemptions or caused us to become subject to incremental tax, or if the authorities were to change, modify or have a different interpretation of the relevant tax laws, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences, and the anticipated benefits of our organizational structure could be materially impaired. Our company\u2019s organizational structure and other tax positions are subject to review by tax authorities in the local and other jurisdictions where we operate our business.\nIn December 2017, H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted in the US (the \u201cTax Reform\u201d). The Tax Reform reduces the US federal statutory rate to 21.0% from 35.0% effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform contains several key provisions that affect our assessment of deferred taxes, which include the remeasurement of deferred taxes, recognition of liabilities for taxes on mandatory deemed repatriation and certain other foreign income, and reassessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets. For further information regarding the impact of the Tax Reform, see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 17. Income Taxes\u201d included elsewhere in this Report.\nAdditional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign income, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. These changes, to the extent adopted, may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the U.S. In connection with the OECD\u2019s BEPS project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of income earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRecent changes in international trade policy and the imposition and threats of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nSince the beginning of 2018, there have been increasing public threats and, in some cases, legislative or executive action, from US and foreign leaders regarding instituting tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials. More specifically, since March of 2018, the US and China have applied tariffs to certain of each other\u2019s exports. The institution of trade tariffs globally, and between the US and China specifically, may negatively impacting China\u2019s overall economic condition, which could negatively affect demand for our products in China and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations of our customers serving the China markets. Furthermore, imposition of tariffs could increase costs of the end-user products we supply or those manufactured by our Foundry Services Group that we may not be able to pass on to our customers, which could in turn cause a decrease in the sales of our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technology and know-how, as well as our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the US and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, mask works and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the US. In particular, the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property in China, where we derive a significant portion of our net sales, and certain other countries where we derive net sales, are uncertain and still evolving and historically have not protected, and may not protect in the future, intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws and enforcement procedures in the US. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how through the use of patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other security measures. The process of seeking patent protection takes a long time and is expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from pending or future applications or that, if patents issue, they will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. Many of our patents are subject to cross licenses, several of which are with our competitors. Some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. The confidentiality agreements on which we rely to protect these technologies may be breached and may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies. Further, it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technologies, even without access to our proprietary technologies.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We have no means of knowing what patent applications have been filed until they are published. In addition, the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We may need to file lawsuits to enforce our patents or intellectual property rights, and we may need to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others. Any litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our resources, and we cannot assure you that we will prevail. Any claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation against use, even those without merit, could require us to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages or indemnify customers or licensees for damages they may suffer if the products they purchase from us or the technology they license from us violate the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nstop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of the accused products;\n\u2022\nredesign, reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue processes; or\n\u2022\nobtain licenses to a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nThere can be no assurance that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe license certain intellectual property from third parties. The termination of key third-party licenses relating to the use of intellectual property in our products and our design processes, such as our agreements with Silicon Works Co., Ltd. and ARM Limited, would materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur expenses could increase if SK hynix were unwilling or unable to provide certain services related to our shared facilities with SK hynix, and if SK hynix were to become insolvent, we could lose certain of our leases.\nWe are party to a land lease and easement agreement with SK hynix pursuant to which we lease the land for our facilities in Cheongju, Korea. If this agreement were terminated for any reason, including the insolvency of SK hynix, we would have to renegotiate new lease terms with SK hynix or the new owner of the land. We cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate new lease terms on favorable terms or at all. Because we share certain facilities with SK hynix, several services that are essential to our business are provided to us by or through SK hynix under our general service supply agreement with SK hynix. These services include electricity, bulk gases and de-ionized water, campus facilities and housing, wastewater and sewage management, environmental safety and certain utilities and infrastructure support services. If any of our agreements with SK hynix were terminated or if SK hynix were unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations to us under the terms of these agreements, we would have to procure these services on our own and as a result may experience an increase in our expenses.\nWe are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could affect our operations or result in significant expenses.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the generation, use, handling, storage and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances (including asbestos) and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Among them is the Act on Remediation and Compensation for Damages arising from Environmental Contamination which came into effect in Korea on January 1, 2016 and provides for strict liability of business entities in violation of the act and alleviates the burden of proof for the damaged party. Further, under the amendment to the Act on the Control and Aggravated Punishment of Environmental Offenses that becomes effective on November 27, 2020, certain environmental offenses such as illegally emitting specified hazardous air pollutants or emitting air pollutants without necessary permits will be subject to penalties of up to 5% of the sales amount generated from the relevant business. As a result, we have increased potential exposure to liability for environmental contaminations that might have existed in the past or would arise in the future. There can be no assurance that we have been, or will be, in compliance with all such laws and regulations or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these laws and regulations in the future. The adoption of new environmental, health and safety laws, the failure to comply with new or existing laws, or issues relating to hazardous substances could subject us to material liability (including substantial fines or penalties), impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon us, curtail our operations or restrict our ability to expand operations.\nOur Korean subsidiary has been designated as a regulated business under Korean environmental law, and such designation could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nSince 2015, our Korean subsidiary has been subject to K-ETS, a new set of greenhouse gas emissions regulation, under the Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances. Under K-ETS, our Korean subsidiary was allocated a certain amount of emissions allowance in accordance with the National Allocation Plan prepared by the Korean government, and is required to meet its allocated target by either reducing the emissions or purchasing the allowances from other participants or the government in the emission trading market. Reduction of our emissions or energy consumption may result in additional and potentially costly\ncompliance or remediation expenses, including potentially the installation of equipment and changes in the type of materials we use in manufacturing, as well as cost of procuring emission allowances to cover the excess emissions, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. During the first implementation period from 2015 to 2017, we did not exceed the allocated emission amount. We are in the second implementation period that covers from 2018 to 2020. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the emissions allowance for the referred 3-year period on a cumulative basis as well as for an individual year basis. As of December 31, 2019, we had a sufficient emissions allowance and, accordingly, no liability was recorded. In addition, from time to time, if we assess that we have excess allowances, we may sell such excess allowances to manufacturers in the emission market in Korea. However, it is expected that the total emission allowances to be allocated by the government will be significantly reduced in the third implementation period from 2021 to 2025 to achieve the 2030 National GHG Reduction Goal. Further, as the number of businesses subject to paid allocation of GHG emission allowances will increase, and the proportion of the paid allocation for each subject business will increase from 3% to 10% or more in the third implementation period, the subject businesses\u2019 costs to comply with the GHG emission limit is expected to significantly increase.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require more capital in the future from equity or debt financings to fund operating expenses, such as research and development costs, finance investments in equipment and infrastructure, acquire complementary businesses and technologies, and respond to competitive pressures and potential strategic opportunities. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new shares we issue could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any additional equity or debt financing would be available to us, or if available, that such financing would be on favorable terms to us. Accordingly, if we are unable to obtain additional capital or our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures, and our cash reserves are depleted, we may need to take various actions, such as down-sizing and/or eliminating certain operations, which could include additional exit costs, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, or other restructuring actions. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in taking such actions and, in any event, such actions may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, our indebtedness limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness under certain circumstances.\nOur business depends on international customers, suppliers and operations in Asia, and as a result we are subject to regulatory, operational, financial and political risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, suppliers, subcontractors and operations located primarily in Asia. As a result, we face risks inherent in international operations, such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other market barriers, political, social and economic instability, adverse tax consequences, war, civil disturbances and acts of terrorism, public health issues (including viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 coronavirus), difficulties in accounts receivable collection, extended payment terms and differing labor standards, enforcement of contractual obligations and protection of intellectual property. These risks may lead to increased costs or decreased revenue growth, or both.\nFor example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus causing a disease known as COVID-19 surfaced in Wuhan, China, resulting in significant disruptions among Chinese manufacturing and other facilities and travel throughout China. While the extent of the impact of the current COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak on our results is uncertain, a continued and prolonged public health crisis such as the COVID-19 coronavirus could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTensions with North Korea could have an adverse effect on us and the market value of our shares.\nRelations between South Korea and North Korea have been tense throughout Korea\u2019s modern history. The level of tension between the two Koreas has fluctuated and may increase abruptly as a result of current and future events. In particular, in recent years, there have been heightened security concerns stemming from North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapon and long-range missile programs and increased uncertainty regarding North Korea\u2019s actions and possible responses from the international community.\nNorth Korea\u2019s economy also faces severe challenges, and any adverse economic developments may further aggravate social and political tensions within North Korea.\nAlthough we do not derive any revenue from, nor sell any products in, North Korea, any future increase in tensions between South Korea and North Korea that may occur, for example, if North Korea experiences a leadership crisis, high-level contacts between South Korea and North Korea break down, or military hostilities occur, could have a material adverse effect on the South Korean economy and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market value of our common stock.\nWe may be subject to disruptions, breaches or cyber-attacks of our secured networks and information technology systems that could damage our reputation, harm our business, expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including IP and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners. Secure maintenance, processing and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We may be subject to disruptions, breaches or cyber-attacks of our secured networks and information technology systems caused by illegal hacking, criminal fraud or impersonation, computer viruses, acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error, and our security measures or those of any third party service providers we use may not detect or prevent such security breaches. We may incur significant costs to eliminate or alleviate cybersecurity breaches and vulnerabilities, which could be significant, and our efforts to protect against such breaches or vulnerabilities may not be successful and could result in system interruptions that may materially impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution, finance or other critical functions. Any such compromise of our information security could also result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business, an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized transfer of cash or other assets, the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business and/or expose us to material monetary liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nYou may not be able to bring an action or enforce any judgment obtained in United States courts, or bring an action in any other jurisdiction, against us or our subsidiaries or our directors, officers or independent auditors that are organized or residing in jurisdictions other than the United States.\nMost of our subsidiaries are organized or incorporated outside of the US and some of our directors and executive officers as well as our independent auditors are organized or reside outside of the US. Most of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 assets are located outside of the US and in particular, in Korea. Accordingly, any judgment obtained in the US against us or our subsidiaries may not be collectible in the US. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the US upon these persons or to enforce against them or us court judgments obtained in the US that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the US or of the securities laws of any state of the US. In particular, there is doubt as to the enforceability in Korea or any other jurisdictions outside the US, either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of US courts, of civil liabilities predicated on the federal securities laws of the US or the securities laws of any state of the US.\nOur level of indebtedness is substantial, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. A decline in the ratings of our existing or future indebtedness may make the terms of any new indebtedness we choose to incur more costly.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness was $304.7 million, which represents the principal amount outstanding under our 6.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (\u201c2021 Notes\u201d) and 5.0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2021 (\u201cExchangeable Notes\u201d), excluding $3.2 million of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs. We are permitted under the indentures governing our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes to incur additional debt under certain conditions, including additional secured debt. If new debt were to be incurred in the future, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our substantial debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt or fail to comply with the financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit our lenders to foreclose on the assets securing any such debt;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u2022\nnegatively affecting our ability to fund a change of control offer.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure that we will generate a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nThe credit ratings assigned to our debt reflect each rating agency\u2019s opinion of our ability to make payments on the debt obligations when such payments are due. A rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. We may experience downgrades in our debt ratings in the future. Any lowering of our debt ratings would adversely impact our ability to raise additional debt financing and increase the cost of any such financing that is obtained. In the event any ratings downgrades are significant, we may choose not to incur new debt or refinance existing debt if we are unable to incur or refinance such debt at favorable interest rates or on favorable terms.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or if we are unable to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and thus render us unable to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indentures governing our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or be able to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nWe are a holding company and will depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes and other obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no independent operations of our own. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of the operations necessary to fund payments on our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes, other debt and any other obligations. Our ability to make payments on our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes and our other obligations will depend on our subsidiaries\u2019 cash flow and their payment of funds to us. Our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make payments to us will depend on:\n\u2022\ntheir earnings;\n\u2022\ncovenants contained in our debt agreements (including the indentures governing our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes) and the debt agreements of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ncovenants contained in other agreements to which we or our subsidiaries are or may become subject;\n\u2022\nbusiness and tax considerations; and\n\u2022\napplicable law, including any restrictions under Korean law that may be imposed on MagnaChip Korea that would restrict its ability to make payments on intercompany loans from MagnaChip Semiconductor B.V.\nWe cannot assure that the operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make distributions or other payments to us or that any distributions or payments will be adequate to pay principal and interest, and any other payments, on our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes, other debt or any other obligations when due, and the failure to make such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on MagnaChip Korea\u2019s ability to make payments on its intercompany loans from MagnaChip Semiconductor B.V., or on its ability to pay dividends in excess of statutory limitations, could hinder our ability to make payments on our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes.\nWe anticipate that payments under our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes will be funded in part by MagnaChip Korea\u2019s repayment of its existing loans from MagnaChip Semiconductor B.V., with MagnaChip Semiconductor B.V. using such repayments in turn to repay the loans owed to us or to MagnaChip Semiconductor S.A., which will repay loans owed to us. Under the Korean Foreign Exchange Transaction Act, the minister of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance is authorized to temporarily suspend payments in foreign currencies in the event of natural calamities, wars, conflicts of arms, grave and sudden changes in domestic or foreign economic conditions, or other similar situations. In addition, under the Korean Commercial Code, a Korean company is permitted to make a dividend payment in accordance with the provisions in its articles of incorporation out of retained earnings (as determined in accordance with the Korean Commercial Code and the generally accepted accounting principles in Korea), but no more than twice a year. If MagnaChip Korea is prevented from making payments under its intercompany loans due to restrictions on payments of foreign currency or if it has an insufficient amount of retained earnings under the Korean Commercial Code to make dividend payments to MagnaChip Semiconductor B.V., we and MagnaChip Semiconductor S.A. may not have sufficient funds to make payments on our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes contain, and our future debt agreements will likely contain, covenants that significantly restrict our operations.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes contain, and our future debt agreements will likely contain, numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and may adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including by restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and by limiting our ability to\nengage in other business activities. These covenants will place restrictions on our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\npay dividends, redeem shares or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, make payments with respect to subordinated indebtedness or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nincur debt or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, taken as a whole;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise transfer or dispose of assets, including equity interests of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, our future debt agreements will likely contain financial ratios and other financial conditions tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests could be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will meet those ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under such debt agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under such debt agreements, our lenders under such agreements could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes.\nHolders of the Exchangeable Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Exchangeable Notes surrendered therefor. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Exchangeable Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of our then-existing indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Exchangeable Notes.\nA fundamental change may adversely affect us.\nA fundamental change could have a negative effect on us and the trading price of the common stock and Exchangeable Notes. Furthermore, the fundamental change provisions, including the provisions requiring the increase in the exchange rate for exchanges in connection with a fundamental change prior to the maturity date, may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a takeover of our company and the removal of incumbent management.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other\nfactors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nFrom the time we began operations as a separate entity in 2004 until we emerged from our 2009 reorganization proceedings under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, we generated significant net losses and did not generate a profit for a full fiscal year. In addition, since 2013 until 2017, we again had substantial net losses despite some improvements made in 2017. While our operating income was $47.4 million and $24.4 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively, our net loss was $3.9 million and $21.8 million in those same periods. We may increase spending to support increased research and development and sales and marketing efforts. These expenditures may not result in increased revenue or an increase in the number of customers immediately or at all. Because many of our expenses are fixed in the short term, or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales. If we cannot maintain profitability, the value of the enterprise may decline.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments. We will not be restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due.\nWe may need to incur impairment, restructuring and other restructuring related charges, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring industry downturns and for other reasons, we may need to record impairment, restructuring or other restructuring related charges. Although we recognized a net restructuring and other gain of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, we also recorded early termination charges of $13.4 million for the same period in connection with our workforce reduction efforts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized aggregate restructuring and other charges of $9.2 million, of which $7.0 million in professional fees and other charges incurred in connection with the strategic evaluation. In the future, we may need to record additional impairment charges or to further restructure our business or incur additional restructuring charges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to litigation risks, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain.\nAll industries, including the semiconductor industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit, that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. We are involved in a variety of legal matters, most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business. These routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving customers, employment and labor and intellectual property. Even if the final outcome of these legal claims does not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, defense and settlement costs can be substantial. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal\nclaim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or a part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock might be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could affect the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter or year to year;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant agreements, technological innovations or strategic alliances;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations or estimates by any securities analysts who follow our securities;\n\u2022\naddition or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic performance or market valuations of competing companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry, end markets and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nsubsequent sales of stock and other financings; and\n\u2022\nlitigation, legislation, regulation or technological developments that adversely affect our business.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against the public company. Regardless of its outcome, this type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and a likely diversion of our management\u2019s attention. You may not receive a positive return on your investment when you sell your shares, and you could lose some or the entire amount of your investment.\nSignificant ownership of our common stock by certain stockholders could adversely affect our other stockholders.\nThe concentration of ownership of our common stock by certain stockholders may limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our public stockholders do not view as beneficial. For example, our concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, our non-employee directors and non-employee holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock do not have a duty to refrain from engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar activities or lines of business as those engaged in by us, our subsidiaries and other related parties. Also, we have renounced any interest or expectancy in such business opportunities even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted an opportunity to do so.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware Law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us and could depress the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine;\n\u2022\nprohibit action by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit any person other than our Board of Directors, the chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer or holders of at least 25% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to call a special meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nspecify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), regulating corporate takeovers and which has an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board of Directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock. In general, those provisions prohibit a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u2022\nthe transaction is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that status;\n\u2022\nupon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced; or\n\u2022\non or after such date, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nIn general, DGCL Section 203 defines a business combination to include the following:\n\u2022\nany merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder;\n\u2022\nany sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder;\n\u2022\nsubject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder;\n\u2022\nany transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or\n\u2022\nthe receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation.\nIn general, DGCL Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by any such entity or person.\nA Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of, and do not currently intend to opt out of, this provision.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore, investors should rely on sales of their common stock as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends on common stock is restricted under the terms of the indentures for our outstanding Exchangeable Notes and 2021 Notes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.", "PERMNO": 12629, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "MX"}
