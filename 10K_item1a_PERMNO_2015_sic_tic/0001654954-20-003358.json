{"cik": "1023364", "company": "AutoWeb, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below are not the only risks that we face. The following risks as well as risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, earnings per share, cash flow or the trading price of our stock, individually and collectively referred to in these Risk Factors as our \u201cfinancial performance.\u201d See also the discussion of \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d immediately preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may be unable to increase Lead revenues and could continue to suffer a declining in revenues due to dealer attrition.\nWe derive more than 99% of our Lead revenues from Lead generation paid by Dealers and Manufacturers participating in our Lead programs. Our Lead generation decreased $6.2 million, or 6%, in 2019 compared to 2018. Our ability to increase revenues from sales of Leads is dependent on a mix of interrelated factors that include increasing Lead revenues by attracting and retaining Dealers and Manufacturers and increasing the number of high-quality Leads we sell to Dealers and Manufacturers. We are also focused on higher revenue Dealers that are more cost-effective to support. Our sales strategy is intended to result in more profitable relationships with our Dealers both in terms of cost to supply Leads and to support the Dealers. Dealer churn impacts our revenues, and if our sales strategy does not mitigate the loss in revenues by maintaining the overall number of Leads sold by increasing sales to other Dealers or Manufacturers while maintaining the overall margins we receive from the Leads sold, our revenues will decrease. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to increase Lead generation revenues, prevent Dealer attrition or offset the revenues lost due to Dealer attrition by other means, and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may lose customers or quality Lead supplies to our competitors.\nOur ability to provide increased numbers of high-quality Leads to our customers is dependent on increasing the number of Internally-Generated Leads and acquiring high-quality Non-Internally-Generated Leads from third parties. Originating Internally-Generated Leads is dependent on our ability to increase consumer traffic to our Company Websites by providing secure and easy to use websites with relevant and quality content for consumers and increasing visibility of our brands to consumers and by our SEM activities. We compete for Dealer and Manufacturer customers and for acquisition of Non-Internally-Generated Leads with companies that maintain automotive Lead referral businesses that are very similar to ours. Many of these competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources than we have. If we lose customers or quality Lead supply volume to our competitors, or if our pricing or cost to acquire Leads is impacted, our financial performance will be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur financial performance could be materially and adversely affected by changes in internet search engine algorithms, pricing or operational dynamics.\nWe use Google to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites, and, to a lesser extent, we use other search engines and meta-search websites to generate traffic to our websites, principally through pay-per-click advertising campaigns. The pricing and operating dynamics on these search engines can experience rapid change commercially, technically and competitively. For example, Google frequently updates and changes the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a consumer's search, such that the placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected and our costs to improve or maintain our placement in search results can increase. Our ability to continue to use Google could be impacted as a result of the Company\u2019s credit position. Our financial performance would be materially and adversely impacted if we were no longer able to use Google for generation of traffic to our websites.\nWe are affected by general economic and market conditions, and, in particular, conditions in the automotive industry.\nOur financial performance is affected by general economic and market factors, conditions in the automotive industry, and the market for automotive marketing services, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nPricing and purchase incentives for vehicles;\n\u25cf\nThe expectation that consumers will be purchasing fewer vehicles overall during their lifetime as a result of better-quality vehicles and longer warranties;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of fuel prices on demand for the number and types of vehicles;\n\u25cf\nIncreases or decreases in the number of retail Dealers or in the number of Manufacturers and other wholesale customers in our customer base;\n\u25cf\nVolatility in spending by Manufacturers and others in their marketing budgets and allocations;\n\u25cf\nThe competitive impact of consolidation in the online automotive consumer referral industry;\n\u25cf\nThe effect of changes in transportation policy, including the potential increase of public transportation options;\n\u25cf\nThe effect of fewer vehicles being purchased as a result of new business models and changes in consumer attitudes regarding the need for vehicle ownership; and\n\u25cf\nDisruption in the automotive manufacturing and parts supply chains caused by natural disasters, adverse weather and other events may affect the supply of vehicle and parts inventories to Manufacturer\u2019s and Dealers.\nIn early 2020 and continuing as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to quarantines and stay-at-home/work-from-home orders in a number of countries, states, cities and regions and the closure or limited access to public and private offices and facilities, worldwide, causing widespread disruptions to travel, economic activity and financial markets. The outbreak has led our Manufacturer and Dealer customers to experience disruptions in the (i) supply of vehicle and parts inventories, (ii) ability and willingness of consumers to visit automotive dealerships to purchase or lease vehicles and (iii) overall health and availability of their labor force. Recent volatility in the financial markets, concerns about exposure to the virus and governmental quarantines and stay-at-home/work-from-home orders have also impacted consumer confidence and willingness to visit dealerships and to purchase or lease vehicles, notwithstanding financing and leasing incentives being offered by Manufacturers. These disruptions have impacted the willingness or desire of our customers to acquire vehicle Leads or other digital marketing services from us. We are also experiencing direct disruptions to our operations due to the overall health of, and concerns for, our labor force and as a result of governmental \u201csocial distancing\u201d programs, quarantines, travel restrictions and stay-at-home/work-from-home orders, leading to office closures, operating from employee homes and restrictions on our employees traveling to our various offices. If automotive manufacturing and parts supply chains are impacted for an extended period of time, vehicle production may fall, and new vehicle inventories on Dealer lots could diminish. This may put pressure on the new vehicle market as Dealers may likely shift to selling used cars, assuming that Dealers are able to obtain used vehicle inventories from trade-ins and used vehicle auctions. Although some Manufacturers are implementing new marketing and incentive programs, continued disruption from the impact of the virus could cause Manufacturers to pull back on marketing and incentives, which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Concerns about the outbreak may continue to cause volatility in the financial markets and result in further economic downturn. At this time, the eventual extent and magnitude of the disruptions caused by the outbreak on the automotive industry in general and on us specifically are not known, but vehicle sales have declined significantly in recent weeks, and we are experiencing cancellations or suspensions of purchases of Leads and other digital marketing services by our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nConcentration of credit risk and risks due to significant customers could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with one financial institution in the United States. Deposits held by banks exceed the amount of insurance provided for such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand. Accounts receivable are primarily derived from fees billed to Dealers and Manufacturers. We have a concentration of credit risk with our automotive industry related accounts receivable balances, particularly with Urban Science Applications (which represents several Manufacturer programs), Carat Detroit. During 2019, approximately 25% of our total revenues were derived from these two customers, and approximately 33% or $8.4 million of gross accounts receivable related to these two customers at December 31, 2019. No collateral is required to support our accounts receivables, and we maintain an allowance for bad debts for potential credit losses. If there is a decline in the general economic environment that negatively affects the financial condition of our customers or an increase in the number of customers that are dissatisfied with their services, additional estimated allowances for bad debts and customer credits may be required, and the adverse impact on our financial performance could be material.\nWe depend on Manufacturers through our third-party sales channel for a significant amount of our advertising revenues, and we may not be able to maintain or grow these relationships.\nWe depend on Manufacturers through our third-party sales channel for a significant amount of our advertising revenues. A decline in the level of advertising on our websites, reductions in advertising rates or any significant failure to develop additional sources of advertising would cause our advertising revenues to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. We periodically negotiate revisions to existing agreements and these revisions could decrease our advertising revenues in future periods and a number of our advertising agreements with Manufacturers may be terminated at any time without cause. We may not be able to maintain our relationships with Manufacturers on favorable terms or find alternative comparable relationships capable of replacing advertising revenues on terms satisfactory to us. If we cannot do so, our advertising revenues would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur ability to maintain and add to our relationships with advertisers and thereby increase advertising revenues is dependent on our ability to attract consumers and acquire traffic to our Company Websites and monetize that traffic at profitable margins with advertisers. Our consumer facing websites compete with offerings from the major internet portals, transaction-based sites, automotive-related verticals (websites with content that is primarily automotive in nature) and numerous lifestyle websites. Our advertising business is characterized by minimal barriers to entry, and new competitors may be able to launch competitive services at relatively low costs. If our Company Websites do not provide a compelling, differentiated user experience, we may lose visitors to competing sites, and if our website traffic declines, we may lose relevance to our major advertisers who may reduce or eliminate their advertising buys from us, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial performance.\nUncertainty exists in the application of various laws and regulations to our business. New laws or regulations applicable to our business, or expansion or interpretation of existing laws and regulations to apply to our business, could subject us to licensing, claims, judgments and remedies, including monetary liabilities and limitations on our business practices, and could increase administrative costs or materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a regulatory climate in which there is uncertainty as to the application of various laws and regulations to our business. Our business could be significantly affected by different interpretations or applications of existing laws or regulations, future laws or regulations, or actions or rulings by judicial or regulatory authorities. Our operations may be subjected to adoption, expansion or interpretation of various laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain licenses at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial and annual expense. These additional expenditures may increase future overhead, thereby potentially reducing our future results of operations. There can be no assurances that future laws or regulations or interpretations or expansions of existing laws or regulations will not impose requirements on internet commerce that could substantially impair the growth of e-commerce and adversely affect our financial performance. The adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the popularity or impede the expansion of e-commerce and internet marketing, restrict our present business practices, require us to implement costly compliance procedures or expose us and/or our customers to potential liability.\nWe may be deemed to \u201coperate\u201d or \u201cdo business\u201d in states where our customers conduct their business, resulting in regulatory action. If any state licensing laws were determined to be applicable to us, and if we are required to be licensed and we are unable to do so, or we are otherwise unable to comply with laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines or other penalties or be compelled to discontinue operations in those states. In the event any state\u2019s regulatory requirements impose state specific requirements on us or include us within an industry-specific regulatory scheme, we may be required to modify our marketing programs in that state in a manner that may undermine the program\u2019s attractiveness to consumers or Dealers. In the alternative, if we determine that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate operations in that state. In each case, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. We have identified below areas of government regulation, which if changed or interpreted to apply to our business, we believe could be costly for us and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nAutomotive Dealer/ Broker and Vehicle Advertising Laws. All states comprehensively regulate vehicle sales and lease transactions, including strict licensure requirements for Dealers (and, in some states, brokers) and vehicle advertising. Most of these laws and regulations, we believe, specifically address only traditional vehicle purchase and lease transactions, not internet-based Lead referral programs such as our programs. If we determine that the licensing or other regulatory requirements in a given state are applicable to us or to a particular marketing services program, we may elect to obtain required licenses and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. However, if licensing or other regulatory requirements are overly burdensome, we may elect to terminate operations or particular marketing services programs in that state or elect to not operate or introduce particular marketing services programs in that state. In some states we have modified our marketing programs or pricing models to reduce uncertainty regarding our compliance with local laws. As we introduce new services, we may need to incur additional costs associated with additional licensing regulations and regulatory requirements.\nFinancial Broker and Consumer Credit Laws. Through our websites consumers can click through to Dealer, Manufacturer and potential lender websites to obtain information regarding automotive financing. All online applications for financing quotes are completed on the respective third-party\u2019s websites. We receive marketing fees from financial institutions and Dealers in connection with this marketing activity. We do not demand, nor do we receive any fees from consumers for these services. In the event states require us to be licensed as a financial broker or finder, we may be unable to comply with a state\u2019s laws or regulations, or we could be required to incur significant fees and expenses to obtain any financial broker required license and comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act established a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad regulatory powers, which could lead to regulation of our advertising business directly or indirectly through regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions. California and other states may expand or create new state level consumer financial protection agencies that could lead to increased regulation of our business.\nInsurance Broker Laws. We provide links on our websites and referrals from call centers enabling consumers to be referred to third parties to receive quotes for insurance from such third parties. All online applications for quotes are completed on the respective insurance carriers\u2019 or other third-party websites, and all applications for quotes obtained through call center referrals are conducted by the insurance carrier or other third-party. We receive marketing fees from participants in connection with this marketing activity. We do not receive any premiums from consumers nor do we charge consumers fees for our services.\nChanges in the taxation of internet commerce may result in increased costs.\nBecause our business is dependent on the internet, the adoption of new local, state or federal tax laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations by governmental authorities may subject us to additional local, state or federal sales, use or income taxes and could decrease the growth of internet usage or marketing or the acceptance of internet commerce which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our services and increase our costs. As a result, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. State taxing authorities are reviewing and re-evaluating the tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce, including the application of sales taxes to internet marketing businesses similar to ours, as a source of tax revenues. We accrue for tax contingencies based upon our estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid, which we update over time as more information becomes available, new legislation or rules are adopted or taxing authorities interpret their existing statutes and rules to apply to internet commerce, including internet marketing businesses similar to ours. The amounts ultimately paid in resolution of reviews or audits by taxing authorities could differ materially from the amounts we have accrued and result in additional tax expense, and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial performance.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d). The legislation implements many new U.S. domestic and international tax provisions. It is possible that the TCJA, as well as existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be changed, modified or applied adversely to us, and such effect could be material to our financial performance.\nLiquidity Risks\nIf we are unable to generate positive cash flows, we will not be able to continue operations unless we are able to obtain additional cash through private or public sales of securities, debt financings or partnering/licensing transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.9 million and restricted cash of $5.1 million, a net loss of $15.2 million and used $9.4 million net cash in operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $342.9 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of $21.1 million.\nOn January 16, 2020, the Company received a notice of event of default and reservation of rights (\u201cNotice\u201d) from PNC Bank, under the PNC Credit Agreement advising that an event of default had occurred and is continuing under Section 10.3 of the PNC Credit Agreement by reason of AutoWeb\u2019s failure to deliver to PNC the financial statements and related compliance certificate for the month ended November 30, 2019. Although not covered by the Notice at this time, AutoWeb also is not in compliance with the minimum EBITDA financial covenant under the PNC Credit Agreement. As a result of the Notice, PNC has increased the interest rate under the PNC Credit Agreement by 2.0% per annum.\nThe Notice advised AutoWeb that PNC (i) specifically reserves all rights and remedies available to it under the PNC Credit Agreement and (ii) does not waive the event of default or any other event of default that may exist on the date of the Notice or which may occur thereafter. The Notice further advised that any loans, advances, and extensions of credit made to AutoWeb from time to time, will be at the sole discretion of PNC and will not constitute a waiver of the event of default, or a waiver by PNC of any of its rights under the PNC Credit Agreement or any collateral agreement.\nOn March 26, 2020, the Company entered into a $20.0 million Loan, Security and Guarantee Agreement (\u201cCNC Credit Agreement\u201d) with CIT Northbridge Credit LLC, as agent, and the Company\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries Car.com, Inc. Autobytel, Inc. and AW GUA USA, Inc., as Guarantor, and the PNC Credit Agreement was terminated. (See Note 13 of the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the terms of the CNC Credit Agreement).\nThe CNC Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital, as could any additional debt financing that we may secure in the future that could involve additional restrictive covenants. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we continue to experience losses and cannot comply with covenants in the CNC Credit Agreement or if our borrowing base limits are diminished, we may be unable to borrow sufficient funds under the CNC Credit Agreement to satisfy our future cash needs. Although we have developed a strategic plan with the objective to generate sustainable profitability throughout 2020, if our plans are unsuccessful, we will need to seek to satisfy our future cash needs through private or public sales of securities, debt financings or partnering/licensing transactions. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in satisfying our future cash needs such that we will be able to continue operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to, implementing new strategic plans, modernizing and upgrading our technology and systems, pursuing business objectives and responding to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, developing new or improving existing products or services, enhancing our operating infrastructure and acquiring complementary businesses and technologies. To the extent that our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to engage in equity or additional or alternative debt financings to secure additional funds.\nWe may require additional capital to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including to develop new products or services, improve existing products and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As a result, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us.\nWe may require additional capital to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available to us, or is not available on favorable terms, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may require additional capital to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including to develop new products or services, improve existing products and services, enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As a result, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nAny debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants that may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to implement new strategic plans, modernize and upgrade our technology and systems, pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nData Security and Privacy Risks\nOur business is subject to various laws, rules and regulations relating to data security and privacy. New data security and privacy laws, rules and regulations may be adopted regarding the internet or other online services that could limit our business flexibility or cause us to incur higher compliance costs. In each case, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. Identified below are some of these risks that we believe could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nAnti-spam laws, rules and regulations. Various state and federal laws, rules and regulations regulate email communications and internet advertising and restrict or prohibit unsolicited email (commonly known as \u201cspam\u201d). These laws, rules or regulations may adversely affect our ability to market our services to consumers in a cost-effective manner. The federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (\u201cCAN-SPAM\u201d) imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with sending commercial emails. In addition, state laws regulating the sending of commercial emails, including California\u2019s law regulating the sending of commercial emails, to the extent found to not be preempted by CAN-SPAM, may impose requirements or conditions more restrictive than CAN-SPAM. Violation of these laws, rules or regulations may result in monetary fines or penalties or damage to our reputation.\nData handling and privacy laws, rules and regulations. Various laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sale, disclosure, sharing and security of data that we receive from consumers, customers, advertisers and Lead referral and advertising affiliates. In addition, we have and post on our website our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, retention, sale, disclosure, sharing and security of user data and personal information. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Further, failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, sharing or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to our brands, and ultimately in a loss of consumers, customers, advertisers or Lead referral and advertising affiliates. We cannot predict whether new legislation or regulations concerning data privacy and retention issues related to our business will be adopted, or if adopted, whether they could impose requirements that may result in a decrease in our Lead referrals and materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Proposals that have or are currently being considered include restrictions relating to the collection and use of data and information obtained through the tracking of internet use, including the possible implementation of a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d list, that would allow internet users to opt-out of such tracking. Other proposals include enhanced rights for consumers to obtain information regarding the sharing or sale of their personal information and rights to opt-out or prevent the sharing or sale of their personal information to third parties, similar to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. The State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which includes significant new personal information privacy rights for consumers, including rights to know about the personal information collected and sold by a business, have a consumer\u2019s personal information deleted, and to opt-out of any sales of the consumer\u2019s personal information. The law became effective on January 1, 2020, and final regulations under the act are in the process of being drafted. Although it is too soon to evaluate the impact this legislation may Other states have enacted data privacy legislation and other states may do so in the future. Compliance with these laws, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial performance.\nSecurity risks associated with online Leads collection and referral, advertising and e-commerce risks associated with other online fraud and scams. A significant issue for online businesses like ours is the secure transmission of confidential and personal information over public networks. Concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy issues have been significant barriers to growth in consumer use of the internet, online advertising and e-commerce. Despite our implementation of security detection, prevention and monitoring measures, our computer systems or those of our vendors are susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptive harms and security breaches. For example, on January 9, 2020 the Company discovered that its network was impacted by malware that encrypted servers on most systems and disrupted consumer and customer access to many of the Company\u2019s services, although the Company has not discovered evidence that caused it to conclude that there has been any unauthorized access to or acquisition of any consumer personal information or customer confidential information. In addition, consumers may experience losses of personally identifiable information as a result of corporate identity theft. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may specifically compromise our security measures. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures on a timely basis. Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information that we collect or store, whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our reputation and brands, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain our audiences, or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers or Lead or traffic suppliers. If consumers experience identity theft related to personally identifiable information we collect or store, we may be exposed to liability, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. To the extent that unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information or corporate identity theft gives rise to reluctance to use our websites or to supply us leads or traffic, or a decline in consumer confidence in financial transactions over the internet, our business could be adversely affected. Alleged or actual breaches of the network of one of our business partners or competitors whom consumers associate with us could also harm our reputation and brands. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. For example, California law requires companies to inform individuals of any security breaches that result in their personal information being stolen. Because our success depends on the acceptance of online services and e-commerce, we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by those breaches. Internet fraud has been increasing over the past few years, and the Company has experienced fraudulent use of our name and trademarks on websites in connection with the purported sale of vehicles offered on third-party websites, with payments to be handled through an online escrow service purported to be owned and operated by the Company. These fraudulent online transactions and scams, should they continue to increase in prevalence, could affect our reputation with consumers and give rise to claims by consumers for funds transferred to the fraudulent accounts, which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are insured for some, but not all, of the foregoing risks. Even for those risks for which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all costs, liabilities or losses we might incur or experience.\nTelemarketing Risks. We are subject to various federal and state laws, rules, regulations and orders regarding telemarketing and privacy, including restrictions on the use of unsolicited emails and restrictions on marketing activities conducted through the use of telephonic communications (including text messaging to mobile telephones). Our financial performance could be adversely affected by newly-adopted or amended laws, rules, regulations and orders relating to telemarketing and increased enforcement of such laws, rules, regulations or orders by governmental agencies or by private litigants. One example of regulatory changes that may affect our financial performance are the regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d). Regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission under the TCPA require the prior express written consent of the called party before a caller can initiate telemarketing calls (i) to wireless numbers (including text messaging) using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice; or (ii) to residential lines using an artificial or prerecorded voice. Failure to comply with the TCPA can result in significant penalties, including statutory damages. We may become subject to lawsuits (including class-action lawsuits) alleging that our business violated the TCPA. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations. Such litigation, even if not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and an adverse outcome could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Our efforts to comply with these regulations may negatively affect conversion rates of leads, and thus, our revenue or profitability.\nTechnology Risks\nOur business is dependent on keeping pace with advances in technology. If we are unable to keep pace with advances in technology, consumers may stop using our services and our revenues will decrease. Our financial performance may be materially and adversely impacted by material investments in technology. The internet and electronic commerce markets are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements, frequent new service and product introductions embodying new technologies, including mobile internet applications, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing websites and technology obsolete. These market characteristics are intensified by the evolving nature of the market and the fact that many companies are expected to introduce new internet products and services in the near future. If we are unable to adapt to changing technologies, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. Our performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our existing services, develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers, license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. The development of our websites, mobile applications and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our websites or other proprietary technology to customer requirements or to emerging industry standards. In addition, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected by material investments in technology in order to keep pace with technological advances.\nInterruptions or failures in our information technology platforms, communication systems or security systems could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Our information technology and communications systems are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, technology operations and development failures, failure of redundant systems and disaster recovery plans and similar events. Such outages and interruptions could damage our reputation and materially and adversely impact our financial performance. Despite our network security measures, our information technology platforms are vulnerable to computer viruses, worms, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage, insider threats and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering, as well as coordinated denial-of-service attacks. We do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services. In the event of delays or disruptions to services we rely on third-party providers to perform disaster recovery planning and services on our behalf. We are vulnerable to extended failures to the extent that planning and services are not adequate to meet our continued technology platform, communication or security systems\u2019 needs. We rely on third-party providers for our primary and secondary internet connections. Our co-location service and public cloud services that provide infrastructure and platform services, environmental and power support for our technology platforms, communication systems and security systems are received from third-party providers. We have little or no control over these third-party providers. Any disruption of the services they provide us or any failure of these third-party providers to effectively design and implement sufficient security systems or plan for increases in capacity could, in turn, cause delays or disruptions in our services. We are insured for some, but not all, of these events. Even for those events for which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all losses we might incur or experience. We have recently conducted evaluations of our technology and business systems, and based on these evaluations, we believe that our technology infrastructure, our accounting and business systems and disaster recovery procedures are in need of upgrades and replacements. Failure to implement these updates and upgrades could result in systems failures, inability to promptly recover from system failures, and data security risks. We anticipate incurring significant expenses in upgrading and replacing technology infrastructure and business systems over the next three years. Our financial performance may be materially and adversely impacted by material investments in new technology infrastructure and business systems.\nOn January 9, 2020, the Company discovered that its network was impacted by malware that encrypted servers on most systems and disrupted consumer and customer access to many of our services. In connection with this incident, third-party consultants and forensic experts have been engaged to assist with the restoration and remediation of systems and to investigate the incident. While most impacted systems are once again operational, work is ongoing to restore full system functionality as quickly as possible. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has not discovered evidence that causes the Company to conclude that there has been any unauthorized access to or acquisition of any consumer personal information or customer confidential information.\nThe Company carries insurance, including cyber and business interruption insurance. The full scope of the costs and related impacts of this incident, including the availability of insurance to offset some of these costs and related impacts of this incident, have not been fully determined. There can be no assurances that similar network security incidents can be prevented in the future.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for certain support services and should they fail to perform, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on various third parties to provide certain support services, including disaster recovery planning and services. Should a third-party fail to perform or perform adequately, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with overseas operations.\nWe currently maintain website, software development and operations in Guatemala. These overseas operations are subject to many inherent risks, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nPolitical and social instability;\n\u25cf\nExposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to labor and employment laws and intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nContinuation of overseas conflicts and the risk of terrorist attacks and resulting heightened security;\n\u25cf\nThe imposition of governmental controls and restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nTheft and other crimes;\n\u25cf\nNationalization of business and blocking of cash flows;\n\u25cf\nChanges in taxation and tariffs;\n\u25cf\nDifficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u25cf\nForeign currency exchange fluctuations.\nThese risks can significantly impact our overseas operations and outsourcing. Increases in the cost, or disruptions, of such operations and outsourcing, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we are subject to certain anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. If we or any of our employees or agents violates these laws, we could become subject to sanctions or significant penalties that could negatively affect our reputation and financial performance.\nWe may acquire other companies, and there are many risks associated with acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy we evaluate potential acquisitions that we believe will complement or enhance our existing business. We currently do not have any definitive agreements to acquire any company or business, and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous risks that include the following, any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance:\n\u25cf\nWe may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or may not realize them in the timeframe expected, including due to acquisitions where we expand into product and service offerings or enter or expand into markets in which we are not experienced;\n\u25cf\nIn order to complete acquisitions, we may issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders. Issuance of equity securities may also restrict utilization of net operating loss carryforwards because of an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations under the Internal Revenue Code;\n\u25cf\nWe may borrow to finance acquisitions, and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisition-related or other borrowings may not be favorable to the Company and could affect our liquidity and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nAcquisitions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans;\n\u25cf\nOur due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with an acquired company that may result in unexpected or increased costs, expenses or liabilities that could make an acquisition less profitable or unprofitable;\n\u25cf\nThe failure to further our strategic objectives that may require us to expend additional resources to develop products, services and technology internally;\n\u25cf\nAn announced business combination and investment transaction may not close timely or at all, which may cause our financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter; and\n\u25cf\nBusiness combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation that can be costly to defend or settle, even if no actual liability exists.\n\u25cf\nIntegrations of acquisitions are often complex, time-consuming and expensive, and if acquisitions are not successfully integrated they could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. The challenges involved with integration of acquisitions include:\no\nDiversion of management attention to assimilating the acquired business from other business operations and concerns;\no\nIntegration of management information and accounting systems of the acquired business into our systems, and the failure to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition;\no\nDifficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our own business;\no\nDifficulties in integrating management information and accounting systems of an acquired business into our current systems;\no\nConvincing our customers and suppliers and the customers and suppliers of the acquired business that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus and that they should not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers;\no\nConsolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes;\no\nPersuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale, retaining key employees and integrating employees into the Company;\no\nCoordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures; and\no\nManaging integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.\nSecurities Market Risks\nThe public market for our common stock may be volatile, especially because market prices for internet-related and technology stocks have often been unrelated to operating performance. Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cAUTO,\u201d but we cannot assure that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of the common stock will not decline. The stock market in general periodically experiences significant price fluctuations. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as:\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf\nHistorical and anticipated operating metrics such as the number of participating Dealers, volume of Lead deliveries to Dealers, the number of visitors to Company Websites and the frequency with which they interact with Company Websites;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements of new product or service offerings;\n\u25cf\nTechnological innovations;\n\u25cf\nLow trading volumes;\n\u25cf\nConcentration of holdings in our common stock resulting in low public float and trading volume for our shares;\n\u25cf\nDecisions by holders of large blocks of our stock to sell their holdings on accelerated time schedules, including by reason of their decision to liquidate investment funds that hold our stock;\n\u25cf\nLimited analyst coverage of the Company;\n\u25cf\nCompetitive developments, including actions by Manufacturers;\n\u25cf\nData or network security incidents and breaches;\n\u25cf\nLoan covenant defaults;\n\u25cf\nChanges in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates;\n\u25cf\nConditions and trends in the internet, electronic commerce and automotive industries;\n\u25cf\nAdoption of new accounting standards affecting the technology or automotive industry;\n\u25cf\nRumors, whether or not accurate, about us, our industry or possible transactions or other events;\n\u25cf\nThe impact of open market repurchases of our common stock; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral market or economic conditions and other factors.\nFurther, the stock markets, and in particular The Nasdaq Capital Market, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market factors have affected and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes, energy price changes, pandemics, international currency fluctuations, terrorist acts, political revolutions, military actions or wars, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies with publicly traded securities.\nOur common stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we are not able to satisfy continued listing requirements, in which case the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital and issue equity-based compensation may be adversely affected, and trading in our stock may be less orderly and efficient. For our common stock to continue to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the Company must satisfy various continued listing requirements established by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In the event the Company was not able to satisfy these continued listing requirements, we expect that our common stock would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. These markets are generally considered to be less efficient and less broad than The Nasdaq Capital Market. Investors may be reluctant to invest in the common stock if it is not listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market or another stock exchange. Delisting of our common stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and would also eliminate our ability to rely on the preemption of state securities registration and qualification requirements afforded by Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1933 for \u201ccovered securities.\u201d The loss of this preemption could result in higher costs associated with raising capital, could limit resale of our stock in some states, and could adversely impact our ability to issue equity-based compensation to Company employees.\nOne of the continued listing requirements is that the Company\u2019s Common Stock not trade below a minimum closing bid requirement of $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. Should the Company\u2019s Common Stock trade below the $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement for 30 business days, Nasdaq would send the Company a deficiency notice, advising the Company that it is being afforded a compliance period of 180 days to regain compliance with the requirement. This 180 day compliance period may be extended by Nasdaq for another 180 days, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, including that the Company meet other continued listing requirements and provides a written notice to Nasdaq that the Company intends to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid requirement during the extended period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nNo assurances can be given that the Company will continue to be able to meet the continued listing requirements for listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nRisks Associated with Litigation\nMisappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, enforcement actions to protect our intellectual property and claims from third parties relating to intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and technology industries. We expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Our proprietary systems and technology are a competitive factor. While we rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright law, confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights, we believe that the technical and creative skills of our personnel, continued development of our proprietary systems and technology, brand name recognition and reliable website maintenance are more essential in establishing and maintaining a leadership position and strengthening our brands. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and may be expensive. We have no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available when our products and services are made available online. In addition, if litigation becomes necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, this litigation, even if successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We also have no assurances that our products and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Claims of infringement, even if unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. If we are not successful, we may be subject to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and monetary damages which may be trebled in the case willful infringements.\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected by actions of third parties that could subject us to litigation. We could face liability for information retrieved or obtained from or transmitted over the internet by third parties and liability for products sold over the internet by third parties. We could be exposed to liability with respect to third-party information that may be accessible through our websites, links or vehicle review services. These claims might, for example, be made for defamation, negligence, patent, copyright or trademark infringement, personal injury, breach of contract, unfair competition, false advertising, invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature, content or copying of these materials. These claims might assert, among other things that, by directly or indirectly providing links to websites operated by third parties we should be liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through those websites. It is also possible that, if any third-party content provided on our websites contains errors, consumers could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on such information. Any claims could result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nWe also enter into agreements with other companies under which any revenues that results from the purchase or use of services through direct links to or from our websites or on our websites is shared. In addition, we acquire personal information and data in the form of Leads purchased from third-party websites involving consumers who submitted personally identifiable information and data to the third parties and not directly to us. These arrangements may expose us to additional legal risks and uncertainties, including disputes with these parties regarding revenue sharing, local, state and federal government regulation and potential liabilities to consumers of these services, even if we do not provide the services ourselves or have direct contact with the consumer. These liabilities can include liability for violations by these third parties of laws, rules and regulations, including those related to data security and privacy laws and regulations; unsolicited email, text messaging, telephone or wireless voice marketing; and licensing. We have no assurance that any indemnification provided to us in our agreements with these third parties, if available, will be adequate.\nOur financial performance could be materially and adversely affected by other litigation. From time to time, we are involved in litigation or legal matters not related to intellectual property rights and arising from the normal course of our business activities. The actions filed against us and other litigation or legal matters, even if not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and an adverse outcome in litigation could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. Our liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, tax benefit preservation plan and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third-party from acquiring us or limit the price third parties are willing to pay for our stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws relating to our corporate governance and provisions in our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan could make it difficult for a third-party to acquire us and could discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of the common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the Board of Directors is divided into three classes, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or change in our management because less than a majority of the Board of Directors are up for election at each annual meeting, and as a result of the classified board the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) provides that directors may only be removed for cause. In addition, provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u25cf\nRequire that actions to be taken by our stockholders may be taken only at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u25cf\nSpecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, a committee of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors or our President;\n\u25cf\nEstablish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors and other proposals to be brought before a stockholders meeting;\n\u25cf\nProvide that our bylaws may be amended by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nAllow our Board of Directors to establish the size of our Board of Directors;\n\u25cf\nProvide that vacancies on our Board of Directors or newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of our directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u25cf\nDo not give the holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors.\nThese provisions could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect corporate actions such as a merger, asset sale or other change in control of us.\nUnder our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, rights to purchase capital stock of the Company (\u201cRights\u201d) have been distributed as a dividend at the rate of five Rights for each share of common stock. Each Right entitles its holder, upon triggering of the Rights, to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company at a price of $73.00 (as this price may be adjusted under the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan) or, in certain circumstances, to instead acquire shares of common stock. The Rights will convert into a right to acquire common stock or other capital stock of the Company in certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions. The Rights will be triggered upon the acquisition of 4.90% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock or future acquisitions by any existing holders of 4.90% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. If a person or group acquires 4.90% or more of our common stock, all Rights holders, except the acquirer, will be entitled to acquire at the then exercise price of a Right that number of shares of our common stock which, at the time, has a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan authorizes our Board of Directors to exercise discretionary authority to deem a person acquiring common stock in excess of 4.90% not to be an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d under the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan, and thereby not trigger the Rights, if the Board finds that the beneficial ownership of the shares by the person acquiring the shares will not be likely to directly or indirectly limit the availability to the Company of the net operating loss carryovers and other tax attributes that the plan is intended to preserve or is otherwise in the best interests of the Company.\nWe are also subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which, in general, prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. For purposes of Section 203, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder, and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or did own 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. Section 203 could discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire control of us.\nIf our internal controls and procedures fail, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls over financial reporting are processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely affected by a failure in our internal control over financial reporting. If our financial statements are not fairly presented, investors may not have an accurate understanding of our operating results and financial condition. If our financial statements are not timely filed with the SEC, we could be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. If either or both of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and the market price of our common stock. In addition, a failure in our internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur internal controls may not prevent all potential errors or fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved. We, or our independent registered public accountants, may identify material weaknesses in our internal controls which could adversely affect our ability to ensure proper financial reporting and could affect investor confidence in us and the price of our common shares.\nIf we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract, train and retain additional highly qualified sales, marketing, managerial and technical personnel, our business may suffer.\nOur future success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly-qualified executive, sales, marketing, managerial and technical personnel. In addition, as we introduce new services we may need to hire additional personnel. We may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. The inability to attract and retain the necessary highly-qualified executive, managerial, technical, sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. Each of these executive officers could be difficult to replace. There is no guarantee that these or any of our other executive officers and key employees will remain employed with us. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nQualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive compensation packages, including cash and stock-based compensation. Our primary forms of stock-based incentive awards are stock options and restricted stock. If the anticipated value of such stock-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our stock-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened.", "PERMNO": 86763, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "AUTO"}
