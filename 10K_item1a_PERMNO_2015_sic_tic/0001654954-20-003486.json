{"cik": "1140102", "company": "HireQuest, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur common stock value and our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below. If any of these risks actually occur, our common stock, business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the value of your investment could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. These risk factors should be carefully considered together with the other information in this Form 10-K, including the risks and uncertainties described under the heading \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nFluctuations in general economic conditions, including those caused by the novel coronavirus disease (\"COVID-19\"), may significantly impact demand for our services, system-wide sales, and profitability.\nThe demand for temporary staffing is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the workforce needs of our clients, which creates uncertainty and volatility. National and global economic activity can be slowed by many factors, including the economic impact of COVID-19, fluctuating markets and interest rates and global trade uncertainties. As economic activity slows, companies tend to reduce their use of temporary workers and reduce their recruitment of new employees, and permanent full-time and part-time workers are generally inclined to work more hours and overtime, resulting in fewer available vacancies and less demand for our services. Significant declines in demand of any region or industry in which we have a major presence may severely reduce the demand for our services and thereby significantly decrease our revenue and profits. Deterioration in economic conditions or the financial or credit markets could also have an adverse impact on our clients\u2019 ability to pay for services we have already provided.\nIt is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles and the project nature of our staffing assignments. The uncertainty can be exacerbated by volatile economic conditions, which may cause clients to reduce or defer projects for which they utilize our services. The negative impact to our business can occur before a decline in economic activity is seen in the broader economy. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and investment necessary to profitably take advantage of growth opportunities.\nThe coronavirus pandemic is an emerging serious threat to health and economic wellbeing affecting our franchisees, employees, customers and the overall economy.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that infections of COVID-19 had become pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the President of the United States announced a National Emergency relating to the disease. Since March 13, several state and local authorities have taken dramatic action including, without limitation, ordering the workforce to stay home, banning all non-essential businesses from operating, refusing to issue new building permits, and invalidating current building permits causing work to stop. There has been widespread infection in the United States and abroad, with the potential for catastrophic impact on human lives, including those of our franchisees and employees, and the economy as a whole, including our customers. In addition to the actions described above, national, state, and local authorities have recommended social distancing and imposed or are considering quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population and additional mandatory business closures. These measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries, is uncertain. Some economists are predicting the United States will soon enter a recession.\nThe sweeping nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how our business operations will be affected long term. But the likely overall economic impact of the pandemic is viewed as highly negative to the general economy. Already, the COVID-19 outbreak has begun to negatively impact our operations and revenue as well as those of our franchisees. We expect the effects to become more acute in the next few months. It is possible that a number of our offices may be forced to close. To date, our franchisees have closed or consolidated a small number of offices at least, in part, due to the potential financial impacts of COVID-19. Some of our franchisees may experience economic hardship or even failure. We may be classified as a non-essential business in some or all of the jurisdictions that impose a ban on non-essential businesses. If that were to occur, we may be forced to temporarily or permanently close offices in those jurisdictions. Our customers may choose to voluntarily close their worksites. Already, we have witnessed a significant drop in the amount of hospitality, event service, and catering business that we do. We may experience a shortage of temporary employees as a result of the spread of the disease.\nAny of the above factors, or other cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, severely negatively impact our revenue, net income, and other results of operations, reduce system-wide sales, cause office closings or cause us to lose franchisees, and impact our liquidity position, possibly significantly. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted.\nWe may be unable to attract sufficient qualified candidates to meet the needs of our clients.\nWe compete to meet our clients\u2019 needs for workforce solutions and, therefore, we must continually attract qualified candidates to fill positions. Attracting qualified candidates depends on factors such as desirability of the assignment, location, the health of our workforce, and the associated wages and other benefits. We have experienced shortages of qualified candidates and we may experience such shortages in the future due to a number of factors including, without limitation, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, if there is a shortage, the cost to employ or recruit these individuals could increase. If we are unable to pass those costs through to our clients, it could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are vulnerable to seasonal fluctuations with lower demand in the fall and winter months.\nRoyalty fees generated from office sales in markets subject to seasonal fluctuations will be less stable and may be lower than in other markets. Locating offices in highly seasonal markets involves higher risks. Individual franchisee revenue can fluctuate significantly on both a quarter over quarter and year over year basis thereby impacting our royalty and service revenue, depending on the local economic conditions and need for temporary labor services in the local economy. Weather can also have a significant impact on our operations as there is typically lower demand for staffing services during adverse weather conditions in the winter months. To the extent that seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, our royalty fees could fluctuate materially from period to period.\nWe are critically dependent on workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage at commercially reasonable terms, and unexpected changes in claim trends on our workers\u2019 compensation may negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe employ workers for whom we provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Our workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies are renewed annually. The majority of our insurance policies are with Chubb/Ace American. Our insurance carriers require us to collateralize a significant portion of our workers\u2019 compensation obligation. We currently collateralize our policies largely with a letter of credit from Branch Banking and Trust Company, now Truist Bank (\u201cBB&T\u201d). If we no longer had access to that collateral, we could not be certain we would be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies would be available on acceptable terms. As our business grows or if our financial results deteriorate, the amount of collateral required will likely increase and the timing of providing collateral could be accelerated. Resources to meet these requirements may not be available to us in a timely manner or at all. The loss of our workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage would prevent us from operating as a staffing services business in the majority of our markets. Further, we cannot be certain that our current and former insurance carriers will be able to pay claims we make under such policies.\nWe are responsible for a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation program. Unexpected changes in claim trends, including the severity and frequency of claims, changes in state laws regarding benefit levels and allowable claims, actuarial estimates, or medical cost inflation, could result in costs that are significantly higher. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any changes in claims-related liabilities.\nOur efforts to actively manage the safety of our temporary workers and actively control costs with internal staff and our network of workers\u2019 compensation related service providers may not be sufficient to prevent material increases to our workers\u2019 compensation costs.\nWe are dependent on a small number of individuals who constitute our current management.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our senior management team and other key employees at our corporate headquarters and on our franchisees\u2019 ability to recruit, retain, and motivate key employees. Competition for such employees can be intense, and the inability to attract and retain the additional qualified employees required to expand our activities, or the loss of current key employees including, without limitation, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our and our franchisees\u2019 operating efficiency and financial condition. In addition, our growth strategy may place strains on our management who may become distracted from day-to-day duties.\nOur industry is subject to extensive government regulation and the imposition of additional regulations, which could materially harm our future earnings.\nOur workforce solutions are subject to extensive government regulation. In particular, we are subject to a significant number of employment laws due to our being a large employer. Additionally, there are state and federal rules regarding disclosure requirements to potential franchisees and regulations regarding our relationship with existing franchisees. The cost to comply, and any inability to comply with government regulation, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Increases or changes in government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially harm our business.\nWe offer our qualifying temporary workers government-mandated health insurance in compliance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d). We cannot be certain that compliant insurance coverage will remain available to us on reasonable terms, and we could face additional risks arising from future changes to or repeal of the ACA or changed interpretations of our obligations under the ACA.\nRecently, Congress enacted the Families First Coronavirus Response Act which, among other things, requires certain employers under certain circumstances to pay their employees emergency paid sick leave and pay further leave under an extension of the Family Medical Leave Act. It is possible that the payments required by this law will have a significant negative impact on many of our franchisees. We cannot predict whether Congress will enact additional legislation in response to COVID-19 or whether additional legislation will impact us and our franchisees positively or negatively.\nWe may incur employment related claims or other types of claims and costs that could materially harm our business.\nWe are in the business of employing people in the workplaces of our clients. We incur a risk of liability for claims for personal injury, wage and hour violations, immigration, discrimination, harassment, and other liabilities arising from the actions of our clients and/or temporary workers. Some or all of these claims may give rise to negative publicity, litigation, settlements, or investigations. As a result, we may incur costs, charges or other material adverse impacts on our financial statements.\nWe maintain insurance with respect to some potential claims and costs with deductibles. We cannot be certain that our insurance will be available, or if available, will be of a sufficient amount or scope to cover claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our business. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, or that our insurance providers will be able to pay claims we make under such policies.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and may be unable to retain clients or market share.\nOur industry is highly competitive and rapidly innovating. We compete in national, regional and local markets with full-service and specialized temporary staffing companies. Our competitors offer a variety of flexible workforce solutions. Therefore, there is no assurance that we will be able to retain clients or market share in the future, nor can there be any assurance that we will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or maintain our current profit margins.\nIf we fail successfully to implement our growth strategy, which includes new office development by existing and new franchisees, our ability to increase our revenue and operating profits could be adversely affected.\nPortions of our growth strategy rely on new office development by existing and new franchisees. Our franchisees may face many challenges in opening new offices including:\n\u25cf\nAvailability and cost of financing;\n\u25cf\nNegotiation of acceptable lease and financing terms;\n\u25cf\nTrends in the overall and local economy of the target market;\n\u25cf\nRecruitment, training, and retention of qualified core staff and temporary personnel; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral economic and business conditions (including those resulting from the effects of the coronavirus global pandemic (COVID-19)).\nThese factors are outside of our control and could hinder our franchisees from opening new offices or expanding existing ones. This could prevent us from successfully implementing our growth strategy.\nChanges in our industry could place strains on our management, employees, information systems, and internal controls, which may adversely impact our business.\nChanges in the temporary staffing industry and how our customers utilize, order, and pay for temporary staffing services, particularly through new and innovative uses of technology, may place significant demands on our administrative, operational, financial, and other resources or require us to obtain different or additional resources. Any failure to respond to or manage such changes effectively could adversely affect our business. To be successful, we will need to continue to implement management information systems and improve our operating, administrative, financial, and accounting systems and controls in order to adapt quickly to such changes. These changes may be time-consuming and expensive, increase management responsibilities, and divert management attention, and we may not realize a return on our investment in these changes.\nThe loss of or damage to key relationships, including with Dock Square, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on its relationships with clients and collaboration partners. On July 15, 2019, the Company entered into a consulting arrangement with Dock Square HQ, LLC (\u201cDock Square\u201d), an organization with connections at many of the largest users of temporary staffing in the country. Pursuant to this consulting arrangement, Dock Square introduces prospective customers and expands relationships with existing customers of the Company in return for which it is eligible to receive unregistered shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, subject to certain performance metrics and vesting terms. The loss of or damage to the Company\u2019s consulting arrangement with Dock Square may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and revenue.\nShifts in attitudes towards contingent workforces could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAttitudes and beliefs about contingent workforces could change such that our customers no longer desire to utilize our services. If this occurs, it could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Such a shift could also make it challenging or impossible for us to successfully implement our growth strategies.\nDifficult political or market conditions, natural disasters, global pandemics, or other unpredictable matters could affect our business in many ways including by reducing the amount of available temporary employees, reducing the amount of customer projects, or harming the overall economy which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur business is linked to conditions in the overall economy, such as those impacting the ability of our customers to obtain financing, the availability of temporary employees, changes in laws, and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and pandemics. In particular, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 could materially affect our business to the extent it affects the economy overall, negatively impacts the industries our customers are in, or infects a large number of temporary employees removing them from the available worker pool. These factors are unpredictable and outside of our control. They may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and value of investments, including investments in our common stock.\nOur credit facility contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOn July 11, 2019, in connection with the Merger, we, along with our subsidiaries, entered into a loan agreement with BB&T for a $30 million line of credit with a $15 million sublimit for letters of credit. The loan agreement and other loan documents contain customary events of default and negative covenants, including but not limited to those governing indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates, and sales of assets. The loan agreement also requires us to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.10:1.00.\nThe agreements limit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25cf\nSell, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u25cf\nUndergo a change in control;\n\u25cf\nConsolidate and merge with other entities; or\n\u25cf\nCreate, incur, or assume liens, debt, and other encumbrances.\nThe operating and other restrictions and covenants in the agreements and in any future financing arrangement that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in certain business activities, or expand or fully pursue our business strategies, or otherwise limit our discretion to manage our business. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those restrictions and covenants. A breach of any of the restrictions and covenants could result in a default under our agreements which could cause any outstanding indebtedness under the agreements or under any future financing arrangements to become immediately due and payable, and result in the termination of commitments to extend further credit.\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nBorrowings under our credit facility bear interest at rates determined using LIBOR as the reference rate. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase-out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or if alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted, and currently it appears highly likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or substantially modified by 2021. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks. Furthermore, we may need to renegotiate our revolving credit facility or incur other indebtedness, and changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the use of an alternative rate or benchmark, may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Franchisees and Business Model\nConverting our company-owned offices to franchises has multiple risks.\nWe believe that the franchise model is superior to the company-owned store model. To that end, we converted the remaining company-owned offices to franchises in the third quarter of 2019. However, we will have less control over the day-to-day operations of the offices and the franchisees may operate in a manner that is counter to our interests or introduce risks to our business by departing from our operating norms. Further, franchises are generally regulated at both the federal and the state level, so operating as franchises will introduce additional regulatory risk. In addition, the new franchisees will need to adapt to a new operating model, a new IT system, and new business processes.\nOur operating and financial results and growth strategies are closely tied to the success of our franchisees.\nWith all of our offices being operated by franchisees, we are dependent on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees. We have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run, and the inability of franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating and financial results through decreased royalty payments or otherwise. If our franchisees incur too much debt, if their operating expenses increase, or if economic or sales trends deteriorate (including as a result of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19) such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt, it could result in their financial distress, including insolvency or bankruptcy. If a significant franchisee or a significant number of franchisees become financially distressed, our operating and financial results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments. A franchisee bankruptcy could have a substantial negative impact on our ability to collect payments due under such franchisee\u2019s franchise agreement. Our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our franchisees to be incentivized to deliver excellent customer service, resolve any issues efficiently, and ensure customer retention. In addition, our success depends on the willingness and ability of our franchisees to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment. Our franchisees may be unable to successfully implement strategies that we believe are necessary for their further growth, which in turn may harm our growth prospects and financial condition.\nOur franchisees could take action that could harm our business.\nOur franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their offices in accordance with the operations standards set forth in our agreements with them and applicable laws. However, although we attempt to properly train and support all our franchisees, they are independent third parties whom we do not control. The franchisees own, operate, and oversee the daily operations of their offices, and their core office employees are not our employees. While we have the ability to enforce our franchise agreements, many of our franchisees\u2019 actions are outside of our control. Although we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective franchisees, we cannot be certain that our franchisees will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to operate successful franchises at their approved locations, and state franchise laws may limit our ability to terminate or not renew these franchise agreements. Moreover, despite our training, support, and monitoring, franchisees may not successfully operate offices in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and adequately train qualified office personnel. The failure of our franchisees to operate their franchises in accordance with our standards or applicable law, actions taken by their employees or a negative publicity event at one of our franchisees\u2019 offices or involving one of our franchisees could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our brands, our ability to attract prospective franchisees, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIf we fail to identify, recruit, and contract with a sufficient number of qualified franchisees, our ability to open new offices and increase our revenue could be materially adversely affected.\nThe opening of additional offices and expansion into new markets depends, in part, upon the availability of prospective franchisees who meet our selection criteria. Many of our franchisees open and operate multiple offices, and part of our growth strategy requires us to identify, recruit and contract with new franchisees or rely on our existing franchisees to expand. We may not be able to identify, recruit or contract with suitable franchisees in our target markets on a timely basis or at all. If we are unable to recruit suitable franchisees or if franchisees are unable or unwilling to open new offices, our growth may be slower than anticipated, which could materially adversely affect our ability to increase our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOpening new offices in existing markets and aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales and may negatively affect sales at existing offices.\nWe intend to continue opening new franchised offices in our existing markets as a part of our growth strategy. Expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Further, the customer target area of our offices varies by location, depending on a number of factors, including population density, area demographics and geography. As a result, the opening of a new office in or near markets in which our franchisees\u2019 offices already exist could adversely affect the sales of these existing franchised offices. Sales cannibalization between offices may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could affect sales growth, which could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets.\nA large number of our franchises are controlled by a small number of individuals.\nA significant number of our franchises are controlled or beneficially owned by a small number of individuals. Specifically, the offices we sold and converted to franchises on September 27, 2019 are controlled by a single individual via several affiliated entities. In addition, the franchisees we refer to as the \"Worlds Franchisees\" share significant common ownership with one another and with us. If either of these ownership groups, or any of our other relatively large ownership groups, were to experience financial difficulty, reduced sales volume, or close, we may experience a negative impact on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition.\nOur results of operations may be significantly affected by the ability of certain franchisees to repay their loans to us.\nLending money to our franchisees for startup costs and short-term funding is an essential part of our business. While most of our franchisees have historically repaid their loans to us, for various reasons, a small number have not, and there is no guarantee that our franchisees will continue to repay their loans in the future. The risk of non-payment is affected, among other things, by:\n\u25cf\nThe overall condition and results of operations of the particular franchise;\n\u25cf\nChanges in economic conditions that impact specific franchisees, our industry, or the overall economy;\n\u25cf\nThe amount and duration of the loan;\n\u25cf\nCredit risks of a particular borrower; and\n\u25cf\nIn terms of collateral, the value of the franchised business and any individual guarantee we have or have not obtained.\nOur franchisees\u2019 ability to repay their loans usually depends upon their successful operation of their business and income stream. Loans we extend to franchisees to finance their purchase of a new branch typically are our largest and riskiest loans; however, given their historical role in driving growth in our overall size and revenue streams, we intend to continue those lending efforts. At December 31, 2019, our loans receivable from franchisees and from the party to whom we sold the California offices constituted 24.2% of our assets. We extended for us unprecedented levels of purchase financing loans in 2019 in connection with the Merger and subsequent sales and conversions of company-owned offices to franchises. If our franchisees do not repay these loans, it may negatively impact our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have improperly balanced the costs and benefits related to our Franchise Expansion Incentive Program.\nThrough our Franchise Expansion Incentive Program, we have agreed, under certain circumstances, to provide certain franchisees with credits to their royalty fees, financing assistance, or acquisition funding. If the new offices which are funded in whole or in part by this program fail or underperform, we may suffer financially, and it may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition.\nWe may have improperly balanced the costs and benefits related to our Risk Management Incentive Program.\nThrough our Risk Management Incentive Program, we have agreed, under certain circumstances, to provide certain payments to our franchisees. The program is designed to incentivize our franchisees to achieve certain loss ratio thresholds for workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If more franchisees than anticipated achieved these thresholds, or franchisees significantly exceeded our expectations with respect the workers\u2019 compensation claims history, we may be required to pay more than we have anticipated pursuant to our Risk Management Incentive Program which may negatively impact our results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition.\nWe may engage in litigation with our franchisees.\nAlthough we believe we generally enjoy a positive working relationship with our franchisees, the nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship may give rise to litigation with our franchisees. While we do not engage in litigation with our franchisees in the ordinary course of business, it is possible that we may experience litigation with some of our franchisees in the future. We may engage in future litigation with franchisees to enforce our contractual indemnification rights if we are brought into a matter involving a third party due to the franchisee\u2019s alleged acts or omissions. In addition, we may be subject to claims by our franchisees relating to our franchise disclosure document, including claims based on financial information contained in our franchise disclosure document. Engaging in such litigation may be costly and time-consuming and may distract management and materially adversely affect our relationships with franchisees and our ability to attract new franchisees. Any negative outcome of these or any other claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations as well as our ability to expand our franchise system and may damage our reputation and brands. Furthermore, existing and future franchise-related legislation could subject us to additional litigation risk in the event we terminate or fail to renew a franchise relationship.\nRisks Related to the Merger and Our Organizational Structure\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Legacy HQ with Command Center. To realize the anticipated benefits, the combined company must successfully integrate the businesses. This integration has been, and will continue to be, complex and time-consuming.\nPotential difficulties we may encounter include, among others:\n\u25cf\nUnanticipated issues in integrating logistics, information, communications, and other systems;\n\u25cf\nIntegrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing a consistent, high quality level of service;\n\u25cf\nUnanticipated issues resulting from the completion of the transition of our owned-office network to franchised operations owned by multiple franchisees, including first-time business owners;\n\u25cf\nIntegrating complex systems, technology, networks, and other assets of the two companies in a seamless manner to minimize disruption to customers, employees, service providers, and other constituencies;\n\u25cf\nPerformance shortfalls as a result of diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations matters to integration matters;\n\u25cf\nPotential unknown liabilities, liabilities that are significantly larger than anticipated, unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Merger and the integration process;\n\u25cf\nUnanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\nThe impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including, without limitation, any problems that arise as a result of integrating the accounting systems of a public and a private company; and\n\u25cf\nUnanticipated complexities associated with managing the larger, combined business.\nThese factors could contribute to us not fully achieving the anticipated benefits of the Merger, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are a \u201cpersonal holding company,\u201d we may be required to pay personal holding company taxes, which would have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition.\nUnder the Code, a corporation that is a \u201cpersonal holding company\u201d may be required to pay a personal holding company tax in addition to regular income taxes. A corporation generally is considered a personal holding company if (1) at any time during the last half of the taxable year more than 50% of the value of the corporation\u2019s outstanding stock is owned, directly, indirectly, or constructively, by or for five or fewer individuals, the Ownership Test, and (2) at least 60% of the corporation\u2019s \u201cadjusted ordinary gross income\u201d constitutes \u201cpersonal holding company income\", the Income Test. A corporation that is considered a personal holding company is required to pay a personal holding company tax at a rate equal to 20% of such corporation\u2019s undistributed personal holding company income, which is generally taxable income with certain adjustments, including a deduction for U.S. federal income taxes and dividends paid.\nWe will likely satisfy the Ownership Test for the 2019 tax year. However, we do not expect to satisfy the Income Test in 2019. Accordingly, we do not believe that we will be considered a personal holding company for the 2019 tax year. However, because personal holding company status is determined annually and is based on the nature of the corporation\u2019s income and percentage of the corporation\u2019s outstanding stock that is owned, directly, indirectly, or constructively, by major stockholders, there can be no assurance that we will not be a personal holding company for the 2019 tax year or become a personal holding company in any future taxable year. If we were considered a personal holding company with undistributed personal holding company income in a taxable year, the payment of personal holding company taxes would have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our common stock, as well as lead to a loss of investor confidence in us.\nAs described under Item 9A. \"Controls and Procedures\" below, management has concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2019 and, accordingly, internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe are taking steps to remediate this material weakness. While we believe these steps will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the identified deficiency, if our remediation efforts are insufficient to address the material weakness or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to record, process, summarize and report information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and to otherwise comply with our reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and our credit agreement will likely be adversely affected. The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, the material weakness and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements and have other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our business, including an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, potential actions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, possible defaults under our credit agreement, shareholder lawsuits, a loss of investor confidence and damage to our reputation.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq market. We expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs over prior years and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We are unable to currently estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We also expect that, as a public company, it will be more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage or to accept reduced policy limits and coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nRisks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity\nAdvances in technology may disrupt the labor and recruiting markets.\nWe expect the increased use of internet-based and mobile technology will attract additional technology-oriented companies and resources to the staffing industry. We face increasing competition from \u201cgig-economy\u201d companies entering the temporary staffing industry by providing apps to connect workers with employers. Such competition could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our candidates and clients increasingly demand technological innovation to improve the access to and delivery of our services.\nOur clients increasingly rely on automation, artificial intelligence and other new technologies to reduce their dependence on labor needs, which may reduce demand for our services and impact our operations. Our franchisees face extensive pressure for lower prices and new service offerings and we must continue to invest in and implement new technology and industry developments to remain relevant to our ultimate clients and candidates. If we are unable to do so, our business and results of operations may decline materially. Furthermore, if our clients are able to increase the effectiveness of their internal staffing and recruitment functions through analytics, automation or otherwise, their need for the services our franchisees offer may decline. New technology and more sophisticated staffing management and recruitment processes may cause clients to outsource less of their staffing management, reducing the demand for our franchisees services.\nOur information technology systems may need to be updated or replaced.\nWe occasionally implement, modify, retire and change our systems. These changes to our information technology systems may be disruptive, take longer than desired, be more expensive than anticipated, be distracting to management, or fail, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially.\nThe improper disclosure of, or access to, our confidential and/or proprietary information, or a failure to adequately protect this information, could materially harm our business.\nOur business requires the use, processing, and storage of confidential information about applicants, candidates, temporary workers, other employees and clients. We occasionally experience cyberattacks, computer viruses, social engineering schemes and other means of unauthorized access to our systems. The security controls over sensitive or confidential information and other practices we and our third-party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. We may fail to implement practices and procedures that comply with increasing privacy regulations. Failure to protect the integrity and security of such confidential and/or proprietary information could expose us to regulatory fines, litigation, contractual liability, damage to our reputation and increased compliance costs.\nOur facilities, operations, and information technology systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption.\nOur primary computer systems, headquarters, support facilities and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, employee errors, security breaches, natural disasters and catastrophic events. Failure of our systems or damage to our facilities may cause significant interruption to our business, and require significant additional capital and management resources to resolve, causing material harm to our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nOur directors, officers, and current principal stockholders own a large percentage of our common stock and could limit other stockholders\u2019 influence over corporate decisions.\nAs of March 27, 2020, our directors, officers, and current stockholders holding more than 5% of our common stock collectively beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate, approximately 65% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Hermanns beneficially owns approximately 43% of our outstanding common stock, and Mr. Jackson beneficially owns approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders acting alone or together may be capable of controlling most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, approval of acquisitions, approval of equity incentive plans, and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other stockholders, and they may act in a manner with which some stockholders may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of all stockholders.\nOur stock typically trades in low volumes daily which could lead to illiquidity, volatility, or depressed stock price.\nBecause of a history of low trading volume, our stock may be relatively illiquid and its price may be volatile. Our stock trades on the Nasdaq stock exchange, but typically trades in low daily volumes. For example, the average daily trading volume in our common stock on Nasdaq during the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately 7,500 shares per day. This may make it more difficult for our stockholders to resell shares when desired or at attractive prices. Some investors view low-volume stocks as unduly speculative and therefore not appropriate candidates for investment. Also, due to the low volume of shares traded on any trading day, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence prices of our stock.\nWe currently do not have any analysts covering our stock which could negatively impact both the stock price and trading volume of our stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock will likely be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not currently have, and may never obtain, research coverage by financial analysts. If no or few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock may not increase. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluation of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Furthermore, if our operating results fail to meet analysts\u2019 expectations our stock price would likely decline.\nOur stock price could be extremely volatile, and, as a result, stockholders may not be able to resell shares at or above their purchase price.\nIn the last 52 weeks, our stock price, as reported by Nasdaq, has ranged from a low of $3.85 to a high of $8.55. In addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has been highly volatile. The effects of the recent global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak could exacerbate this volatility. As a result, the market price and trading volume of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our results of operations or prospects, and could lose part or all of their investment. The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including those described elsewhere in this report and others such as:\n\u25cf\nVariations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf\nPublication of research reports by securities analysts about us, our competitors, or our industry;\n\u25cf\nThe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nOur failure, or the failure of our competitors, to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n\u25cf\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nStrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, or changes in business strategy;\n\u25cf\nThe passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;\n\u25cf\nSpeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf\nChanges in accounting principles;\n\u25cf\nTerrorist acts, acts of war, or periods of widespread civil unrest;\n\u25cf\nNatural disasters or calamities (including, without limitation, pandemics or other widespread events);\n\u25cf\nBreach or improper handling of data or cybersecurity events; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors (including currently unknown factors) which could result in changes in general market and economic conditions.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business and adversely affect our business.\nBecause we do not currently pay any cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and do not currently pay any cash dividends on our common stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Securities Act, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Section 229.10(f)(1) of the Securities Act, as amended, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies including, among other things, reduced financial disclosure requirements including being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important. We could remain a smaller reporting company indefinitely. As a smaller reporting company, investors may deem our stock less attractive and, as a result, there may be less active trading of our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.", "PERMNO": 17875, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "HQI"}
