You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, business prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below. Also, please read \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nMarket conditions for oil, natural gas and NGLs are highly volatile. A sustained decline in prices for these commodities could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.\nPrices for oil, natural gas and NGLs fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions and the occurrence of natural disasters;\n\u00b7\noverall domestic and global economic conditions;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic conditions in oil, natural gas and NGL producing countries globally, including terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war;\n\u00b7\nactions of OPEC and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u00b7\nthe effect of increasing liquefied natural gas and exports from the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy supply and energy consumption;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations, including regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells, and taxation;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts and alternative fuel requirements;\n\u00b7\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of oil, natural gas and NGL pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of refining capacity; and\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of, and consumer demand for, alternative fuels.\nGovernmental actions may also affect oil, natural gas and NGL prices. It is uncertain what impact the election of President Trump and the new Congress may have on the exploration for and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. In the past, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. Beginning in the latter half of 2014, oil prices declined precipitously, and continued to decline throughout 2015 as well as the start of 2016. The West Texas Intermediate posted price used to calculate the full cost ceiling in accordance with SEC rules declined from an annual high of $105.34 per Boe on July 1, 2014 to $69.00 per Boe on December 1, 2014, $41.85 per Boe on December 1, 2015 and $31.62 per Boe on February 1, 2016. Such volatility has negatively affected the amount of our net estimated proved reserves and has negatively affected the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our net estimated proved reserves. We recorded a full cost ceiling test impairment after income taxes of $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and we recorded a full cost ceiling impairment test impairment after income taxes of $1,365 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The impact of lower commodity prices adversely affecting proved reserve values primarily contributed to the ceiling impairment. Changes in production rates, prices, levels of reserves, future development costs, transfers of unevaluated properties, and other factors will determine our actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analyses in future periods. The 12-month average commodity price could continue to decline, which could result in additional impairments being recorded during 2017.\nIn addition, our revenue, profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, and continued price volatility and low commodity prices, or a sustained drop in prices could negatively affect our financial results and impede our growth. In particular, sustained declines in commodity prices will:\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to enter into commodity derivative contracts at attractive prices;\n\u00b7\nreduce the value and quantities of our reserves, because declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices would reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can economically produce;\n\u00b7\nreduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital; and\n\u00b7\nmake it uneconomical for our operating partners to commence or continue production levels of oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nAn increase in the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe prices that we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGL production sometimes reflect differences between the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a basis differential. Increases in the basis differential between the benchmark prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not have or currently plan to have any commodity derivative contracts covering the amount of the basis differentials we experience in respect of our production. As such, we will be exposed to any increase in such differentials, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of February 27, 2017, we had commodity derivative contracts in place covering approximately 36% and 98% of the mid-point of our estimated oil and natural gas production, respectively, for 2017. The contracts consist of swaps and put spreads covering crude oil and natural gas production. In the future, we expect to continue to enter into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our estimated production, which could result in net gains or losses on commodity derivatives. Our hedging strategy and future hedging transactions will be determined by our management,\nwhich is not under any obligation to enter into commodity derivative contracts covering any specific portion of our production.\nThe prices at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts covering our production in the future will be dependent upon oil, natural gas and NGL prices at the time we enter into these transactions, which may be substantially higher or lower than past or current oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Accordingly, our price hedging strategy may not protect us from significant declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices realized for our future production. Conversely, our hedging strategy may limit our ability to realize incremental cash flows from commodity price increases. As such, our hedging strategy may not protect us from changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices that could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLower oil, natural gas and NGL prices have caused us to record ceiling limitation impairments, reducing our earnings and our stockholders\u2019 equity and further declines in commodity prices may cause us to record further impairments, which would reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe use the full-cost method of accounting and accordingly, we capitalize all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil, natural gas and NGL properties, including unproved and unevaluated property costs. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized cost of oil, natural gas and NGL properties may not exceed a \u201cceiling limit\u201d that is based upon the present value of estimated future net revenues from net proved reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of the cost or fair market value of unproved properties and other adjustments as required by SEC rules. If net capitalized costs of oil, natural gas and NGL properties exceed the ceiling limit, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken. This is called a \u201cceiling limitation impairment.\u201d The risk that we will experience a ceiling limitation impairment increases when oil, natural gas or NGL prices are depressed as in the current environment, if we have substantial downward revisions in estimated net proved reserves or if estimates of future development costs increase significantly. Based upon current price trends we could experience ceiling limitation impairments in future periods.\nBeginning in the latter half of 2014, oil prices declined precipitously, and continued to decline throughout 2015 as well as the start of 2016. Given this decline in commodity prices, the net book value of our oil and natural gas properties exceeded our ceiling amount using the WTI unweighted 12-month average price adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price realized at the wellhead, resulting in a total write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties of $1,365 million after income taxes during 2015 and $169.0 million after income taxes during 2016. As ceiling test computations depend upon the calculated unweighted arithmetic average prices, it is difficult to predict the likelihood, timing and magnitude of any future impairments. However, a decline in 12-month average commodity prices could result in additional impairments recorded during 2017. A ceiling test write down would negatively affect our results of operations.\nCosts associated with unevaluated properties are not initially subject to the ceiling test limitation. Rather, we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value based upon our intentions, as approved by our board of directors and management, with respect to drilling on such properties, the remaining lease term, geological and geophysical evaluations, drilling results, the assignment of proved reserves, and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. These factors are significantly influenced by our expectations regarding future commodity prices, development costs, and access to capital at acceptable cost. During any period in which these factors indicate impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization and the ceiling test limitation. Accordingly, a significant change in these factors, many of which are beyond our control, may shift a significant amount of cost from unevaluated properties into the full cost pool that is subject to amortization and the ceiling test limitation.\nLower oil and natural gas prices also reduces the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial and sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices would render uneconomic a significant portion of our development and exploitation projects. This may result in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, substantial and sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially\nand adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nThe Company\u2019s derivative risk management activities could result in financial losses.\nTo mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company\u2019s net cash provided by operating activities, support the Company\u2019s annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects, the Company\u2019s strategy is to enter into derivative arrangements covering a portion of its oil, NGL and natural gas production. These derivative arrangements are subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment, and the changes in fair market value of the contracts are reported in the Company\u2019s statements of operations each quarter, which may result in significant non-cash gains or losses. After the current hedges expire, there is significant uncertainty that we will be able to put new hedges in place that will provide us with the same benefit. These derivative contracts may also expose the Company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:\n\u00b7\nproduction is less than the contracted derivative volumes, in which case we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our hedging obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity;\n\u00b7\nthe counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u00b7\nthere is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge instrument; or\n\u00b7\nthe derivative contracts limit the benefit the Company would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices.\nSuch financial losses could materially impact our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the Comanche Acquisition will be consummated in the anticipated timeframe, on the terms described herein, or at all.\nOn January 12, 2017, the Company, through two of our subsidiaries, SN EF UnSub, LP (\u201cSN UnSub\u201d) and SN EF Maverick, LLC (\u201cSN Maverick\u201d), along with an entity controlled by The Blackstone Group, L.P., Gavilan Resources, LLC (\u201cBlackstone\u201d), signed a purchase and sale agreement (the \u201cComanche Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire assets (the \u201cComanche Assets\u201d) from Anadarko E&P Onshore LLC and Kerr-McGee Oil and Gas Onshore LP (together, \u201cAnadarko\u201d) for $2,275 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments (the \u201cComanche Acquisition\u201d). The consummation of the Comanche Acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including conditions that must be met by Anadarko and that are beyond our control. In addition, under certain circumstances, we, Blackstone or Anadarko are able to terminate the Comanche Purchase Agreement. In addition, we may be required to seek or utilize additional or other financing sources to consummate the Comanche Acquisition, if we do not have sufficient liquidity at closing or if our anticipated financing sources, including the preferred unit investment by affiliates of GSO Capital Partners LP (individually or collectively, as the context requires, \u201cGSO\u201d) in SN UnSub or the credit facility to be entered into by SN UnSub at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, are not available, and we cannot assure you that such additional or other financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. There can be no assurances that the Comanche Acquisition will be consummated in the anticipated timeframe, on the terms described herein, or at all.\nIf the Comanche Acquisition is not consummated, under certain circumstances, we may be required to forfeit our approximate $56.9 million deposit under the Comanche Purchase Agreement. Furthermore, our stock price could be negatively impacted if we fail to complete the Comanche Acquisition.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the Comanche Acquisition. There can be no assurance that events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the Comanche Acquisition. In addition, we, Blackstone and Anadarko have the ability to terminate the Comanche Purchase Agreement under certain circumstances. Failure to complete the Comanche Acquisition would prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the Comanche Acquisition. We would also remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees. In addition, the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether the Comanche Acquisition will be completed. Consequently, the failure to complete or any delay in the closing of the Comanche Acquisition could result in a significant change in the market price of our common stock.\nThe Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake involve risks associated with acquisitions and integration of acquired assets, and the intended benefits of the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake may not be realized.\nThe Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake involve risks associated with acquisitions and integrating acquired assets into existing operations, including that:\n\u00b7\nour senior management's attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations of Catarina and our other legacy assets to the integration of the assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition;\n\u00b7\nwe could incur significant unknown and contingent liabilities for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to achieve the economies of scale that we expect from integrating the Comanche Assets or any other assets we may acquire into our existing operations;\n\u00b7\nthe assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake may not perform as well as we anticipate; and\n\u00b7\nunexpected costs, delays and challenges may arise in integrating the assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake into our existing operations.\nEven if we successfully integrate the assets acquired in the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake into our operations, it may not be possible to realize the full benefits we anticipate or we may not realize these benefits within the expected timeframe. If we fail to realize the benefits we anticipate from the Comanche Acquisition or any other acquisition we may undertake, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the lease with respect to the Catarina assets and under the terms of the Comanche Development Agreement, we are subject to annual drilling and development requirements and failure to comply with these requirements may result in loss of our interests in the Catarina area that are not held by production or sizable default payments to Anadarko, respectively.\nIn order to protect our exploration and development rights in the Catarina area, we are required to drill 50 wells per year (measured from July 1 to June 30). If we fail to meet the minimum drilling commitment under the terms of the Catarina Lease, we could forfeit our acreage under the Catarina Lease and rights to develop land not held by production (excluding, in certain instances, associated rights such as midstream assets). If we drill more than 50 wells in a prescribed twelve month period, we may apply such additional wells (up to a maximum of 30 additional wells) toward the following prescribed twelve month period\u2019s 50-well requirements. In addition, the Catarina Lease requires us to go no longer than 120 days without spudding a well, and, under the terms of the Catarina Lease, failure to do so could result in the forfeiture of our acreage under the Catarina Lease and rights to develop land not held by production (excluding, in certain instances, acreage upon which associated midstream assets are located). Our drilling plans for our undeveloped leasehold acreage are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs,\navailability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we cannot assure you that we will be able meet our obligations under the Catarina Lease. If the Catarina Lease expires, we will lose our right to develop the related properties on this acreage, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAt the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we will enter into a development agreement (the \u201cDevelopment Agreement\u201d) with Anadarko pursuant to which we will commit to completing and equipping 60 wells per year for 5 years. If we complete and equip more than 60 wells in a year, we may apply such additional wells (up to a maximum of 30 additional wells) toward the following years\u2019 60-well requirements. If we fail to complete and equip the required number of wells in a given year (after applying any qualifying additional wells from previous years), we must pay Anadarko a default fee of $200,000 for each well we fail to timely complete and equip. The drilling plan is subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we cannot assure you that we will be able meet our obligations under the Development Agreement following the closing of the Comanche Acquisition.\nOur agreements with Blackstone and GSO will restrict us from transferring our right, title and interest to the Comanche Assets.\nAt the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we will enter into a joint development agreement with Blackstone (the \u201cJDA\u201d) that provides for the administration, operation and transfer of the jointly-owned Comanche Assets. Under the terms of the JDA, except under limited circumstances, neither we nor Blackstone can transfer any of our rights, title or interest to any asset or related assets (including any working interests) prior to the third anniversary of the JDA. In addition, under our agreements with GSO, following the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we will not be able to dispose of all or a substantial portion of the Comanche Assets without GSO\u2019s consent. These restrictions may prohibit us from taking advantage of certain opportunities, including our ability to sell these assets, which may arise from time to time.\nThe JDA will contain right of first offer (\u201cROFO\u201d) and tag-along provisions that may hinder our ability to sell our interest in the Comanche Assets within our desired time frame or on our desired terms, and could delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nUnder the terms of the JDA, both parties have a ROFO in the event that the other party intends to sell or otherwise transfer its interests. In addition, the JDA provides both parties with a tag-along right in the event that the other party intends to sell at least 35% of its total interests to a third-party purchaser (including upon a change of control transaction involving us). These features could limit third-party offers, inhibit our ability to sell our interests or adversely affect the timing of any sale of our interests and our ability to obtain the highest price possible in the event that we decide to market or sell our interests. In addition, the tag-along provisions of the JDA may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders or a third party to replace or remove our current management or to acquire an interest in or engage in other corporate transactions with us, by subjecting certain corporate change of control transactions to a tag-along provision pursuant to which a third party may be required to acquire Blackstone\u2019s interest in the Comanche Assets if it desires to enter into a corporate transaction with us.\nUpon closing the Comanche Acquisition, we will enter into the JDA with Blackstone and amend and restate the limited partnership agreement of one of our subsidiaries, SN UnSub and the limited liability company agreement of SN UnSub\u2019s general partner, SN EF UnSub GP, LLC, to admit GSO as a limited partner and member, respectively, therein, which involves risk.\nAt the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Comanche Acquisition, we will enter into the JDA that provides for the administration, operation and transfer of the jointly-owned Comanche Assets. The JDA provides for the parties to establish an operating committee, which will control the timing, scope and budgeting of operations on the Comanche Assets (subject to certain exceptions). Although we will be designated as operator of the Comanche Assets\nunder the JDA, under certain circumstances we may be removed as operator and, furthermore, because we will not control the operating committee we will not have unilateral control over many key variables of the operation and development of the Comanche Assets, including the establishment of the budget and development plan for the Comanche Assets. There can be no assurance that Blackstone will continue its relationship with us in the future or that we will be able to pursue our stated strategies with respect to the Comanche Assets. Furthermore, Blackstone may (a) have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; (b) take actions contrary to our policies or objectives; (c) undergo a change of control; (d) experience financial and other difficulties; or (e) be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the JDA, which may affect our financial conditions or results of operations.\nUnder the amended and restated limited partnership agreement of SN UnSub and limited liability company agreement of SN UnSub\u2019s general partner, we will not be able to cause SN UnSub or its general partner to take or not to take certain actions unless GSO consents. GSO has committed to make a substantial investment (including contributions and other commitments) in SN UnSub at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition and, accordingly, has required that the relevant organizational documents of SN UnSub and its general partner contain certain features designed to provide it with the opportunity to participate in the management of SN UnSub and its general partner and to protect its investment in SN UnSub, as well as any other assets which may be substantially dependent on or otherwise affected by the activities of SN UnSub. These participation and protective features include a governance structure that consists of a board of directors of SN UnSub\u2019s general partner, only some of whom are appointed by us. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nIn addition, at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we expect that SN UnSub, which is an \u201cunrestricted subsidiary\u201d (as further described in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Note 5. Long Term Debt\u201d), will have entered into a $330 million senior secured reserve-based revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Citibank, N.A. and certain of their affiliates (the \u201cSN UnSub Credit Facility\u201d) or other alternate \u201cstand alone\u201d financing arrangement, which will limit its freedom to take certain actions. Thus, without the concurrence of GSO and/or the lenders under the SN UnSub Credit Facility or other financing arrangements, we will not be able to cause SN UnSub and its general partner to take or not to take certain actions, even though those actions may be in the best interest of SN UnSub, its general partner, or us. Furthermore, we, SN UnSub\u2019s lenders, GSO and Blackstone may have different or conflicting goals or interests which could make it more difficult or time-consuming to obtain any necessary approvals or consents to pursue activities that we believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur estimated reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and future production. It is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs in an exact way. Oil, natural gas and NGL reserve engineering is complex, requiring subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, future production levels and operating and development costs. In estimating our level of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, we and our independent reserve engineers make certain assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, including assumptions relating to:\n\u00b7\nthe level of oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u00b7\nfuture production levels;\n\u00b7\ncapital expenditures;\n\u00b7\noperating and development costs;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of regulation;\n\u00b7\nthe accuracy and reliability of the underlying engineering and geologic data; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of funds.\nIf these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our estimates of our reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our estimated reserves could change significantly. For example, with other factors held constant, if the commodity prices used in our reserve report as of December 31, 2016 had decreased by 10%, then the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves as of that date would have decreased by approximately $216.7 million, from approximately $513.4 million to approximately $296.7 million.\nOur standardized measure is calculated using unhedged oil, natural gas and NGL prices and is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates to take into account changes in our assumptions and the results of actual development and production.\nThe reserve estimates we make for wells or fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for wells or fields with lengthy production histories. A lack of production history may contribute to inaccuracy in our estimates of proved reserves, future production rates and the timing of development expenditures.\nOur estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves will naturally decline over time, and we may be unable to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, production volumes, and cash flow depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. Our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves will naturally decline over time as they are produced. Our success depends on our ability to economically develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our own current and future production. If we are unable to do so, or if expected development is delayed, reduced or cancelled, the average decline rates will likely increase.\nThe pro forma financial statements for the Comanche Acquisition and Carrizo Disposition are presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations following the Comanche Acquisition or the Carrizo Disposition.\nThe pro forma financial statements for the Comanche Acquisition and Carrizo Disposition included in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed January 31, 2017 and January 9, 2017, respectively, are presented for illustrative purposes only, are based on various adjustments and assumptions, many of which are preliminary, and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations following the Comanche Acquisition or the Carrizo Disposition. Our actual financial condition and results of operations following the Comanche Acquisition may not be consistent with, or evident from, these pro forma financial statements and other statements relating to the Comanche Acquisition or the Carrizo Disposition. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial data and estimates may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following the Comanche Acquisition or the Carrizo Disposition. Therefore, investors should refer to our historical financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our common stock.\nDeveloping and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are costly and high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of developing, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Additionally, drilling wells with no or sub-economic levels of oil, natural gas and NGL production (dry holes) will negatively impact our financial position. In addition, our use of 2D and 3D seismic data and visualization techniques to identify subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators do not enable the interpreter to\nknow whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures and requires additional pre-development expenditures. Furthermore, our development and production operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u00b7\nhigh costs, shortages or delivery delays of rigs, equipment, labor or other services;\n\u00b7\ncomposition of sour gas, including sulfur and mercaptan content;\n\u00b7\nunexpected operational events and conditions;\n\u00b7\nreductions in oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u00b7\nincreases in severance taxes;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nfacility or equipment malfunctions and equipment failures or accidents, including acceleration of deterioration of our facilities and equipment due to the highly corrosive nature of sour gas;\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\npipe or cement failures, casing collapses or other downhole failures;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with ever-changing environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil, natural gas and NGL spills, salt water spills, pipeline ruptures, discharges of toxic gases or other releases of hazardous substances;\n\u00b7\nlost or damaged oilfield development and service tools;\n\u00b7\nunusual or unexpected geological formations and pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u00b7\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u00b7\nfires, blowouts, surface craterings and explosions;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, NGL or well fluids;\n\u00b7\nloss of leases due to incorrect payment of royalties;\n\u00b7\nlimited availability of financing at acceptable rates; and\n\u00b7\nother hazards, including those associated with sour gas such as an accidental discharge of hydrogen sulfide gas, that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.\nIf any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field, or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion operations. Hydraulic fracturing has recently become subject to increased public scrutiny and recent changes in federal and state law, as well as proposed legislative changes, could significantly restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing. Such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from dense subsurface rock formations\nand, in the event of local prohibitions against commercial production of natural gas, may preclude our ability to drill wells. In addition, such laws could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. If hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other federal agencies, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and result in permitting delays, financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements, as well as potential increases in costs. Please read \u201c-Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation-Water and Other Water Discharges and Spills.\u201d\nAdditionally, hydraulic fracturing, drilling, transportation and processing of hydrocarbons bear an inherent risk of loss of containment. Potential consequences include loss of reserves, loss of production, loss of economic value associated with the affected wellbore, contamination of soil, ground water, and surface water, as well as potential fines, penalties or damages associated with any of the foregoing consequences.\nOur acquisition, development and production operations require us to make substantial capital expenditures. Although we expect to fund our capital expenditure budget for 2017 using cash flow from operations and cash on hand, if our cash flow from operations turns out to be less than we currently expect and we are required, but are unable, to fund our remaining capital budget from other sources, such as borrowings under our credit facility and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities, our failure to obtain the funds that we need could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry in which we operate is capital intensive and we must make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the acquisition, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, ability to borrow and access to capital markets are subject to a number of variables, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nour estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce;\n\u00b7\nthe prices at which we sell our production;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our hedging strategy;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of developing, producing, and transporting our oil, natural gas and NGL assets, including costs attributable to governmental regulation and taxation;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u00b7\ninterest payments, debt service and dividend payment requirements;\n\u00b7\nprevailing economic and capital markets conditions, especially for oil and gas companies;\n\u00b7\nour financial condition; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability and willingness of banks and other lenders to lend to us.\nContinued decreases in our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of lower oil, NGL or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, will adversely impact our ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. In addition, we may be\nunable to access the capital markets for debt or equity financing. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the funds we need to fund our capital budget, we will be forced to reduce our capital expenditures, which in turn could lead to a decline in our production, revenues and our reserves, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been volatile. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2016, our stock price had a low closing price of $2.29 per share and a high closing price per share of $9.78 per share. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe price of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our exploration and development operations, and the marketing of any oil we produce;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments in the United States;\n\u00b7\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nquarterly or annual variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the industries in which we compete and issuance of new or changed securities;\n\u00b7\nanalysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u00b7\nour issuance of any additional securities;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of our company and of the industry in which we compete; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are extended.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire unless production in paying quantities is established during their primary terms or we obtain extensions of the leases. Our drilling plans for our undeveloped leasehold acreage are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as drilling results, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if our undeveloped leasehold acreage will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. If our leases expire and we do not have them held by production, we will lose our right to develop the related properties on this acreage.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 58% of our acreage was held by production. As of December 31, 2016, we have leases that were not held by production and not impaired representing 8,768 net acres (all which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2017, 15,539 net acres (all of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2018, and 105,859 net acres (94,088 of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2019 and beyond. While we anticipate that our current and future drilling plans will address the majority of our leases expiring in the Eagle Ford Shale in 2017, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future drilling activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil, NGL and natural gas prices, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, NGL or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies, which may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive with respect to acquiring prospects and properties, marketing oil, NGLs and natural gas, and securing equipment and trained personnel. Many of our competitors are large independent oil and natural gas companies that possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than those of the Sanchez Group. Those entities may be able to develop and acquire more properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Many of our larger competitors not only drill for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial, technical or personnel resources permit. In addition, there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and natural gas industry. These larger companies may have a greater ability to continue development activities during periods of low oil, NGL and natural gas prices and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. Furthermore, we may not be able to aggregate sufficient quantities of production to compete with larger companies that are able to sell greater volumes of production to intermediaries, thereby reducing the realized prices attributable to our production. Any inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.\nThere are a variety of operating risks inherent in our wells and other operating properties and facilities, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and natural disasters, all of which could cause substantial financial losses. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of our operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial revenue losses. The location of our wells and other operating properties and facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.\nInsurance against all operational risks is not available to us. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could, therefore, occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Moreover, insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms. Changes in the insurance markets due to weather, adverse economic conditions, and the aftermath of the Macondo well incident in the Gulf of Mexico have made it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would otherwise have obtained prior to these market changes,\nand we cannot be sure the insurance coverage we do obtain will not contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or cover all potential losses. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur lack of diversification increases the risk of an investment in us and we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major contiguous area.\nOur current business focus is on the oil and natural gas industry in a limited number of properties, in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and, to a lesser extent, the TMS in Southwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana. Larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversification. However, we currently lack diversification, in terms of both the nature and geographic scope of our business. For example, our Catarina assets, comprised of approximately 106,000 contiguous net acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas under the Catarina Lease (the \u201cCatarina Lease\u201d), represent approximately 90% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, approximately 33% of our Eagle Ford acreage as of December 31, 2016 and, approximately 81% of our total production volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified, increasing our risk profile. In particular, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells in which we have an interest that are caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from wells in the Eagle Ford Shale. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we own an ownership interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operations of these non-operated properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production, revenues and reserves. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe nature and timing of the operator\u2019s drilling and other activities;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of required capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s geological and engineering expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\nthe approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s selection of suitable technology.\nOur ability to produce oil and natural gas could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules.\nWater is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Drought conditions have persisted in our areas of operation in past years. These drought conditions have led governmental authorities to restrict the use of water, subject to their jurisdiction, for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations, we may be unable to economically\nproduce oil and natural gas, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, the Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and natural gas waste into navigable waters. In addition, the underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Public concerns regarding the potential impacts to groundwater and induced seismic activity have resulted in new requirements related to the underground injection and disposal of fluids. The EPA is also examining regulatory requirements for \u201cindirect dischargers\u201d of wastewater - i.e., those that send their discharges to private or publicly owned treatment facilities, which treat the wastewater before discharging it to regulated waters. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the discharge of underground injection of fluids and the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nWe may lose our rights to the Sanchez Group\u2019s technological database, including its 3D and 2D seismic data, under certain circumstances.\nPursuant to the Services Agreement, we have access to the unrestricted, proprietary portions of the technological database owned and maintained by the Sanchez Group and related to our properties, and SOG is otherwise required to interpret and use the database, to the extent relating to our properties, for our benefit under the Services Agreement. For a description of the Services Agreement see \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Note 9, Related Party Transactions\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This database includes the 2D and 3D seismic data used for our exploration and development projects as well as the well logs, LAS files, scanned well documents and other well documents and software that are necessary for our daily operations. This information is critical for the operation and expansion of our business. Under certain circumstances, including if SOG provides at least 180 days\u2019 advance written notice of its desire to terminate the Services Agreement, the license agreement will terminate and we will lose our rights to this technological database unless members of the Sanchez Group permit us to retain some or all of these rights, which they may decline to do in their sole discretion. In such event, we are unlikely to be able to obtain rights to similar information under substantially similar commercial terms or to continue our business operations as proposed and our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and it could delay or prevent an acquisition of us.\nIf we do not purchase additional acreage or make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited.\nOur ability to grow depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. We may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are:\n\u00b7\nunable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with their owners;\n\u00b7\nunable to obtain financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or\n\u00b7\noutbid by competitors.\nIf we are unable to acquire properties containing estimated proved reserves, our total level of estimated proved reserves will decline as a result of our production.\nAny acquisitions we complete or geographic expansions we undertake will be subject to substantial risks that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\nmistaken assumptions about estimated proved reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs, including synergies, timing of expected development and the potential for expiration of underlying leaseholds;\n\u00b7\nan inability to successfully integrate the assets or businesses we acquire;\n\u00b7\na decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nmistaken assumptions about the overall cost of equity or debt;\n\u00b7\nan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets;\n\u00b7\nfacts and circumstances that could give rise to significant cash and certain non-cash charges; and\n\u00b7\ncustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nFurther, we may in the future expand our operations into new geographic areas with operating conditions and a regulatory environment that may not be as familiar to us as our existing project areas. As a result, we may encounter obstacles that may cause us not to achieve the expected results of any such acquisitions, and any adverse conditions, regulations or developments related to any assets acquired in new geographic areas may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic data and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. Our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition, given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nWe adopted the Rights Plan, which though it was designed to preserve the value of our NOLs, may discourage the acquisition and sale of large blocks of our common stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.\nOn July 28, 2015, the Company entered into a net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) designed to preserve stockholder value and the value of our NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock without the approval of our board of directors. The Rights Plan may discourage existing 5% common stockholders from selling their interest in a single block, which may impact the liquidity of the Company's common stock, may deter institutional investors from investing in our common stock, and may deter potential acquirers from making premium offers to acquire the Company, factors which may depress the market price of our common stock. We can make no assurances the Rights Plan will be effective in meeting its intended objectives, including to deter a change in control and protecting or realizing NOLs.\nIf we were to experience an ownership change, we could be limited in our ability to use net operating losses arising prior to the ownership change to offset future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had NOLs of $1,200.9 million. If we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with NOLs arising prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under our credit facility and the UnSub Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1.71 billion of debt outstanding, net of premium, discount and debt issuance costs, all of which was attributable to our Senior Notes, and a borrowing base of $350 million (with an aggregate elected commitment amount of $300 million) under our credit facility for secured revolver borrowings. In connection with the Comanche Acquisition, we expect to incur additional indebtedness at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition under the UnSub Credit Facility, which is expected to be on substantially the same terms as our existing facility, conformed to current market conditions and non-recourse to our other assets. Our increased indebtedness could adversely affect our business. In particular, it could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nWe will be subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our credit facility and expect to be subject to interest rate risk with respect to the UnSub Credit Facility, which we intend to enter at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, which bears or is expected to bear in the case of the UnSub Credit Facility interest at variable rates. Interest rate changes will not affect the market value of any debt incurred under such facilities, but could affect the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. We currently do not have any interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to our existing credit facility, nor are any for any of our facilities contemplated in the future. A significant increase in prevailing interest rates that results in a substantial increase in the interest rates applicable to our indebtedness could substantially increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictive covenants may adversely affect our operations.\nOur credit facility, the indenture governing the Senior Notes contains, and we believe that the UnSub Credit Facility that we expect to enter into at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition will contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including our ability, among other things, to:\n\u00b7\nincur or assume additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u00b7\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u00b7\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u00b7\nmake loans and investments;\n\u00b7\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u00b7\nrestrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate or merge with or into another entity, or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nenter into new lines of business.\nA breach of the covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes, the covenants under our credit facility or the covenants under the UnSub Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. An event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in an acceleration of any other debt that contains a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision (however, we expect that a default under our credit facility or the Senior Notes would not result in the acceleration of or default under the UnSub Credit Facility and that a default under the UnSub Credit Facility would not result in the acceleration of or default under our credit facility or Senior Notes). In addition, an event of default under our credit facility or the UnSub Credit Facility would permit the lenders under the relevant facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our credit facility or the UnSub Credit Facility, as applicable, could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and expect to incur additional indebtedness in connection with the Comanche Acquisition, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nThe aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including the following:\n\u00b7\nany failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nthe covenants contained in our debt agreements limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u00b7\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u00b7\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u00b7\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nAfter the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we expect to have additional outstanding indebtedness under the UnSub Credit Facility, which is expected to be on substantially the same terms as our existing credit facility, conformed to current market conditions and non-recourse to our other assets. Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nBecause we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors may deem relevant. Covenants contained in our credit facility, future credit facilities we may enter into, our indenture and the certificates of designations for our preferred stock restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) permits payment of dividends only out of a corporation\u2019s surplus, which is defined as the excess of net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over a corporation\u2019s capital as determined under the DGCL. If commodity prices continue to decline, the value of our net assets will also continue to decline and, accordingly, our ability to lawfully declare and pay dividends may also decline. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common process used by oil and natural gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and natural gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from federal regulation, and thus the process is typically regulated by state agencies. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the Underground Injection Control or UIC Program. In Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider EPA guidance in these areas. In addition, the EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures.\nOn May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air\nemissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.\nFurthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells. Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, and a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. These proceedings or regulations or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from conventional or tight formations, increase our costs of compliance and doing business and make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings.\nFurther federal, state and/or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if additional federal, state and/or local laws are enacted.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations. In addition, the third parties on whom we rely on for gathering and transportation services are also subject to complex federal, state and other laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.\nOur oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation\u201d for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nIn addition, the operations of the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services are also subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations that require obtaining and maintaining numerous permits, approvals and certifications from various federal, state and local government authorities. These third parties may incur substantial costs in order to comply with existing laws and regulations. If existing laws and regulations governing such third-party services are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to their operations, these changes may affect the costs that we pay for such services. Similarly, a failure to comply with such laws and regulations by the third parties on whom we rely could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation\u201d for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the third parties on whom we rely.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nIn recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of the\nstates have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs.\nFurthermore, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016 and establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. Also, on June 29, 2016, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico announced an Action Plan to, among other things, boost clean energy, improve energy efficiency, and reduce GHG emissions. The Action Plan specifically calls for a reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. It remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 U.S. election could impact the regulation of GHG emissions at the federal and state level.\nRestrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to monitor and report GHG emissions, purchase and operate emissions control systems to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thus could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nIn addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nMoreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nWe may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of stringent and complex environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our oil and natural gas development and production operations. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including that they may (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; (iii) govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; (iv) limit or prohibit drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, seismically active areas, and other protected areas; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (vi) result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; (vii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations; and (viii) require that additional pollution controls be installed. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and\ncostly compliance or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and, in some instances, the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time.\nThere is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. Private parties, including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste control, handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Please read \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental Matters and Regulation\u201d for more information.\nDerivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe July 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, the SEC and certain federal regulators of financial institutions, or Prudential Regulators, adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.\nAlthough some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued many rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including a rule, which we refer to as the \u201cMandatory Clearing Rule,\u201d requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to it (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps, which we do not presently have), a rule, which we refer to as the \u201cEnd User Exception,\u201d establishing an \u201cend user\u201d exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, a rule, which we refer to as the \u201cMargin Rule,\u201d setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the Margin Rule for end users that are not financial end users, which exception we refer to as the \u201cNon-Financial End User Exception,\u201d and a rule, subsequently vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and remanded to the CFTC for further proceedings, imposing position limits. The CFTC proposed a new version of this rule with respect to which the comment period closed but no final rule was issued and has re-proposed a new version of such rule, which we refer to as the \u201cRe-Proposed Position Limit Rule,\u201d with respect to which the comment period is scheduled to close on February 28, 2017. The Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule provides an exemption from the position limits for swaps that constitute \u201cbona fide hedging positions\u201d within the definition of such term under the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule, subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule.\nWe qualify for the End User Exception and will utilize it if the Mandatory Clearing Rule is expanded to cover swaps in which we participate, we qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception and will not be required to post margin under the Margin Rule and limits our existing and anticipated hedging positions constitute \u201cbona fide hedging positions\u201d under the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule and we intend to do the filing, recordkeeping and reporting necessary to utilize the bona fide hedging position exemption under the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule if and when it becomes effective, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the End User Exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers, major swap participants, financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (including laws and regulations giving European Union financial authorities the power to write down amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations and/or require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts), which we refer to collectively as \u201cForeign Regulations\u201d which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated, and, to the extent that the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule is ultimately effected, such proposed rule could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. The Foreign Regulations could have similar effects. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations and Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nWe may incur more taxes and certain of our projects may become uneconomic if certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production are eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed from time to time that contains proposals to eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These proposals include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The Trump Administration has called for a comprehensive tax reform that would significantly change U.S. tax laws. It is unclear whether any of the foregoing proposals will actually be considered and enacted as part of tax reform legislation or how soon any such changes in law could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate and/or defer certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Any such change could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing the after-tax costs we incur which would in turn make it uneconomic to drill some locations if commodity prices are not sufficiently high, resulting in lower revenues and decreases in production and reserves.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our Rights Plan and Delaware law that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us. These provisions may also frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management team. Furthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits, with some exceptions,\nstockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. In addition, the Company entered into the Rights Plan on July 28, 2015. The Rights Plan is designed to preserve stockholder value and the value of our NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock without the approval of our board of directors. Although not intended for this purpose, the Rights Plan has an anti-takeover effect. For more information on possible risks associated with our rights plan, please see \u201c-We adopted the Rights Plan, which though it was designed to preserve the value of our NOLs, may discourage the acquisition and sale of large blocks of our common stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.\u201d Finally, our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. Although we believe these provisions together provide an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer to acquire us may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks.\nWe, including our officers and directors, are involved in various legal proceedings from time to time. Certain of these legal proceedings may be a significant distraction to management and could expose our Company to significant liability, including damages, fines, penalties and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe discuss the risks and uncertainties related to our litigation in more detail below in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d and in \u201cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nWe may have potential business conflicts of interest with members of the Sanchez Group regarding our past, ongoing and future relationships and the resolution of these conflicts may not be favorable to us.\nConflicts of interest may arise between members of the Sanchez Group and us in a number of areas relating to our past, ongoing and future relationships, including:\n\u00b7\nlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising under agreements with SOG;\n\u00b7\nemployee recruiting and retention;\n\u00b7\nbusiness opportunities that may be attractive to both members of the Sanchez Group and us; and\n\u00b7\nbusiness transactions that we enter into with members of the Sanchez Group.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nFinally, in connection with our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d), we entered into several agreements with members of the Sanchez Group. In addition, at the closing of the Comanche Acquisition, we expect to enter into management services agreements with SOG for it to perform various management service functions for SN UnSub and Blackstone and/or their affiliates. These agreements were or will be made in the context of a related party transaction. The terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties.\nPursuant to the terms of our restated certificate of incorporation, members of the Sanchez Group are not required to offer corporate opportunities to us, and our directors and officers may be permitted to offer certain corporate opportunities to members of the Sanchez Group before us.\nOur board of directors includes persons who are also directors and/or officers of members of the Sanchez Group. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that:\n\u00b7\nmembers of the Sanchez Group are free to compete with us in any activity or line of business;\n\u00b7\nwe do not have any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity, transaction, or other matter in which members of the Sanchez Group engage or seek to engage merely because we engage in the same or similar lines of business;\n\u00b7\nto the fullest extent permitted by law, members of the Sanchez Group will have no duty to communicate their knowledge of, or offer, any potential business opportunity, transaction, or other matter to us, and members of the Sanchez Group are free to pursue or acquire such business opportunity, transaction, or other matter for themselves or direct the business opportunity, transaction, or other matter to its affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nif any director or officer of any member of the Sanchez Group who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction, or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that business opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that business opportunity to such member of the Sanchez Group and that director or officer will not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to have (1) breached or acted in a manner inconsistent with or opposed to his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the business opportunity or (2) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests or those of our stockholders.\nWe depend on SOG to provide us with certain services for our business. The services that SOG provides to us may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and we may have difficulty finding replacement services or be required to pay increased costs to replace these services after our agreements with SOG expire.\nCertain services required by us for the operation of our business, including general and administrative services, geological, geophysical and reserve engineering, lease and land administration, marketing, accounting, operational services, information technology services, compliance, insurance maintenance and management of outside professionals, are provided by SOG pursuant to the Services Agreement. The services provided under the Services Agreement commenced on the date that the IPO closed and will terminate five years thereafter. The term automatically extends for additional 12-month periods and is terminable by either party at any time upon 180 days\u2019 written notice. See \u201cCorporate Governance-Compensation Committee\u201d in the proxy statement for the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, which is incorporated by reference to this report. While these services are being provided to us by SOG, our operational flexibility to modify or implement changes with respect to such services or the amounts we pay for them is limited. After the expiration or termination of this agreement, we may not be able to replace these services or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to those that we will receive from SOG under our agreements with SOG.\nIn addition, SOG may outsource some or all of these services to third parties, and a failure of all or part of SOG\u2019s relationships with its outsourcing providers could lead to delays in or interruptions of these services. Our reliance on SOG and others as service providers and on SOG\u2019s outsourcing relationships, and our limited ability to control certain costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSector cost inflation could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nOur industry is cyclical and third party oilfield materials, service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. During periods of decreasing levels of industry exploration and production, such as occurred in 2015 and 2016, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services decreases. Conversely, during periods of increasing levels of industry activity, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs and oilfield services increases.\nIn the second half of 2016, we witnessed a modest improvement in commodity prices. If this trend continues, and if the commodity price recovery is robust, we expect industry exploration and production activities to increase, resulting in higher demand for oilfield services and supplies, which could result in sector price inflation. In addition, the costs of such items could increase and their availability may become limited, particularly in basins of relatively higher activity.\nA portion of our total outstanding shares is held by members of the Sanchez Group and may be sold into the market at any time. In addition, if the Comanche Acquisition is consummated, Blackstone and GSO (or their affiliates) will receive a substantial number of our securities. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of February 7, 2017, members of the Sanchez Group owned, in the aggregate, approximately 15.0% of our outstanding common stock. There are also an additional 8,961,750 shares available for future issuance to our directors, officers and employees as restricted stock or stock option awards pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan. These shares are eligible for resale in the public markets, subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In addition, at the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Comanche Acquisition, we will issue 1.5 million shares of common stock to GSO and warrants to purchase 2.0 million and 6.5 million shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, to GSO and an affiliate of Blackstone, respectively, resulting in GSO and such Blackstone affiliate owning approximately 3.9% and 7.3% of our common stock, respectively, assuming that the warrants will be fully exercised at closing. Following the conclusion of a two-year lockup period, these shares will be eligible for resale in the public markets, subject to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. In addition, under certain circumstances, members of the Sanchez Group, GSO and such Blackstone affiliate have the right to require us to register the resale of their shares. Moreover, we have registered all of the shares of our common stock that we may issue under our employee benefit plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance unless, pursuant to their terms, these stock awards have transfer restrictions attached to them. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13139, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SNECQ"}
