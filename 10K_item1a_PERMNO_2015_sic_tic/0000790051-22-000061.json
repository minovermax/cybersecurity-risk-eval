Risk Factors.\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors including those material factors set forth below, those set forth in our \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d disclosure in Item 7 and those set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results and make an investment in the Company speculative or risky.\nStrategic, Business and Operational Risks\nThe Company\u2019s earnings growth strategy is partially dependent on the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses.\nThe Company has a history of acquiring businesses as part of its earnings growth strategy. Typically, the Company considers acquiring companies that can be integrated within an existing business. Acquisitions of this type involve numerous risks, which may include a failure to realize expected revenue growth and operating and cost synergies from integration initiatives, increasing dependency on the markets served by the combined businesses or increased debt to finance the acquisitions.\nThe Company also considers the acquisition of businesses that may operate independent of existing businesses. Acquisitions of this type involve risks similar to those encountered when acquiring companies that can be integrated within an existing business, including a failure to realize expected revenue growth or operating and cost reductions within the acquired business, and could increase the possibility of diverting corporate management\u2019s attention from its existing operations.\nThe successful realization of revenue growth, cost reductions and synergies with our existing businesses, and within acquired stand-alone businesses, and increases in profitability overall, are dependent upon successful integration initiatives. If these integration initiatives are not fully realized, there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSee Note 3 for recent acquisition information.\nThe loss of, a significant decline in business with, or pricing pressure from, one or more of the Company\u2019s key customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company operates in several niche markets in which a large portion of the segment\u2019s revenues are attributable to a few large customers. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Overview-Description of Businesses by Segment\u201d for a discussion of customer concentrations by segment. A significant reduction in purchases by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of one or more of the Company\u2019s segments.\nSome of the Company\u2019s key customers enjoy significant purchasing power that may be used to exert pricing pressure on the Company. Additionally, as many of the Company\u2019s businesses are part of a long supply chain to the ultimate consumer, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected if one or more key customers elects to in-source or find alternative suppliers for the production of a product or products that the Company currently provides.\nFailure to successfully complete dispositions or restructuring activities could negatively affect the Company.\nFrom time to time, the Company, as part of its commitment to concentrate on its core business, may dispose of all or a portion of certain businesses. Such dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management's attention from the Company\u2019s core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on the Company\u2019s earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s cash flows and/or the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategy.\nAdditionally, from time to time, the Company may undertake consolidation and other restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline its operations. Such restructuring activities may divert management's attention from the Company\u2019s core businesses, increase expenses on a short-term basis and lead to potential disputes with the employees, customers or suppliers of the affected businesses. If restructuring activities are not completed in a timely manner or if anticipated cost savings, synergies and efficiencies are not realized, there may be a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRefer to Notes 4 and 8 for a discussion of disposition and restructuring matters.\nIndustry and Macroeconomic Risks\nSeveral of the market segments that the Company serves are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and global economic conditions.\nSeveral of the market segments in which the Company sells its products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and may experience periodic downturns in demand. For example, the CCM segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial construction industry, particularly in the construction repair and replacement sectors, the CIT segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial aerospace industry and the CFT segment is susceptible to downturns in the automotive industry.\nUncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its customers, distributors and suppliers. Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, commercial and residential construction, passenger airline travel, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Company\u2019s customers, distributors and suppliers, and therefore, the Company\u2019s results of operations, margins and orders. The Company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide economic conditions will fluctuate. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company's control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal, and business factors.\nThe Company operates in global markets. Approximately 16% of the Company\u2019s revenues in 2021 were generated outside the United States. In addition, to compete globally, all of the Company\u2019s segments have manufacturing\nfacilities outside the United States. In 2021, approximately 27% of cost of goods sold was derived from facilities outside of the United States.\nThe Company\u2019s reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, including import and export tariffs; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international labor, materials and shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies.\nThe Company has significant concentrations in the domestic commercial construction market.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of the Company\u2019s revenues and approximately 121% of its operating income were generated by the CCM segment. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. A decline in the commercial construction market, particularly in construction repair and replacement activities, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials.\nThe CCM segment competes through pricing, among other factors. Competition in this segment may increase pricing pressure on the Company which may negatively affect operating results in future periods.\nRaw material costs are a significant component of the Company\u2019s cost structure and are subject to volatility, including cost increases, significant disruptions to the Company's supply chains or significant shortages of materials.\nThe Company utilizes petroleum-based products, steel and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 78% of the Company\u2019s cost of goods sold in 2021. Significant increases in the costs of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and significant disruption to the Company's supply chains or significant shortages of materials could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements, including import and export tariffs and global economic conditions. Refer to \u201cPart II-Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional information regarding commodity price risk.\nCurrency fluctuation could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s reported results of business operations.\nThe Company\u2019s global revenues and other activities are translated into U.S. Dollars (\"USD\") for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the USD could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into USD. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies (primarily the USD, Euro, Chinese Renminbi and British Pound) expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to those functional currencies. Increased strength of the functional currency will decrease the Company\u2019s reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent the Company is unable or determines not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the functional currency could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products. Many of the Company\u2019s sales that are exported by its USD functional subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in USD, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the USD may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 products that are sold in USD within foreign locations.\nThe Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations. See \u201cPart II-Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for a discussion on foreign currency exchange risk.\nEnvironmental, Regulatory and Legal Risks\nThe Company and certain of its customers\u2019 operations are subject to regulatory risks.\nCertain products manufactured by our businesses and certain of our customers operating in the aerospace and medical markets are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA and EASA, and FDA, respectively. It can be costly and time-consuming for the Company and our customers to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and certifications to operate in these markets. Delays in FAA or EASA approvals or certifications of the products of our aerospace customers may impact the requirements for our interconnect components. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted for new medical devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Continued government scrutiny, including reviews of the FDA medical device pre-market authorization and post-market surveillance processes, may impact the requirements for our medical device components. Failure of the Company or any of its customers operating in these markets to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, chemical and hazardous waste management, and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners\u2019 or operators\u2019 releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment of, and compliance with, environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health, and safety requirements have not been material, and the Company did not have any significant accruals related to potential future costs of environmental remediation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, nor are any material asset retirement obligations recorded as of that date. However, the nature of the Company\u2019s operations and its long history of industrial activities at certain of its current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities or asset retirement obligations.\nChanges in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to GHG emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in the Company\u2019s products or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including GHG emissions, could subject the Company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs and other compliance requirements which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations, and financial position.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company is subject to risks arising from global pandemics, including COVID-19.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses operate in market segments currently being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating during a global pandemic exposes the Company to a number of risks, including diminished demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products, suspensions in the operations of our manufacturing facilities, maintenance of appropriate labor levels and our ability to ship products to our customers, interruptions in our supply chains and distribution systems, increases in operating costs related to pay and benefits for our employees, collection of trade receivables in accordance with their terms, potential impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets; any of which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have experienced, and could continue to experience, diminished demand for our products as a result of COVID-19. The decline in domestic and international passenger airline travel caused by COVID-19 is negatively impacting demand for our products sold to customers operating in the commercial aerospace industry. While these COVID-19 related impacts have not to date, in the aggregate, had a material adverse impact on the Company, we are unable to predict the extent or duration of these impacts as they will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration of the coronavirus outbreak, the timing and extent of increased passenger airline travel and nonresidential construction and construction repair and replacement activity, and the continued ability of our businesses to continue to operate within all applicable COVID-19 related government rules and regulations.\nSecurity breaches or significant disruptions of our information technology systems or violations of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support critical business processes. Security breaches of these systems could result in the unauthorized or inappropriate access to confidential information or personal data entrusted to us by our business partners. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, security breaches to our information technology systems, none of them to date has had a material impact on the Company. Additionally, these systems may be disrupted as a result of attacks by computer hackers or viruses, human error or wrongdoing, operational failures or other catastrophic events. The Company leverages its internal information technology infrastructures, and those of its business partners, to enable, sustain and protect its global business interests, however, any of the aforementioned breaches or disruptions could result in legal claims, liability or penalties under privacy laws or damage to operations or to the Company's reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of business. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to privacy and security requirements, we may suffer regulatory consequences that could be costly or otherwise adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 27334, "SIC": 2950, "TIC": "CSL"}
