RISK FACTORS\nA wide range of factors could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or the value of our common stock and outstanding debt securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:\nEconomic Risks and Current Events\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and will likely continue to negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nOn March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to the pandemic, governments around the world implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, work-from-home orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact our workforce and operations, the behaviors of our advertising customers and of consumers, and the operations of our suppliers. Our business, along with the global economy, has been adversely affected by these measures, which have resulted in significant reductions in time spent out of home by consumers, reductions in advertising and consumer spending, volatile economic conditions and business disruptions across markets globally.\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by COVID-19 largely due to customers deferring buying decisions and reducing marketing spend, and, due to the continued global spread of COVID-19, we anticipate continued adverse effects on our results of operations throughout our business. Additionally, we recognized $150.4 million of impairment charges during 2020 due to a reduction in projected cash flows primarily related to COVID-19. Although it was announced in December 2020 that several COVID-19 vaccines had been authorized by certain national regulatory authorities, and vaccines are being administered, the duration and severity of the effects of the pandemic continue to evolve and remain unknown. We have experienced and are continuing to experience significantly reduced advertising spend, which has and could continue to materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods and could result in future impairments.\nAdditionally, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. The extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot easily be predicted, including the re-imposition of government restrictions and mandates in various countries, actions of individuals including mask coverage and social distancing, the rate of vaccine rollout, and other actions taken throughout the world, including in our markets, to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. The severity, magnitude and duration of COVID-19 is uncertain, rapidly changing, hard to predict and depends on events beyond our knowledge or control. As such, we might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which may be material.\nOur results have been in the past, and could continue to be, adversely affected by economic uncertainty or deteriorations in economic conditions.\nWe derive revenues from the sale of advertising. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Periods of a slowing economy or recession, or periods of economic uncertainty, may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 resulted in a decline in advertising and marketing by our customers, which resulted in a decline in advertising revenues across our businesses. This reduction in advertising revenues had an adverse effect on our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global recession, which has adversely impacted our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Continued disruption to the global economy and economic uncertainty as a result of COVID-19 is likely to continue to negatively affect our advertising customers, and in turn, continue to negatively affect us. It is unclear when an economic recovery could start and what a recovery will look like as countries emerge from this unprecedented shutdown of the global economy.\nFurthermore, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate revenues in specific markets is directly affected by local and regional conditions, and unfavorable regional economic conditions also may adversely impact our results. In addition, even in the absence of a downturn in general economic conditions, an individual business sector or market may experience a downturn, causing it to reduce its advertising expenditures, which also may adversely impact our results.\nLiquidity, Financing and Capital Structure Risks\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our debt obligations and to fund our operations and capital expenditures, which depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to service our debt obligations requires a significant amount of cash. During 2020, we spent $323.8 million of cash to pay interest on our debt, and we anticipate having approximately $361.5 million of cash interest payment obligations in 2021. Our significant interest payment obligations reduce our financial flexibility, make us more vulnerable to changes in operating performance and economic downturns generally, reduce our liquidity over time, and could negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur other primary uses of liquidity are for our working capital used to fund the operations of the business and for capital expenditures related to display construction, renovation and maintenance. Our primary sources of liquidity are currently cash on hand, cash flow from operations and our credit facilities. Our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other obligations depends on our future operating performance, cash from operations and our ability to manage our liquidity, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Availability of our credit facilities for working capital and other needs is limited by certain covenants under our existing indebtedness, and if we are unable to generate sufficient cash through our operations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to meet our obligations and the value of our company. Additionally, the increased economic and demand uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which may potentially result in an increased cost of capital and an adverse impact on access to capital.\nThe purchase price of possible acquisitions, capital expenditures for deployment of digital billboards and other strategic initiatives could require additional indebtedness or equity financing from banks or other lenders, or through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity, strategic relationships or other arrangements, or from a combination of these sources. Additional indebtedness could increase our leverage and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures. The terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from securing financing on terms that are available to us at that time or at all. Further, there can be no assurance that financing alternatives will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future due to market conditions, our financial condition, our liquidity constraints or other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and even if financing alternatives are available to us, we may not find them suitable or at reasonable interest rates. The inability to obtain additional financing in such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and on our ability to meet our obligations or pursue strategic initiatives.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our substantial indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $5.6 billion of total indebtedness outstanding, including approximately $2.0 billion of term loans under the Term Loan Facility, which amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount of $20.0 million, with the balance being payable in August 2026; $130.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, which matures in August 2024; $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the \"CCOH Senior Secured Notes\"); $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \u201cCCIBV Senior Secured Notes\u201d); approximately $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 9.25% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \"CCWH Senior Notes\"); and approximately $6.8 million of other debt. Our substantial level of indebtedness and other financial obligations increase the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal, interest or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness.\nThis substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations could have negative consequences for us, including, without limitation:\n\u2022Requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing cash available for other purposes, including to fund operations and capital expenditures, invest in new technology and pursue other business opportunities;\n\u2022Limiting our liquidity and operational flexibility and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022Limiting our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n\u2022Requiring us to defer planned capital expenditures, reduce discretionary spending, sell assets, restructure existing indebtedness or defer acquisitions or other strategic opportunities, including our ability to enter into new agreements that will require capital expenditures;\n\u2022Limiting our ability to refinance any of the indebtedness or increasing the cost of any such refinancing;\n\u2022Making us more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating performance, a decline in general economic or industry conditions, or a disruption in the credit markets; and\n\u2022Making us more susceptible to negative changes in credit ratings, which could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nIf compliance with debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions, we may lose market share, our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, economic and other factors beyond our control.\n\u2022We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, and if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or refinance our indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to take any of these actions, or these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Furthermore, these actions may not be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements.\n\u2022Our ability to refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates, increasing our debt service obligations, and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance our debt at all, or we may not be successful in utilizing debt refinancings to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Furthermore, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from pursuing this alternative.\nAny failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness, and, as a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOperational Risks\nWe face intense competition in the out-of-home advertising business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current advertising revenues. We compete for advertising revenue with other out-of-home advertising businesses, as well as with other media, such as radio, newspapers, magazines, television, direct mail, mobile devices, satellite radio and Internet-based services, within their respective markets. Market shares are subject to change for various reasons including through consolidation of our competitors through processes such as mergers and acquisitions, which could have the effect of reducing our revenue in a specific market. Our competitors may develop technology, services or advertising media that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It also is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share in any of our business segments. The advertiser/agency ecosystem is diverse and dynamic, with advertiser/agency relationships subject to change. This could have an adverse effect on us if an advertiser client shifts its relationship to an agency with whom we do not have as good a relationship. An increased level of competition for advertising dollars may lead to lower advertising rates as we attempt to retain customers or may cause us to lose customers to our competitors who offer lower rates that we are unable or unwilling to match.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities, transit authorities and private landlords, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms.\nOur street furniture and transit products businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and transit authorities. Many of these contracts, which require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal, typically have terms ranging up to 15 years and have revenue-share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy, and substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids. Our competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide municipalities with different or greater capabilities, prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not been, and most likely in the future we will not be, awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, be able to renew existing contracts (on the same or better terms, or at all) or be able to replace any revenues lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts may also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity.\nThis competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022We may expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;\n\u2022We may be unable to estimate accurately the revenue derived from and the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win or anticipate changes in the operating environment on which our financial proposal was based; and\n\u2022We may encounter expenses and delays if our competitors challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.\nOur inability to successfully negotiate, renew or complete these contracts due to third-party or governmental demands and delay and the highly competitive bidding processes for these contracts could affect our ability to offer these products to our clients, or to offer them to our clients at rates that are competitive to other forms of advertising, without adversely affecting our financial results.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by many factors beyond our control.\nCertain other factors that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, decreasing overall revenues, the numbers of advertising customers, advertising fees or profit margins include but are not limited to:\n\u2022Our inability to successfully adopt or our being late in adopting technological changes and innovations that offer more attractive advertising alternatives than what we offer, which could result in a loss of advertising customers or lower advertising rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance;\n\u2022Unfavorable shifts in population and other demographics, which may cause us to lose advertising customers as people migrate to markets where we have a smaller presence or which may cause advertisers to be willing to pay less in advertising fees if the general population shifts into a less desirable age or geographical demographic from an advertising perspective;\n\u2022Unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers; and\n\u2022Unfavorable changes in labor conditions, which may impair our ability to operate or require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees.\nTechnology Risks\nRegulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy and data protection, or any failure to comply with these regulations, could hinder our operations.\nWe obtain certain types of information from users of our technology platforms, including, without limitation, our websites, web pages, interactive features, social media pages and mobile applications (collectively, \u201cPlatforms\u201d) in accordance with cookie regulation and our terms of use, with applicable Privacy Notices posted on each Platform. In addition, we obtain anonymous and aggregated audience behavior insights about consumers from vetted third-party data providers who are contractually obligated to ensure that any personal information collected is only from consenting consumers and is compliant with applicable laws. We also collect PII from our employees, users of our public bike services, our business partners and consumers who interact with our digital panels, including through QR codes and beacon technology, as set out in relevant Privacy Notices. We use and share this information from and about consumers, business partners and advertisers for a variety of business purposes.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things, including the GDPR (E.U.), effective as of May 2018, and the CCPA, which became effective in January 2020. Many of these laws are still evolving, new laws may be enacted, and any of these laws could be amended or interpreted by the courts or regulators in ways that could harm our business. For example, the state of California recently adopted the CPRA ballot initiative to expand and modify the CCPA, creating a broader set of consumer privacy rights and business obligations, which will go into full effect in 2023. Any efforts required to comply with these laws may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. In addition, changes in consumer expectations and demands regarding privacy and data protection could restrict our ability to collect, use, disclose and derive economic value from demographic and other information related to our consumers, business partners and advertisers. Such restrictions could limit our ability to offer tailored advertising opportunities to our business partners and advertisers.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements related to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy could result in a loss of confidence in us; damage to our brands; the loss of users of our services, consumers, business partners and advertisers; and proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could hinder our operations and adversely affect our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, we could lose valuable information, suffer disruptions to our business, and incur expenses and liabilities, including damages to our relationships with customers and business partners.\nWe regularly review and implement commercially reasonable organizational and technical security measures that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of our websites, digital assets and proprietary business information, as well as PII of our employees, customers, consumers and business partners. Although we have implemented physical and electronic security measures, no security measures are perfect and impenetrable, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. A security breach could occur due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or a combination of these or other actions. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could lose competitively-sensitive business information or suffer disruptions to our business operations, information processes or internal controls. In addition, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or services could be harmed, and we could lose customers, consumers and business partners. In the event of a security breach, we could suffer financial exposure in connection with penalties, remediation efforts, investigations and legal proceedings, and changes in our security and system protection measures. Additionally, most states in the U.S. and most other countries have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their PII, and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. We have experienced security breaches; however, to date, they have not had a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRegulatory Risks\nGovernment regulation of out-of-home advertising may restrict our out-of-home advertising operations.\nU.S. federal, state and local regulations have a significant impact on the out-of-home advertising industry and our business. One of the seminal laws is the HBA, which regulates out-of-home advertising on controlled roads in the U.S. The HBA regulates the size and placement of billboards, requires the development of state standards, mandates state compliance programs, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs, and requires just compensation for takings on controlled roads. Construction, repair, maintenance, upgrade, lighting, height, size, spacing, placement and permitting of billboards are also regulated by federal, state and local governments, and, from time to time, states and municipalities have prohibited or significantly limited the construction of new out-of-home advertising structures. Due to such regulations, it has become increasingly difficult to develop new out-of-home advertising locations.\nInternational regulation of the out-of-home advertising industry varies by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations limit the subject matter, animation and language of out-of-home displays. Our failure to comply with these or any future regulations could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our displays or their attractiveness to clients as an advertising medium. As a result, we may experience a significant impact on our operations, revenue, international client base and overall financial condition.\nAs we have introduced, and intend to expand, the deployment of digital billboards that display digital advertising copy from various advertisers that changes several times per minute, we have encountered regulations that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays. Since digital billboards have been developed and introduced relatively recently into the market on a large scale, existing regulations that currently do not apply to them by their terms could be revised or new regulations could be enacted to impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety. Any new restrictions on digital billboards could have a material adverse effect on both our existing inventory of digital billboards and our plans to expand our digital deployment.\nFrom time to time, certain state and local governments and third parties have attempted to force the removal of our displays under various state and local laws, including zoning ordinances, permit enforcement and condemnation. Similar risks also arise in certain of our international jurisdictions.\n\u2022There is a U.S. federal and state requirement that an owner remove any non-grandfathered, non-compliant signs along the controlled roads at the owner\u2019s expense and without compensation, and in some instances we have had to remove billboards as a result of such reviews.\n\u2022Certain zoning ordinances provide for amortization, which is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law.\n\u2022In the past, state governments have purchased and removed existing lawful billboards for beautification purposes using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and these jurisdictions may continue to do so in the future. Thus far, we have been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for, or relocation of, our billboards purchased or removed as a result of these types of governmental action, but there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.\nAdditionally, from time to time third parties or local governments assert that we own or operate displays that either are not properly permitted or otherwise are not in strict compliance with applicable law. If we are increasingly unable to resolve such allegations or obtain acceptable arrangements in circumstances in which our displays are subject to removal, modification or amortization, or if there is an increase in such regulations or their enforcement, our operating results could suffer.\nA number of state and local governments have implemented or initiated taxes, fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. From time to time, legislation also has been introduced in international jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from out-of-home advertising, for the right to use out-of-home advertising assets or for the privilege of engaging in the out-of-home advertising business. Several jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of our out-of-home advertising revenue generated in that jurisdiction or based on the size of the billboard and type of display technology. In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations using various valuation methodologies. We expect U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes as a way of increasing revenue. The increased imposition of these measures, and our inability to overcome any such measures, could adversely affect our operating income if we are unable to pass on the cost of these items to our customers.\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting out-of-home advertising, or changes in the interpretation of those laws and regulations, at any level of government, including in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could have a significant financial impact on us by requiring us to make significant expenditures to ensure compliance or otherwise limiting or restricting some of our operations.\nRestrictions on out-of-home advertising of certain products may restrict the categories of clients that can advertise using our products.\nOut-of-court settlements between the major U.S. tobacco companies and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories include a ban on the out-of-home advertising of tobacco products. Other products and services may be targeted in the U.S. in the future, including alcohol products. Most E.U. countries, among other nations, also have banned outdoor advertisements for tobacco products and regulate alcohol advertising. Regulations vary across the countries in which we conduct business. For example, localized restrictions on the location of advertising for High Fat, Salt and Sugar foods have been implemented in the U.K. Any significant reduction in advertising of products due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in our direct revenues from such advertisements and an increase in available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the out-of-home advertising industry.\nEnvironmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations may limit or restrict some of our operations.\nAs the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, we must comply with various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances; employee health and safety; and zoning restrictions. Historically, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, additional laws that may be passed in the future, or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws, could require us to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict some of our operations.\nStrategic Risks\nWe face risks arising from our restructuring activities.\nIn September 2020, we committed to a restructuring plan for our international division to reduce headcount in Europe and Latin America, partly in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our international business and the advertising industry in those regions generally, and we also committed to a separate plan to reduce headcount in our Americas segment. We also undertake other restructuring initiatives with the intention of reducing costs from time to time. The process of restructuring entails, among other activities, reducing the level of staff, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management.\nRestructurings could adversely affect us. We may experience a decrease in employee morale and delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the restructurings, such as the delay we experienced for the Europe portion of our plan during the fourth quarter of 2020. These risks are further complicated in international jurisdictions, where different legal and regulatory requirements govern the extent and speed of our ability to reduce our workforce. In addition, we may be unable to meet our business objectives due to the effects of the restructuring, and we may fail to achieve the expected cost savings of our restructuring plans and initiatives.\nFuture dispositions, acquisitions and other strategic transactions could pose risks.\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to pursue strategic dispositions of certain businesses, as well as acquisitions, and we may pursue other strategic transactions, including recapitalization or other corporate restructurings, including a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) conversion. These dispositions or acquisitions could be material. Such transactions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022Our dispositions may negatively impact revenues from our national, regional and other sales networks or make it difficult to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements, including our debt service requirements;\n\u2022Our acquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows, and we may enter into markets and geographic areas where we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022To successfully manage our large portfolio of out-of-home advertising and other businesses, we may need to recruit additional senior management as we cannot be assured that senior management of acquired businesses will continue to work for us, and we cannot be certain that our recruiting efforts will succeed;\n\u2022We may need to expand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those of acquired businesses as failure to do so may cause us to lose the benefits of any expansion that we decide to undertake by leading to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or by distracting our management, and we may encounter difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and\n\u2022Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.\nDispositions and acquisitions of out-of-home advertising businesses may require antitrust review by U.S. federal antitrust agencies and may require review by foreign antitrust agencies under the antitrust laws of foreign jurisdictions. We can give no assurances that the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), the Federal Trade Commission or foreign antitrust agencies will not seek to bar us from disposing of or acquiring out-of-home advertising businesses or impose stringent undertakings on our business as a condition to the completion of an acquisition in any market where we already have a significant position.\nLitigation Risks\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThird parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us will grow. Any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel. In the event that any third-party claims that we infringe their patents or that we are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and initiates litigation against us, even if we believe such claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability or priority. An adverse outcome of a dispute may damage our reputation, force us to adjust our business practices, require us to pay significant damages and/or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, with the potential for our competitors to gain access to the same intellectual property. In addition, the rights that we secure under intellectual property licenses may not include rights to all of the intellectual property owned or controlled by the licensor, and the scope of the licenses granted to us may not include rights covering all of the products, services and technologies provided by us. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nClaims that our suppliers infringe on the intellectual property rights of others could cause disruptions in our supply chain.\nOur suppliers have received, and in the future may receive, claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in disruptions to our supply chain. If our suppliers are not successful in defending allegations of infringement, they could be required to redesign their product offerings and could be prevented from manufacturing the products supplied to us in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. A reduction or interruption in our suppliers\u2019 production, an increase in our supply purchasing costs derived from reduced competition or otherwise, or an inability to secure alternative sources of supply on substantially the terms and conditions currently available to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nInternational Business Risks\nDoing business in foreign countries exposes us to certain risks not expected to occur when doing business in the U.S.\nDoing business in foreign countries carries with it certain risks that are not found when doing business in the U.S. These risks could result in losses against which we are not insured. Examples of these risks include the potential instability of foreign governments, potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the U.S., changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation or application of laws or regulations, new or increased tariffs or unfavorable changes in trade policy, government policies against businesses owned by foreigners, risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities, difficulties collecting receivables and otherwise enforcing contracts with governmental agencies and others in some foreign legal systems, investment restrictions or requirements, expropriations of property without adequate compensation, withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries, changes in tax structure and level, and the adverse effect of foreign exchange controls.\nOur International operations involve contracts with, and regulation by, foreign governments. We operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance (including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations. Two former employees of Clear Media, a former indirect, non-wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company whose ordinary shares are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, have been convicted in China of certain crimes, including the crime of misappropriation of funds, and sentenced to imprisonment. For a description of this matter, refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements located in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because a large portion of our revenue and cash flows is received in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.\nWe generate a large portion of our revenue in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Additionally, a large portion of our cash flows are generated in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and certain of the indebtedness held by our international subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, exchange rate fluctuations in any currency from a country in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our profitability, and significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on our indebtedness.\nChanges in economic or political conditions in any of the foreign countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement, new currency or exchange controls, or other currency restrictions being imposed. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and positive impacts on our operating income as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nEffects of Brexit could adversely impact our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit of the U.K. from the E.U., commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" and on January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally withdrew from the E.U., entering into a transition period until December 31, 2020 during which the U.K.'s trading relationship with the E.U. remained the same while the two sides negotiated a free trade deal and other aspects of the U.K.'s future relationship with the E.U. A new trade deal was agreed upon between the U.K. and E.U. prior to the expiration of that transition period. Under this deal, which became effective on January 1, 2021, companies can still buy and sell goods across E.U. and U.K. borders without paying taxes; however, there are new checks and paperwork requirements, which could cause some delays and disruptions. Additionally, if in the future the U.K. or E.U. changes its rules, this could trigger a dispute which could ultimately lead to tariffs being imposed on some goods in the future. While the trade deal has delivered some clarity, its overall impact remains uncertain. Our International operations are currently headquartered in the U.K., and we transact business in many key European markets, including the U.K. The uncertainty around the impact of the trade deal on the economies of the U.K., the E.U. or other countries may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce the amount they spend on advertising. Any of these or similar effects of Brexit could adversely impact our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which may be caused by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including those previously described and the following:\n\u2022Our limited history operating as an independent public company;\n\u2022Our quarterly or annual earnings reports or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022Investors' perceptions of our prospects;\n\u2022Changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates, or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022Downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022Market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, the advertising industry;\n\u2022Changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022Announcements by us of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022Changes in key personnel; and\n\u2022Future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of our common stock or the issuance of equity awards by us may dilute your ownership percentage.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our stockholders, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\nAny additional capital raised by us through the sale of our common stock may also dilute your ownership in us. In the future, we may also issue our common stock in connection with acquisitions or investments. We cannot predict the size of any such future issuances, but the amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an acquisition or investment could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to remain in compliance with the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), and if the NYSE delists our common stock, it would have an adverse impact on the trading, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOn August 4, 2020, we received written notification from the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) that we were not in compliance with an NYSE continued listing standard in Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of our common stock fell below $1.00 over a period of 30 consecutive trading days.\nOn September 1, 2020, the NYSE notified us that we had regained compliance with the NYSE\u2019s continued listing standards after the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-trading days ended August 31, 2020 was above the NYSE\u2019s minimum requirement of $1.00 per share based on a 30-trading day average. However, we cannot assure you that the price of our common stock will continue to remain in compliance with this standard or that we will remain in compliance with any of the other applicable continued listing standards of the NYSE. The price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to, among other things, our financial results, market conditions and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny future failure to remain in compliance with the NYSE's continued listing standards, and any subsequent failure to timely resume compliance with the NYSE's continued listing standards within the applicable cure period, could have adverse consequences including, among others, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock, adverse publicity and a reduced interest in us from investors, analysts and other market participants. In addition, a suspension or delisting could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the public markets and our ability to attract and retain employees by means of equity compensation.\nWe currently do not pay regularly-scheduled dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we have paid certain special dividends in the past, we do not pay regularly-scheduled dividends and, should we seek to do so in the future, we are subject to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends by the indentures governing our outstanding debt. If we elect not to pay dividends in the future or are prevented from doing so, the price of our common stock must appreciate in order for you to realize a gain on your investment. This appreciation may not occur.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022For the first three years following the Separation, our board of directors will be divided into three equal classes, with members of each class elected in different years for different terms, making it impossible for stockholders to change the composition of our entire board of directors in any given year;\n\u2022Action by stockholders may only be taken at an annual or special meeting duly called by or at the direction of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022Advance notice for all stockholder proposals is required;\n\u2022Except as otherwise provided by a certificate of designations, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed from office as provided by Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"); and\n\u2022Except as required by law, for the first three years following the Separation, any amendment, alteration, rescission or repeal of our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our board of directors, including actions to delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nBecause we derive all of our operating income from our subsidiaries, our ability to repay our debt depends upon the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to dividend or distribute funds to us.\nWe derive all of our operating income from our subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flow and the ability to service our indebtedness depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and the ability of those entities to distribute funds to us. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, pay to us the amounts necessary to service our debt.\nCovenants in our debt indentures and credit agreements restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nOur material financing agreements contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. These agreements include covenants restricting, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022Incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022Pay dividends, redeem or purchase capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022Redeem, repurchase or retire our subordinated debt;\n\u2022Make certain investments;\n\u2022Create liens on our assets or on our restricted subsidiaries' assets to secure debt;\n\u2022Create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes;\n\u2022Enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022Merge or consolidate with another company, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022Sell certain assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022Alter the business that we conduct; and\n\u2022Designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThese restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs. In addition, under our Revolving Credit Facility, the suspension of the springing financial covenant will expire after the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, and we will be required to comply with a first lien net leverage ratio covenant starting with the reporting periods ending on and after September 30, 2021 if the balance of the Revolving Credit Facility is greater than $0 and undrawn letters of credit exceed $10 million at that time. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the agreements governing our indebtedness and, as a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur more debt, and this could exacerbate the risks associated with our leverage.\nAlthough our debt indentures and credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we and our subsidiaries could incur additional indebtedness in the future. For example, if permitted by the documents governing their indebtedness, our subsidiaries that are not guarantors, which include all of our foreign subsidiaries, may be able to incur more indebtedness under the indenture than our subsidiaries that are guarantors. Moreover, our debt indentures and credit agreements do not impose any limitation on our incurrence of liabilities that are not considered \u201cindebtedness\u201d and do not impose any limitation on liabilities incurred by our immaterial subsidiaries or our subsidiaries that might be designated as \u201cunrestricted subsidiaries.\u201d As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had no \u201cunrestricted subsidiaries.\u201d If we incur additional debt above current levels, the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, limit our financing options, reduce our flexibility under future financings and adversely affect our liquidity or business operations.\nOur corporate credit ratings are speculative-grade. Our corporate credit ratings and ratings outlook are subject to review by rating agencies from time to time and, on various occasions, have been downgraded. In the future, our corporate credit rating and rating outlook could be further downgraded. Any further reductions in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs, reduce the availability of financing to us or increase the cost of doing business or otherwise negatively impact our business operations.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations.\nThe London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and certain other interest \u201cbenchmarks\u201d may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021, and it is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve. If LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our debt obligations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Separation from iHeartCommunications\nOur historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to 2020 does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent public company not controlled by iHeartMedia during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future. Prior to the Separation, we operated as part of iHeartMedia\u2019s broader corporate organization, and subsidiaries of iHeartMedia performed various corporate functions for us, including executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, occupancy, procurement, information technology and other shared services. Additionally, we are also now solely responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent publicly-traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations, and public reporting. Our historical financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses from iHeartMedia for these and similar functions, but these allocations may not reflect the costs incurred for similar services as an independent publicly-traded company. Additionally, our historical financial information for periods prior to 2020 does not reflect the subsequent changes in our organizational structure as part of the Separation, including changes to our capital structure, tax structure and new personnel needs. Therefore, our historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance as an independent publicly-traded company, and we cannot assure you that our operating results will continue at a similar level.\nIn connection with the Separation, iHeartMedia agreed to indemnify us and we agreed to indemnify iHeartMedia for certain liabilities. There can be no assurance that the indemnities from iHeartMedia will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities.\nPursuant to agreements that we entered into with iHeartMedia in connection with the Separation, iHeartMedia agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, including certain tax matters, and we agreed to indemnify iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries for certain liabilities, including certain tax matters. For example, we will indemnify iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries for liabilities arising from or accruing prior to the closing date of the Separation to the extent such liabilities related our business, assets and liabilities, as well as liabilities relating to a breach of the Settlement and Separation Agreement governing the terms of the Separation. However, third parties might seek to hold us responsible for liabilities that iHeartMedia agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that iHeartMedia will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations under these agreements. In addition, indemnities that we may be required to provide to iHeartMedia and its subsidiaries could be significant and could adversely affect our business.\nGeneral Risks\nWe are dependent upon the performance of our senior management team and other key individuals.\nOur business is dependent upon the performance of our senior management team and other key individuals. Competition for these individuals is intense, and many of our key employees are at-will employees who are under no obligation to remain with us and may decide to leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control. If members of our senior management or key individuals decide to leave in the future, or if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining other key employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains various forward-looking statements which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including, without limitation, our future operating and financial performance, our restructuring plans, our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, and the availability of capital and the terms thereof.
