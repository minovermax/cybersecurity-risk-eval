{"cik": "1288750", "company": "Timberline Resources Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-01-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in an exploration stage mining company such as ours involves an unusually high degree of risk, known and unknown, present and potential, including, but not limited to the risks enumerated below.\nFailure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock may decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. We cannot assure you that we will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect our business.\nEstimates of mineralized material are forward-looking statements inherently subject to error. Although mineralization and reserve estimates require a high degree of assurance in the underlying data when the estimates are made, unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors can have significant adverse or positive impacts on the estimates. Actual results will inherently differ from estimates. The unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors include: geologic uncertainties including inherent sample variability, metal price fluctuations, variations in mining and processing parameters, and adverse changes in environmental or mining laws and regulations. We cannot accurately predict the timing and effects of variances from estimated values.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOur ability to operate as a going concern is in doubt.\nThe audit opinion and notes that accompany our consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2019, disclose a \u2018going concern\u2019 qualification to our ability to continue in business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since our inception. We do not have sufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet all of our obligations for the next 12 months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities and/or raising additional funds.\nWe currently have no historical recurring source of revenue, and our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise capital to fund our future exploration and working capital requirements or our ability to profitably execute our business plan. Our plans for the long-term return to and continuation as a going concern include engaging in a strategic transaction which may include selling the Company or any or all of its assets, entering into joint venture arrangements regarding our assets, financing our future operations through sales of our common stock and/or debt and/or the eventual profitable exploitation of our mining properties. As of the date of this report, we have negative working capital. Additionally, the current capital markets and general economic conditions in the United States are significant obstacles to raising the required funds. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. If the going concern basis were not appropriate for these financial statements, adjustments would be necessary in the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and the balance sheet classifications used. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties and our failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects.\nAlthough we have been in the business of exploring mineral properties since our incorporation in 1968, we were inactive for many years prior to our new management in 2004. Since 2004 we have not yet established any mineral reserves. As a result, we have not had any revenues from our exploration division. However, we have had a drilling services wholly-owned subsidiary which has generated revenues in past fiscal years. In addition, our operating history has been restricted to the acquisition and exploration of our mineral properties, and this does not provide a meaningful basis for an evaluation of our prospects if we ever determine that we have a mineral reserve and commence the construction and operation of a mine. Other than through conventional and typical exploration methods and procedures, we have no additional way to evaluate the likelihood of whether our mineral properties contain any mineral reserves or, if they do that they will be operated successfully. As a result, we are subject to all of the risks associated with developing and establishing new mining operations and business enterprises including:\n\uf0b7completion of feasibility studies to verify reserves and commercial viability, including the ability to find sufficient gold reserves to support a commercial mining operation;\n\uf0b7the timing and cost, which can be considerable, of further exploration, preparing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of infrastructure, mining, and processing facilities;\n\uf0b7the availability and costs of drill equipment, exploration personnel, skilled labor, and mining and processing equipment, if required;\n\uf0b7compliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements;\n\uf0b7the availability of funds to finance exploration, development, and construction activities, as warranted;\n\uf0b7potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups, or local inhabitants which may delay or prevent development activities;\n\uf0b7potential increases in exploration, construction, and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power, materials, and supplies; and\n\uf0b7potential shortages of mineral processing, construction, and other facilities-related supplies.\nThe costs, timing, and complexities of exploration, development, and construction activities may be increased by the location of our properties and demand by other mineral exploration and mining companies. It is common in exploration programs to experience unexpected problems and delays during drill programs and, if warranted, development, construction, and mine start-up. Accordingly, our activities may not result in profitable mining operations and we may not succeed in establishing mining operations or profitably producing metals at any of our properties. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the future. We incurred the following net losses during each of the following periods:\n\uf0b7$1,657,283 for the year ended September 30, 2019;\n\uf0b7$5,057,794 for the year ended September 30, 2018; and\n\uf0b7$1,645,800 for the year ended September 30, 2017\nWe had an accumulated deficit of approximately $60.2 million as of September 30, 2019. We expect to continue to incur losses unless and until such time as one of our properties enters into commercial production and generates sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from mining operations and dispositions of our properties, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. At this early stage of our operation, we also expect to face the risks, uncertainties, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies at the start-up stage of their business development. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties and our failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Associated with Mining and Exploration\nOur Elder Creek Project is subject to certain future work expenditure requirements in order for us to earn an ownership portion of the property. The underlying Elder Creek JV with McEwen which Timberline (assumed from AGEI) has an earn-in right as operator with terms of earn-in as follows:\n\uf0b751% Earn-In for $2.6 M over 4 years by December 31, 2021, consisting of:\n\uf0b7Year 1: $100,000 One Time Cash Payment by May 17, 2018 amended to September 28, 2018 (completed)\n\uf0b7Year 1: $500,000 Work Commitment by December 31, 2018 (completed)\n\uf0b7Year 2: $500,000 Work Commitment by December 31, 2019 (completed)\n\uf0b7Year 3: $750,000 Work Commitment by December 31, 2020\n\uf0b7Year 4: $750,000 Work Commitment by December 31, 2021\n\uf0b765% Earn-In for an additional $2.5M work commitment for a total of $5.1M over 6 years by December 31, 2023.\nWe have met the work commitments for the Year 1 obligation and those of Year 2 ended December 31, 2019. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds through capital raising activities or through bringing in a project partner prior to the payment date, we may not have sufficient funds to meet our other future work commitment obligations at the time they become due under the agreement terms. If we are unable to make the expenditures by the specified dates and we are unable to negotiate an extension or new terms, we would default under the earn-in agreement and risk having the project revert back to the current owner and our investments in the project would be lost, which could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nAll of our properties are in the exploration stage. There is no assurance that we can establish the existence of any mineral reserve on any of our properties in commercially exploitable quantities. Until we can do so, we cannot earn any revenues from these properties, and if we do not do so, we will lose all of the funds that we expend on exploration. If we do not discover any mineral reserve in a commercially exploitable quantity, the exploration component of our business could fail.\nWe have not established that any of our mineral properties contain any mineral reserves according to recognized reserve guidelines, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to do so. A mineral reserve is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its Industry Guide 7 as that part of a mineral deposit, which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The probability of an individual prospect ever having a \"reserve\" that meets the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Industry Guide 7 is extremely remote; in all probability, our mineral properties do not contain any \u201creserve\u201d, and any funds that we spend on exploration will probably be lost. Even if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on one or more of our properties, there can be no assurance that they can be developed into producing mines to extract those minerals. Both mineral exploration and development involve a high degree of risk, and few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.\nThe commercial viability of an established mineral deposit will depend on a number of factors including, by way of example, the size, grade, and other attributes of the mineral deposit, the proximity of the mineral deposit to infrastructure such as a smelter, roads, and a point for shipping, government regulation, and market prices. Most of these factors will be beyond our control, and any of them could increase costs and make extraction of any identified mineral deposit unprofitable.\nMineral operations are subject to applicable law and government regulation. Even if we discover a mineral reserve in a commercially exploitable quantity, these laws and regulations could restrict or prohibit the exploitation of that mineral reserve. If we cannot exploit any mineral reserve that we might discover on our properties, our business may fail.\nBoth mineral exploration and extraction require permits from various foreign, federal, state, provincial, and local governmental authorities and are governed by laws and regulations, including those with respect to prospecting, mine development, mineral production, transport, export, taxation, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety, and other matters. Regarding our future ground disturbing activity on federal land, we will be required to obtain a permit from the US Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management prior to commencing exploration. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain any of the permits required for the continued exploration of our mineral properties or for the construction and operation of a mine on our properties at economically viable costs. If we cannot accomplish these objectives, our business could face difficulty and/or fail.\nWe believe that we are in compliance with all material laws and regulations that currently apply to our activities, but there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. Current laws and regulations could be amended, and we might not be able to comply with them, as amended. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all permits necessary for our future operations, or that we will be able to obtain them on reasonable terms. To the extent such approvals are required and are not obtained, we may be delayed or prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration or development of our mineral properties.\nEnvironmental hazards unknown to us, which have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the properties, may exist on the properties in which we hold an interest. In past years, we have been engaged in exploration in northern Idaho, which is currently the site of a Federal Superfund cleanup project. Although we are no longer involved in this or other areas at present, it is possible that environmental cleanup or other environmental restoration procedures could remain to be completed or mandated by law, causing unpredictable and unexpected liabilities to arise. At the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any environmental issues or litigation relating to any of our current or former properties.\nFuture legislation and administrative changes to the mining laws could prevent us from exploring our properties.\nNew state and U.S. federal laws and regulations, amendments to existing laws and regulations, administrative interpretation of existing laws and regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct exploration and mining activities. Any change in the regulatory structure making it more expensive to engage in mining activities could cause us to cease operations.\nRegulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us, our venture partners, and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, and changing temperatures. These impacts may adversely impact the cost, production, and financial performance of our operations.\nIf we establish the existence of a mineral reserve on any of our properties in a commercially exploitable quantity, we will require additional capital in order to develop the property into a producing mine. If we cannot raise this additional capital, we will not be able to exploit the reserve, and our business could fail.\nIf we do discover mineral reserves in commercially exploitable quantities on any of our properties, we will be required to expend substantial sums of money to establish the extent of the reserve, develop processes to extract it, and develop extraction and processing facilities and infrastructure. There can be no assurance that a mineral reserve will be large enough to justify commercial operations, nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to raise the funds required for development on a timely basis. If we cannot raise the necessary capital or complete the necessary facilities and infrastructure, our business may fail.\nLand reclamation requirements for our properties may be burdensome and expensive.\nAlthough variable depending on location and the governing authority, land reclamation requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies (as well as companies with mining operations) in order to minimize long-term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation may include requirements to control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents and re-establish pre-disturbance land forms and vegetation.\nIn order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with our potential development activities, we must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further exploration and development programs. We plan to set up a provision for our reclamation obligations on our properties, as appropriate, but this provision may not be adequate. If we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work, our financial position could be adversely affected.\nMining exploration and development are inherently hazardous and subject to conditions or events beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans.\nMining and mineral exploration involves various types of risks and hazards, including:\n\uf0b7environmental hazards;\n\uf0b7power outages;\n\uf0b7metallurgical and other processing problems;\n\uf0b7unusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\uf0b7personal injury, flooding, fire, explosions, cave-ins, landslides, and rock-bursts;\n\uf0b7inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment, or labor;\n\uf0b7metals losses;\n\uf0b7fluctuations in exploration, development, and production costs;\n\uf0b7labor disputes;\n\uf0b7unanticipated variations in grade;\n\uf0b7mechanical equipment failure; and\n\uf0b7periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions.\nThese risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, production facilities, or other properties, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining, increased production costs, monetary losses, and possible legal liability.\nMineral exploration and development is subject to extraordinary operating risks. We do not currently insure against these risks. In the event of a cave-in or similar occurrence, our liability may exceed our resources, which would have an adverse impact on our Company.\nMineral exploration, development, and production involve many risks, which even a combination of experience, knowledge, and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Our operations will be subject to all the hazards and risks inherent in the exploration, development and production of minerals, including liability for pollution, cave-ins or similar hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. Any such event could result in work stoppages and damage to property, including damage to the environment. We do not currently maintain any insurance coverage against these operating hazards. The payment of any liabilities that arise from any such occurrence could have a material adverse impact on our Company.\nIncreased costs could affect our financial condition.\nWe anticipate that costs at our projects that we may explore or develop will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, metallurgy, and revisions to mine plans, if any, in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel, rubber, and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability.\nA shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nWe are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and, if warranted, development operations. Any shortage of such supplies, equipment, and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and, therefore, limit or increase the cost of production.\nEstimates of mineralized material are subject to evaluation uncertainties that could result in project failure.\nOur exploration and future mining operations, if any, are and would be faced with risks associated with being able to accurately predict the quantity and quality of mineralized material within the earth using statistical sampling techniques. Estimates of any mineralized material on any of our properties would be made using samples obtained from appropriately placed trenches, test pits, and underground workings and intelligently designed drilling. There is an inherent variability of assays between check and duplicate samples taken adjacent to each other and between sampling points that cannot be reasonably eliminated. Additionally, there also may be unknown geologic details that have not been identified or correctly appreciated at the current level of accumulated knowledge about our properties. This could result in uncertainties that cannot be reasonably eliminated\nfrom the process of estimating mineralized material. If these estimates were to prove to be unreliable, we could implement an exploitation plan that may not lead to commercially viable operations in the future.\nMineral prices are subject to dramatic and unpredictable fluctuations.\nWe expect to derive revenues, if any, from the eventual extraction and sale of precious metals such as gold and silver. The price of those commodities has fluctuated widely in recent years, and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control including international, economic and political trends, expectations of inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates, global or regional consumptive patterns, speculative activities and increased production due to new extraction developments, and improved extraction and production methods. The effect of these factors on the price of precious metals, and, therefore, the economic viability of any of our exploration projects, cannot accurately be predicted.\nThe mining industry is highly competitive and there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in acquiring mineral claims. If we cannot continue to acquire properties to explore for mineralized material, we may be required to reduce or cease exploration activity and/or operations.\nThe mineral exploration, development, and production industry is largely fragmented. We compete with other exploration companies looking for mineral properties and the minerals that can be produced from them. While we compete with other exploration companies in the effort to locate and license mineral properties, we do not compete with them for the removal or sales of mineral products from our properties if we should eventually discover the presence of them in quantities sufficient to make production economically feasible. Readily available markets exist worldwide for the sale of gold and other mineral products. Therefore, we will likely be able to sell any gold or mineral products that we identify and produce.\nThere are hundreds of public and private companies that are actively engaged in mineral exploration. A representative sample of exploration companies that are similar to us in size, financial resources, and primary objective include such publicly traded mineral exploration companies as Allegiant Gold Ltd. (AUAU.V), NuLegacy Gold Corp (NUG.V), Otis Gold Corp. (OGLDF), Adamara Minerals Corp. (ADZ.V), Comstock Mining Inc. (LODE).\nMany of our competitors have greater financial resources and technical facilities. Accordingly, we will attempt to compete primarily through the knowledge and experience of our management. This competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable prospects for exploration in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will acquire any interest in additional mineral properties that might yield reserves or result in commercial mining operations.\nThird parties may challenge our rights to our mineral properties, or the agreements that permit us to explore our properties may expire, if we fail to timely renew them and pay the required fees.\nIn connection with the acquisition of our mineral properties, we sometimes conduct only limited reviews of title and related matters, and obtain certain representations regarding ownership. These limited reviews do not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title and, furthermore, our title may be defective. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we hold good and marketable title to all of our mining concessions and mining claims. If any of our concessions or claims were challenged, we could incur significant costs and lose valuable time in defending such a challenge. These costs or an adverse ruling with regards to any challenge of our titles could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. There can be no assurance that any such disputes or challenges will be resolved in our favor.\nWe are not aware of challenges to the location or area of any of our mining claims. There is, however, no guarantee that title to the claims will not be challenged or impugned in the future.\nAcquisitions and integration issues may expose us to risks.\nOur business strategy includes making targeted acquisitions. Any acquisition that we make may be of a significant size, may change the scale of our business and operations, and may expose us to new geographic, political, operating, financial, and geological risks. Our success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and integrate the acquired operations successfully with our own. Any acquisitions would be accompanied by risks. For example, there may be significant decreases in commodity prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and have established the purchase price or exchange ratio; a potential mineralized property may prove to be below expectations; we may have difficulty integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; the integration of the acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, and contractors; and the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. If we choose to use\nequity securities as consideration for such an acquisition, existing shareholders may suffer dilution. Alternatively, we may choose to finance any such acquisition with our existing resources. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions.\nJoint ventures and other partnerships in relation to our properties may expose us to risks.\nWe are currently involved in, and may enter into in the future, joint ventures or other partnership arrangements with other parties in relation to the exploration, development, and production of certain of the properties in which we have an interest. Joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions such as an increase or reduction of registered capital, merger, division, dissolution, amendments of constating documents, and the pledge of joint venture assets, which means that each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions which could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture or partnership. Further, we may be unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties. Any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to us or to third parties, or any disputes with respect to the parties' respective rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial performance, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nMinimal staffing may be reasonably likely to materially affect the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting\nWith a very limited staff, it is difficult to maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiating and recording of transactions, thereby creating a segregation of duties weakness. Due to the significance of segregation of duties to the preparation of reliable financial statements, this weakness may result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements not be prevented or detected.\nConflicts of Interest\nCertain of our officers and directors may be or become associated with other businesses, including natural resource companies that acquire interests in mineral properties. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. Our directors are required by Delaware Corporation law to act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and to disclose any interest, which they may have in any of our projects or opportunities. In general, if a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of the board of directors, any director in a conflict will disclose his interest and abstain from voting on such matter or, if he does vote, his vote will not be counted.\nWe have not adopted any separate formal corporate policy regarding conflicts of interest; however, other corporate governance measures have been adopted, such as creating a directors\u2019 audit committee requiring independent directors. Additionally, our Code of Ethics does address areas of possible conflicts of interest. As of the date of filing of this report, we had three independent directors on our board of directors (Leigh Freeman, Paul Dircksen and David Mathewson). We have formed three committees to ensure our legal compliance. We established an independent audit committee consisting of two independent directors, both of whom were determined to be \u201cfinancially literate\u201d and one of whom was designated as the \u201cfinancial expert.\u201d We also formed a compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors and a corporate governance and nominating committee, a majority of which is comprised of independent directors. At this time, we feel that these committees and our Code of Ethics provide sufficient corporate governance for our purposes.\nDependence on Key Management Employees\nOur ability to continue our exploration and development activities and to develop a competitive edge in the marketplace depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and maintain qualified key management personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. Our development now and in the future will depend on the efforts of key management figures such as Steven Osterberg and Ted Sharp. The loss of any of these key people could have a material adverse effect on our business. In this regard, we have attempted to reduce the risk associated with the loss of key personnel and have obtained directors and officers insurance coverage. In addition, our shareholders have approved our 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan and 2018 Incentive Plan so that we can provide incentives for our key personnel.\nWe may not realize the benefits of Eureka, Elder Creek, Paiute, Lookout Mountain, Seven Troughs and other acquired growth projects.\nAs part of our strategy, we will continue existing efforts and initiate new efforts to develop gold and other mineral properties. We have four such project areas, including Eureka, Elder Creek, Paiute, Lookout Mountain and Seven Troughs. A number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the development of these types of projects, including political, regulatory, design, construction, labor, operating, technical and technological risks, and uncertainties relating to capital and other costs and financing risks. The failure to successfully develop any of these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nAs part of our business model, we pursue a strategy that may cause us to expend significant resources exploring properties that may not become revenue-producing sites, including the Eureka projects.\nPart of our business model is to pursue a strategy which includes significant exploration activities, such as proposed exploration and, if warranted, development at the Eureka, Elder Creek, Paiute, and the Seven Troughs projects. Because of the nature of exploration for precious metals, a property\u2019s exploration potential is not known until a significant amount of geologic information has been generated. We may spend significant resources exploring and developing the projects and gathering certain geologic information only to determine that the project is not capable of being a revenue-producing property for us.\nOur business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. For example, on July 21, 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) with increased disclosure obligations for public companies and mining companies in the United States. Our efforts to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and other new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from operating activities to compliance activities.\nWe are required to comply with Canadian securities regulations and are subject to additional regulatory scrutiny in Canada.\nWe are a \u201creporting issuer\u201d in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. As a result, our disclosure outside the United States differs from the disclosure contained in our SEC filings. Our reserve and resource estimates disseminated outside the United States are not directly comparable to those made in filings subject to SEC reporting and disclosure requirements, as we generally report reserves and resources in accordance with Canadian practices. These practices are different from the practices used to report reserve and resource estimates in reports and other materials filed with the SEC. It is Canadian practice to report measured, indicated, and inferred resources, which are generally not permitted in disclosure filed with the SEC. In the United States, mineralization may not be classified as a \u201creserve\u201d unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. Further, \u201cinferred resources\u201d have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Disclosure of \u201ccontained ounces\u201d is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC only permits issuers to report \u201cresources\u201d as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization, reserves, and resources contained in disclosure released outside the United States may not be comparable to information made public by other United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.\nWe are also subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and costs associated with complying with securities legislation in Canada. For example, we are subject to civil liability for misrepresentations in written disclosure and oral statements. Legislation has been enacted in these provinces which creates a right of action for damages against a reporting issuer, its directors and certain of its officers in the event that the reporting issuer or a person with actual, implied, or apparent authority to act or speak on behalf of the reporting issuer releases a document or makes a public oral statement that contains a misrepresentation or the reporting issuer fails to make timely disclosure of a material change. We do not anticipate any particular regulation that would be difficult to comply with. However, failure to comply with regulations may result in civil awards, fines, penalties, and orders that could have an adverse effect on us.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Market (\u201cOTCQB\u201d) and traded on the TSX Venture Exchange (\u201cTSX-V\u201d). The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include price fluctuations of precious metals, government regulations, disputes regarding mining claims, broad stock market fluctuations, and general economic conditions in the United States and Canada.\nWe do not intend to pay any dividends on shares of our common stock in the near future.\nWe do not currently anticipate declaring and paying dividends to our shareholders in the near future, and any future decision as to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, financial position, capital requirements, plans for expansion, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. It is our current intention to apply net earnings, if any, in the foreseeable future to finance the growth and development of our business.\nInvestors\u2019 interests in our Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share, if we issue additional employee/director/consultant options or if we sell additional shares and/or warrants to finance our operations.\nWe have not generated material revenue from exploration since the commencement of our exploration stage in January 2004. In order to further expand our company and meet our objectives, any additional growth and/or expanded exploration activity may need to be financed through sale and issuance of additional shares, including, but not limited to, raising finances to explore our properties. Furthermore, to finance any acquisition activity, should that activity be properly approved, and depending on the outcome of our exploration programs, we may also need to issue additional shares to finance future acquisitions, growth and/or additional exploration programs at any or all of our projects or to acquire additional properties. We may also in the future grant to some or all of our directors, officers, insiders, and key employees options to purchase our common shares and stock unit awards as non-cash incentives. The issuance of any equity securities could, and the issuance of any additional shares will, cause our existing shareholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests.\nIf we issue additional shares or decide to enter into joint ventures with other parties in order to raise financing through the sale of equity securities, investors' interests in our Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. As of the date of the filing of this report there are also outstanding options and warrants granted that are exercisable into 48,769,967 common shares. If all of these options and warrants were exercised, the underlying shares would represent approximately 42% of our issued and outstanding shares. If all of these options and warrants are exercised and the underlying shares are issued, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders. The dilution may result in a decline in the market price of our shares.\nWe are subject to the continued listing criteria of the TSX-V and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our shares of common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are currently listed on the TSX-V. In order to maintain the listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial, and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to objective standards, the TSX-V may delist our securities if, in their discretionary opinion: (i) our financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; (ii) it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on TSX-V inadvisable; (iii) we sell or dispose of principal operating assets or cease to be an operating company; (iv) we fail to comply with the listing requirements of the TSX-V; (v) our shares of common stock sell at what the TSX-V considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d and if we fail to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the TSX-V; or (vi) any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the TSX-V, in their opinion, inadvisable.\nIf the TSX-V delists our shares of common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.", "PERMNO": 92669, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "TLRS"}
