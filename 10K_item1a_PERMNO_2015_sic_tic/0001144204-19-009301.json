Risk Factors\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influence outcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be external to the Company and entirely outside of our control.\nWe cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements.\nCertain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, you should not consider this recitation to be complete.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Dissolution and Liquidation\nThe proposed dissolution and liquidation of the Company may not be completed in a timely manner or at all.\nOn February 4, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, pursuant to which the Company would, subject to obtaining requisite stockholder approval, be liquidated and dissolved in accordance with Sections 280 and 281(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. In approving the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, our Board of Directors had considered, among other factors, the ability of the Company to obtain no-action relief from the SEC to suspend certain of the Company\u2019s reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the anticipated cost savings if such relief is granted by the SEC. After further consideration, our Board of Directors determined that it would be fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to postpone seeking stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution until a later time to be determined by our Board of Directors.\nFrom time to time, our Board of Directors reviews the Company\u2019s status and prospects in deciding on the timing of dissolution and liquidation of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution. If our Board of Directors determines to seek stockholder approval of such plan and such plan is approved by our stockholders and implemented by the Company, it is expected that our corporate existence will continue for the purpose of winding up our business and affairs for at least three years. We have forecasted minimal or no royalty or milestone revenues for the foreseeable future. In light of the uncertainty as to whether any of the milestones under the Micromet Marketing Agreement would be achieved, this forecast assumes that we would not receive any milestone or royalty payments under the Micromet Marketing Agreement.\nThe amount we distribute to our stockholders as liquidating distributions, if any, pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution may be substantially less than estimated.\nAt present, we cannot determine with certainty the amount of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders if the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution is implemented. The amount of cash ultimately distributed to our stockholders in any liquidating distribution pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution depends on, among other things, the amount of our liabilities, obligations and expenses and claims against us, and the amount of the reserves that we establish during the liquidation process. Estimates of these amounts may be inaccurate. Factors that could impact these estimates include the following: (i) if any of the estimates regarding the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, including the expenses to satisfy outstanding obligations, liabilities and claims during the liquidation process, are inaccurate, (ii) if litigation is brought against us or our directors and officers, if unforeseen claims are asserted against us, we will have to defend or resolve such claims or establish a reasonable reserve before making distributions to our stockholders, (iii) if the estimates regarding the expenses to be incurred in the liquidation process, including expenses of personnel required and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidate the Company, are inaccurate and (iv) if we continue to incur significant expenses related to ongoing reporting obligations.\nRisks Relating to the Company and its Operations\nUntil 2017, in recent years, we derived most of our royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which have been in sharp decline and have been subject to recoupments for substantial returns and rebates. In addition, our right to receive royalties on U.S. and European sales of PegIntron expired in 2016 and 2018, respectively, which has negatively impacted our royalty revenues.\nUntil 2017, in recent years, we had derived most of our royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck. Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for approximately (2)% and 7% of our total royalty revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, net of the effects of adjustments for Merck\u2019s recoupment of previously overpaid royalties. Sales of PegIntron have been in sharp decline in recent years, and our right to receive royalties on U.S. and European sales of PegIntron expired in 2016 and 2018, respectively, which adversely affected our operating results and financial position. As reported by Merck, sales declines were driven by lower volumes in nearly all regions as the availability of new therapeutic options resulted in continued loss of market share. It is unlikely that Merck will continue to generate sales of PegIntron at levels that would enable us to receive royalties in amounts that are comparable with the amounts of royalties that we have received in recent years. In addition, product returns and rebates may limit future royalties and allow Merck to recoup prior paid royalties. Neither the amount nor timing of resources dedicated by Merck to the marketing of PegIntron nor Merck\u2019s policies related to product returns and rebates is within our control. In addition, there are multiple oral drug therapies, both available and in development, that have been effective for treatment of hepatitis C that do not require interferon. As a result, we expect that sales of PegIntron-related products will continue their declining trend.\nWe may not be able to sustain profitability and we may incur losses over the next several years.\nWe have incurred losses in the past and have limited sources of revenues. Our revenues and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods due to variations in our recurring royalty revenues, which are expected to continue to decline. In anticipation of the revenue decline, we have commensurately reduced our operating expenses, including the cessation of our research and development activities, elimination of our workforce, discontinuance of our significant lease commitment and the use of consultants in order to sustain profitability. However, with the sustained decline in revenue and the expectation of continued operating expenses, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining profitability.\nCertain of our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug products have already expired and our remaining rights to receive royalties will expire in the near future and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues.\nMerck\u2019s obligation to pay us royalties on sales of PegIntron terminates, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of the date on which the last patent to contain a claim covering PegIntron expires in the country or 15 years after the date on which PegIntron was first approved for commercial marketing in such country. Our right to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron expired in the U.S. in 2016, expired in Europe in 2018 and will expire in Malaysia in 2020, Japan in 2021 and Chile in 2024. We currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. As a result, following expirations of our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug products or potential drug products, we may not have sufficient revenues to continue operations.\nWe may not realize our deferred income tax assets.\nThe ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. The valuation allowance may fluctuate as conditions change. Our ability to utilize net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cIRC\u201d). In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d at any time over the testing period.\nAn ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOL carryforwards. There can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. See Note 10 to our Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this document.\nWe have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions.\nWe have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations of our business effectively could be compromised.\nWe may be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our previously conducted clinical trials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims.\nWe may face liability claims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in previously conducted clinical trials. These claims may be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments against us. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, might result in significant costs to defend or awards against us, and our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from such claims. A successful product liability or other claim brought against us could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are party to license and other collaboration agreements that contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could cause the value of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are party to license, collaboration and other agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These agreements contain complex commercial terms, including royalties on drug sales based on a number of complex variables (including net sales calculations, geography, scope of patent claim coverage, patent life and other factors) and indemnification obligations. From time to time, we may have dispute resolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements. One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which could cause the value of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are party to license agreements whereby we may receive royalties from products subject to regulatory approval.\nOur licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide events:\n\u00b7 the level of revenues we generate from royalties we receive;\n\u00b7 changes in our business plans;\n\u00b7 the losses we may incur;\n\u00b7 developments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;\n\u00b7 public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by others; and\n\u00b7 litigation.\nIn addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could materially decline.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our common stock is low and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does not assure that a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock. This significantly limits the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently, and are not expected in the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX market. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock.\nThe declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future royalty revenues, which are expected to decrease sharply over the next several years, as well as our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations.\nIn April 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors intends to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, in the form of periodic dividends to our stockholders. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore, our Board of Directors could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenues from existing and any future royalties and/or milestone payments and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. Our future revenues from existing royalties have decreased sharply over the last several years and are expected to continue to decrease sharply over the next several years (and eventually cease altogether) due to eventual expirations over time of our right to receive royalties under the terms of our existing licensing arrangements. Future revenues from existing royalties may also decline due to decreases in the sales of the drug products for which we have the right to receive royalties. There is no assurance that we will have sufficient royalty revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future. Moreover, if we file a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, the applicable Delaware court may impose limitations on our ability to declare dividends prior to the final dissolution of the Company. Any inability to pay dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:\n\u00b7 lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7 the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7 advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7 limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.\nThe provisions described above and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price.\nOur previous Section 382 rights plan expired on April 30, 2017 and has not been replaced.\nThe issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of our common stockholders.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of such preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 33137, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ENZN"}
