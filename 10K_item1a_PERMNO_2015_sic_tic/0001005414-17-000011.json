{"cik": "1005414", "company": "TOYS R US INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be less significant than the following risk factors, may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business is highly seasonal, and our financial performance depends significantly on the results of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and, as a result, our operating results could be materially adversely affected if we achieve less than satisfactory sales prior to or during the holiday season.\nOur business is highly seasonal. During fiscals 2016, 2015 and 2014, 40%, 41% and 40%, respectively, of our total Net sales were generated in the fourth quarter. We typically incur net losses in each of the first three quarters of the year, with a substantial portion of our operating earnings generated in the fourth quarter. As a result, we depend significantly upon the fourth quarter holiday selling season. If we achieve less than satisfactory sales, operating earnings or cash flows from operating activities during the fourth quarter, we may not be able to compensate sufficiently for the lower sales, operating earnings or cash flows from operating activities during the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Our results in any given period may be affected by dates on which important holidays fall and the shopping patterns relating to those holidays. Additionally, the concentrated nature of our seasonal sales means that our operating results could be materially adversely affected if we achieve less than satisfactory sales prior to or during the holiday season, including as a result of natural disasters, labor strikes, work stoppages, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, prior to or during the holiday season, as described below.\nOur industry is highly competitive and competitive conditions may materially adversely affect our revenues and overall profitability.\nThe retail industry is highly and increasingly competitive and our results of operations are sensitive to, and may be materially adversely affected by competitive pricing, promotional pressures, competitor credit programs, additional competitor store openings, growth of e-commerce competitors and other factors. As a specialty retailer that primarily focuses on toys and baby products, we compete with discount and mass merchandisers, such as Walmart and Target, as well as Internet and catalog businesses, such as Amazon.com, national and regional chains and department stores and local retailers in the markets we serve. We also compete with national and local discount stores, consumer electronics retailers, supermarkets and warehouse clubs. Competition is principally based on product variety, price, quality, availability, advertising and promotion, convenience or store location, safety and customer support and service. We believe that some of our competitors in the toy and baby products markets, as well as in the other markets in which we compete, have a larger market share than our market share. In addition, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do.\nMuch of the merchandise we sell is also available from various retailers at competitive prices. Discount and mass merchandisers use aggressive pricing policies and enlarged toy-selling areas during the holiday season to increase sales and build traffic for other store departments. Our business is vulnerable to shifts in demand and pricing, as well as consumer preferences.\nWe are vulnerable to competitive pressures from e-commerce activity in the market, both as they impact our own e-commerce business and our stores. The Internet provides greater price transparency of our merchandise that is widely available to customers. Our \u201cPrice Match Guarantee\u201d may lead to reduced margins as a result of intense price competition, especially during the holiday selling season. In addition, sales of video games have been impacted by a shift to sales in channels other than traditional retail stores, including direct online distribution to customers through download, subscription or cloud play, which eliminates the need for a retailer. Furthermore, competitors\u2019 subscription models for diapers, formula, and other consumables may eliminate the need for customers to visit our stores or e-commerce websites. We believe that this e-commerce activity has adversely affected our sales and profitability, and any increase in the proportion of our customers\u2019 purchases via the Internet could materially adversely affect our sales and profitability from physical stores.\nThe baby registry market is highly competitive, based on convenience, quality and selection of merchandise offerings and functionality. Our baby registry primarily competes with the baby registries of mass merchandisers, Internet retailers and other specialty format and regional retailers. Some of our competitors have been aggressively advertising and marketing their baby registries through national television, magazine and Internet campaigns. These trends present consumers with more choices for their baby registry needs, and as a result, increase competition for our baby registry.\nIf we fail to compete successfully, we could face lower sales and may decide or be compelled to offer greater discounts to our customers, which could result in decreased profitability.\nOur sales may be adversely affected by changes in economic factors and changes in consumer spending patterns.\nMany economic and other factors outside our control, including consumer confidence, consumer spending levels, employment levels, consumer debt levels, individual income tax and sales tax rates, inflation and deflation, as well as the availability of consumer credit, affect consumer spending habits. A significant deterioration in the global financial markets and economic environment, recessions or an uncertain economic outlook adversely affects consumer spending habits and results in lower levels of economic activity. The domestic and international political situation, including the economic health of various political jurisdictions, also affects economic conditions and consumer confidence. In addition, changing economic and regulatory conditions and increasing consumer credit delinquencies may cause banks to re-evaluate their lending practices and terms which could have an adverse effect on our credit card program and consequently, an adverse effect on our sales. Any of these events and factors could cause consumers to curtail spending and could have a negative impact on our financial performance and position in future fiscal periods.\nOur operations have significant liquidity and capital requirements and depend on the availability of adequate financing on reasonable terms. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could have a significant negative effect on our business.\nWe have significant liquidity and capital requirements. Among other things, the seasonality of our businesses requires us to purchase merchandise well in advance of the fourth quarter holiday selling season. We depend on our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities, as well as on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our credit lines, to finance the carrying costs of this inventory and to pay for capital expenditures and operating expenses. As of January 28, 2017, we had total outstanding borrowings of $465 million under our revolving credit facilities and credit lines. As of January 28, 2017, we had unused availability under committed lines of credit of $905 million. For fiscal 2016, peak borrowings under all of our revolving credit facilities and credit lines were $1,331 million, as we purchased merchandise for the fourth quarter holiday selling season. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could have a significant negative effect on our business. In addition, any adverse change to our credit ratings or our business could negatively impact our ability to refinance our debt on satisfactory terms and could have the effect of increasing our financing costs. While we believe we currently have adequate sources of funds to provide for our ongoing operations and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, any inability on our part to have future access to financing, when needed, would have a negative effect on our business.\nA loss of, or reduction in, trade credit from our vendors could reduce our liquidity, increase our working capital needs and/or limit our ability to purchase products.\nTrade credit from our vendors is an important source of financing for the purchase of the inventory we sell in our stores. Accordingly, the loss of, or reduction in, trade credit could have a significant adverse impact on our inventory levels and operating cash flow and negatively impact our liquidity. Our vendors may seek credit insurance to protect against non-payment of amounts due to them. If credit insurance is not available to vendors at reasonable terms or at all, vendors may demand accelerated payment of amounts due to them or require advance payments or letters of credit before goods are shipped to us. A negative change in our credit ratings or our vendors\u2019 perception of our creditworthiness, including due to pending debt maturities, may impact their willingness to provide trade credit to us. Any adverse changes in our trade credit for these or other reasons could increase our costs of financing our inventory or negatively impact our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could in turn negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe may not retain or attract customers if we fail to successfully implement our strategic initiatives, which could result in lower sales and a failure to realize the benefit of the expenditures incurred for these initiatives.\nWe continue to implement a series of customer-oriented strategic programs designed to differentiate and strengthen our core merchandise content and service levels and to expand and enhance our merchandise offerings. As part of our omnichannel strategy to integrate our e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses, we aim to satisfy our customers\u2019 evolving shopping preferences by utilizing fulfillment channels such as \u201cIn-Store Pick Up,\u201d \u201cShip from Store\u201d and \u201cShip to Store.\u201d In an effort to optimize our e-commerce operations and improve the customer experience online, we are currently developing an e-commerce platform which will allow us to manage certain aspects of our e-commerce operations internally rather than through a third-party provider.\nWe continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs for our \u201cR\u201d Us stores and e-commerce business. The success of these and other initiatives will depend on various factors, including the implementation of our strategy, the appeal of our store and website formats, our ability to offer new products to customers, our financial condition, our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences and competitive and economic conditions. We continuously endeavor to\nminimize our operating expenses, without adversely affecting the customer experience or the profitability of the business. If we fail to implement successfully some or all of our strategic initiatives, we may be unable to retain or attract customers, which could result in lower sales and a failure to realize the benefit of the expenditures incurred for these initiatives.\nIf we cannot increase profitability within existing stores or open new stores, our performance may be materially adversely affected.\nOur performance is dependent on maintaining and increasing sales in existing stores and the ability to successfully open profitable new stores. Increases in sales in existing stores are dependent on factors such as competition, merchandise selection, store operations (including maintaining and remodeling these stores) and other factors discussed in these Risk Factors. The success of any store depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where stores are located could decline in the future, potentially resulting in reduced sales in these locations.\nOur ability to successfully relocate or open new stores and expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors, which are in part beyond our control:\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient funds for the expansion;\n\u2022\nthe availability of attractive store locations and the ability to accurately assess the demographic or retail environment and customer demand at a given location;\n\u2022\nthe ability to negotiate favorable lease terms and obtain the necessary permits and zoning approvals;\n\u2022\nthe absence of occupancy delays;\n\u2022\nthe ability to construct, furnish and supply a store in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe ability to hire and train new personnel, especially store managers, in a cost effective manner; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nDelays or failures in successfully opening new stores, or achieving lower than expected sales in existing or new stores, could materially adversely affect our profitability. In addition, we may not be able to anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and, as a result, may not meet our targets for opening new stores or relocating stores or expanding profitably.\nSome of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Those markets may have different market conditions, consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new stores to be less successful than stores in our existing markets. Other new stores may be located in areas where we have existing stores. Although we have experience in these markets, increasing the number of locations may result in unanticipated over-saturation of markets and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores, thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance.\nThe success and expansion of our e-commerce business depends on our ability to successfully transition to an internally developed Domestic e-commerce platform and to provide quality service to our customers and if we are not able to provide such services, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are currently in the process of developing a new internal e-commerce platform for our Domestic website, which we now expect to launch in fiscal 2017. We may be faced with significant unforeseen transition challenges including additional implementation delays, cost overruns, technology interruptions and disruption of our distribution channels which could adversely affect our e-commerce platform. Any inability to successfully transition to, operate or maintain our internal platform or unforeseen transition operation challenges or disruptions may materially impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition and may materially adversely affect our ability to achieve future sales and profitability growth.\nAdditionally, our Internet operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which are in part beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure of our Internet service providers to perform their services properly and in a timely and efficient manner;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer willingness to purchase goods via the Internet;\n\u2022\nincreases in software filters that may inhibit our ability to market our products through e-mail messages to our customers and increases in consumer privacy concerns relating to the Internet;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable federal and state regulation, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and similar types of international laws;\n\u2022\nbreaches of Internet security including our new internal e-commerce platform;\n\u2022\nfailures in our Internet infrastructure or the failure of systems or third parties, such as telephone or electric power service, resulting in website downtime or other problems;\n\u2022\nfailure by us to process online customer orders properly and on time, which may negatively impact future online and in-store purchases by such customers;\n\u2022\nfailure by our service provider to provide warehousing and fulfillment services, which may negatively impact future online and in-store purchases by customers; and\n\u2022\nfailure to keep up with changes in technology.\nAs technology continues to advance, customers are increasingly using a variety of devices, such as computers, tablets and smartphones to shop online with us and our competitors. We continue to enhance our customers\u2019 shopping experience on each of these devices as well as incorporate social media as another means of communicating with our customers. If we fail to provide attractive, user-friendly online shopping platforms or fail to continually meet the evolving expectations of customers with developments in online merchandising technology and competitor offerings, we could be at a competitive disadvantage and our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur sales may be adversely affected if we fail to respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner.\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by fashion trends, perceived value and season. These fluctuations affect the merchandise in stock since purchase orders are written well in advance of the holiday season and, at times, before fashion trends and high-demand brands are evidenced by consumer purchases. If we overestimate the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories, which could result in increased expenses and reduced margins associated with having to liquidate obsolete inventory at lower prices or write it off. Conversely, if we underestimate the market for our products, we will miss opportunities for increased sales and profits, which would place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nSales of video games and video game systems are adversely affected by changing trends in the interactive entertainment industry including the rise in popularity of browser, mobile, tablet and social games distributed through alternative channels.\nSales of video games and video game systems, which have accounted for 4%, 4% and 6% of our annual Net sales for fiscals 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, have been impacted by trends in the interactive entertainment industry. Video games are now played on a wide variety of products, including mobile phones, tablets, social networking websites and other devices. The popularity of such non-traditional gaming has increased greatly and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile, tablet and social gaming is accessed through hardware other than the consoles and traditional hand-held video game devices we sell and its games are available through websites or proprietary app stores via direct online distribution at a fraction of the cost of console games. While we continue to develop and implement various strategies to incorporate these new trends into our offerings, including selling third party tablets and other devices, we can provide no assurances that these strategies will be successful or contribute to profitability. Similarly, a continued rise in the popularity of mobile and tablet gaming could negatively impact sales and profitability of traditional toys.\nThe decrease of birth rates in countries where we operate could negatively affect our business.\nMost of our end-customers are newborns and children and, as a result, our revenues are dependent on the birth rates in countries where we operate. In recent years, many countries\u2019 birth rates have dropped or stagnated as their population ages, and education and income levels increase. A continued and significant decline in the number of newborns and children in these countries could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nPotential changes to trade laws, regulations and policies, related to or restricting global trade, may negatively affect our business.\nThe result of the November 2016 presidential election in the United States has introduced the potential of a tax reform package which may include tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. We source a significant portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the United States, primarily in Asia. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe depend on key vendors to supply the merchandise that we sell to our customers and our vendors\u2019 failure to supply quality merchandise in a timely manner may damage our reputation and brands and harm our business.\nOur performance depends, in part, on our ability to purchase our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We purchase our merchandise from numerous international and domestic manufacturers and importers. We have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could change the terms under which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us at any time. We may not be able to purchase desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future. Better than expected sales demand may also lead to customer backorders and lower in-stock positions of our merchandise.\nIn fiscal 2016, we had 3,600 active vendor relationships through which we procure the merchandise that we offer to our customers. For fiscal 2016, our top 20 vendors worldwide, based on our purchase volume in USD, represented 43% of the total products we purchased. An inability to purchase suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of one or more key vendors could have a negative effect on our business and operating results and could cause us to miss products that we feel are important to our assortment. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and/or more expensive than those from existing vendors.\nIn addition, our vendors are subject to various risks, including raw material costs, inflation, labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, product merchantability, inclement weather, natural disasters and general economic and political conditions that could limit our vendors\u2019 ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely basis and at prices and payment terms that are commercially acceptable. For these or other reasons, one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our quality control standards, and we might not identify the deficiency before merchandise ships to our stores or customers. In addition, our vendors may have difficulty adjusting to our changing demands and growing business. Our vendors\u2019 failure to manufacture or import quality merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brands, and could lead to an increase in customer litigation against us and an increase in our routine and non-routine litigation costs. Further, any merchandise that does not meet our quality standards could become subject to a recall, which could damage our brand reputation and harm our business.\nIf our vendors fail to provide promotional support consistent with past levels, our sales, earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nOur vendors typically provide us with promotional support for the sale of their products in our stores and on our websites, including allowances for volume-related purchases. As part of this support, we receive allowances, payments and credits from the vendors which reduce our cost of goods sold, support the promotion and merchandising of the products we sell and drive sales at our stores and on our websites. We cannot provide assurance that vendors will continue to provide this support consistent with past levels. If our vendors fail to do so, our sales, earnings and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to protect the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 information, or if our information technology systems, including our new internal e-commerce platform, fail to perform adequately.\nA compromise of our security systems (or a design flaw in our system environment) could result in unauthorized access to certain personal information about our employees or customers (including credit card and gift registry information) which could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, and thus affect our sales and profitability. Other sophisticated retailers have recently suffered serious security breaches. A serious breach could negatively impact our operations, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems. Such risks may be difficult to adequately insure against or insurance may be costly.\nWe depend largely upon our information technology systems in the conduct of all aspects of our operations. If our information technology systems, including our new internal e-commerce platform, fail to perform as anticipated, or should we experience any delays or difficulties in transitioning to these or other new systems, or integrating these systems with our current systems, we could experience difficulties in virtually any area of our operations, including but not limited to replenishing inventories or in delivering our products to store locations and customers. Any of these or other systems-related problems could, in turn, materially adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe have substantial obligations under long-term leases that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we leased 1,383 of our properties from third-parties pursuant to long-term space and ground leases. Total rent expense, net of sublease income, was $524 million, $546 million and $601 million for fiscals 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is expected to be approximately $495 million for fiscal 2017. Many of our leases provide for scheduled\nincreases in rent. The substantial obligations under our leases could further exacerbate the risks described below under \u201cOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or refinance our maturing debt, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industries, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our various debt instruments.\u201d\nIf we are unable to renew or replace our current store leases or if we are unable to enter into leases for additional stores on favorable terms, or if one or more of our current leases are terminated prior to expiration of their stated term and we cannot find suitable alternate locations, our growth and profitability could be negatively impacted.\nWe currently have ground leasehold interests in 14% and long-term space leasehold interests in 65% of our domestic and international store locations. Most of our current leases provide for our unilateral option to renew for several additional periods at specific rental rates. Our ability to re-negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms for a suitable alternate location or for additional store locations could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and prospective landlords or may depend on other factors that are not within our control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively impact our growth and profitability.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks arising from the international scope of our operations which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States. For fiscals 2016, 2015 and 2014, 38%, 38% and 39% of our Net sales, respectively, were generated outside the United States. In addition, as of January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, 33% and 32% of our long-lived assets, respectively, were located outside of the United States. Weakened global economic conditions, particularly the weakened and unstable environment in parts of Europe and Asia, could continue to affect us through lower sales as a result of reduced demand and the effects of foreign currency translation. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including the challenges of different economic conditions in each of the countries, possible nationalization or expropriation, price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies as described below, limited protection of intellectual property in certain jurisdictions, political instability and restrictive governmental actions.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a variety of international suppliers, with China being a significant source. Additionally, a growing portion of our stores are located in China and as a consequence, our financial results are expected to become increasingly affected by our results in China, and our business is increasingly exposed to risks there. Political or financial instability, trade restrictions, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and/or materially adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, changes in the costs of procuring raw materials used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain, including labor, fuel, tariffs, and currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on gross margin, expenses and results of operations.\nIn addition, any significant or prolonged deterioration in US - China relations could adversely affect our China business. Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within China. There are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in China.\nOur business is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and such fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExchange rate fluctuations may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flow associated with our international operations, as well as the translation of net asset or liability positions that are denominated in foreign currencies. In countries outside of the United States where we operate stores, we generate revenues and incur operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses denominated in local currencies. In many countries where we do not operate stores, our licensees pay royalties in USD. However, as the royalties are calculated based on local currency sales, our revenues are still impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. In fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, 38%, 38% and 39% of our Net sales, respectively, were transacted in a currency other than the USD, the majority of which were denominated in yen, Euros, Canadian dollars and pounds. In fiscal 2016, our reported operating earnings would have decreased or increased $32 million if all foreign currencies uniformly weakened or strengthened by an incremental 10% relative to the USD.\nWe enter into foreign exchange agreements from time to time with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates referred to as hedging activities. However, these hedging activities may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own. Although we hedge some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInternational events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our stores, which could negatively affect our sales and profitability.\nA significant portion of products we sell are manufactured outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including labor strikes, work stoppages, boycotts, safety issues on materials, the imposition of trade restrictions in the form of tariffs, embargoes or export controls, \u201canti-dumping\u201d duties, port security or other events that could slow port activities, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us. In addition, port-labor issues, rail congestion and trucking shortages can have an impact on all direct importers. Although we attempt to anticipate and manage such situations, both our sales and profitability could be materially adversely impacted by any such developments in the future.\nOur results may be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in raw material and energy costs.\nOur results may be affected by the prices of the components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our toys and baby products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including: oil prices, changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, currency exchange rates and government regulation. In addition, energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and overall costs to purchase products from our vendors.\nWe may not be able to adjust the prices of our products, especially in the short-term, to recover these cost increases in raw materials and energy. A continual rise in raw material and energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor shortages and increases in hourly wage rates could restrict our ability to operate our stores, grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could reduce our profits.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled employees. If we are unable to do so, our ability to adequately manage and staff our stores could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction and sales. Staffing shortages also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses. Payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our stores. A shortage of skilled labor could require higher wages that would increase labor costs, which could adversely affect our profits. In addition, our hourly wage may increase as a result of market pressure and the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that Congress will increase the federal minimum wage. Increases in hourly wage rates could have a material adverse effect on our costs and profitability.\nA significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.\nWe rely on our ability to replenish depleted inventory in our stores through deliveries to our distribution centers from vendors and then from our distribution centers or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, rail, air and truck. We rely on various third-party vendors to manage services related to the delivery of inventory from distribution centers to our stores. Unexpected delays in deliveries or increases in transportation costs (including from increased fuel costs) could significantly decrease our ability to generate sales and earn profits. In addition, labor shortages or labor disagreements in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.\nProduct safety issues, including product recalls, could harm our reputation, divert resources, reduce sales and increase costs.\nThe products we sell in our stores are subject to regulation by the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state and international regulatory authorities. As a result, such products have been and could be in the future subject to recalls and other remedial actions. Product safety concerns may require us to voluntarily remove selected products from our stores.\nSuch recalls and voluntary removal of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business exposes us to personal injury and product liability claims which could result in adverse publicity and harm to our brands and our results of operations.\nWe are from time to time subject to claims due to the injury of an individual in our stores or on our property. In addition, we have in the past been subject to product liability claims for the products that we sell. Subject to certain exceptions, our purchase orders generally require the manufacturer to indemnify us against any product liability claims; however, if the manufacturer does not have insurance or becomes insolvent, there is a risk we would not be indemnified. Any personal injury or product liability claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend, resulting in adverse publicity, or damage to our reputation, and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe are involved in private actions, investigations and various other legal proceedings by employees, suppliers, competitors, government agencies or others. The results of such litigation, investigations and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time and divert significant resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, we could be exposed to monetary damages or limits on our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is great uncertainty regarding the cost of healthcare which could have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nU.S. healthcare legislation has impacted our healthcare cost structure and it may, over time, increase our employee healthcare related expenses. Further regulatory action is expected as a result of the recent presidential election. Such action could result in changes to healthcare eligibility, design and cost structure that could have an impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain regulatory and legal requirements. If we fail to comply with regulatory or legal requirements, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to numerous regulatory and legal requirements. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Federal Trade Commission, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC. In addition, our business activities require us to comply with complex regulatory and legal issues on a local, national and worldwide basis (including, in some cases, more stringent local labor laws or regulations). Future legislative and regulatory actions relating to credit cards could also have an adverse impact on our credit card program and our sales. Additionally, we may be subject to new disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new state or federal laws. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations, involve significant expense, and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters, which in turn could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, inclement weather, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events could cause permanent or temporary distribution center or store closures, impair our ability to purchase, receive or replenish inventory, or decrease customer traffic, all of which could result in lost sales and otherwise materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and volcano eruptions, or inclement weather such as frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms, or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures, or the occurrence of pandemic outbreaks, labor strikes, work stoppages, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which we operate stores or our suppliers are located, or similar disruptions could materially adversely affect our operations and financial performance. To the extent these events impact one or more of our key vendors or result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers or a significant number of stores, our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries to our stores and through lost sales. In addition, these events could result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, delays in opening new stores, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas vendors, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, the temporary reduction in the availability of\nproducts in our stores and disruption to our information systems. These events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\nOur results of operations could suffer if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain experienced senior management for our business.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals, or the inability to attract and retain qualified individuals for key management positions, could harm our business and financial performance.\nWe utilize outsourcing arrangements for certain financial and other functions. By relying on third-party service providers we may come across unexpected obstacles that can disrupt our business operations.\nWe have outsourced certain financial and other functions to third-party service providers to achieve further operating efficiencies. Inadequate management or training of these providers can lead to lack of proper skill sets to effectively manage and execute the applicable processes. In addition, we are at risk of data security, losing visibility and control of the applicable processes and potential language barriers. If we do not effectively manage outsourcing relationships, if third-party providers do not perform efficiently or in a timely manner, or if we experience problems with transitioning the work to a third party, we may experience disruptions in transaction processing or information technology services all of which can negatively impact our business processes, reputation and customers.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of international and domestic tax audits. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in tax laws, changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, changes to existing accounting rules or regulations, or by changes to our ownership or capital structures. Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact our future results of operations. New accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) released new accounting rules, effective fiscal 2019, requiring companies to capitalize substantially all leases, including operating leases, in their financial statements. This change will require us to record a significant amount of lease related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. These and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations may materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of property and equipment. Changes to estimates or projections related to such assets, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain store locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include a substantial amount of property and equipment, in addition to goodwill. We make certain estimates and projections in connection with impairment analyses for these assets, in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 360, \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d (\u201cASC 360\u201d), and ASC Topic 350, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d (\u201cASC 350\u201d). We review the carrying value of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360 or ASC 350. We will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. These calculations require us to make a number of estimates and projections of future results. If these estimates or projections change, we may be required to record additional impairment charges on certain of these assets. If these impairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may from time to time pursue acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, as could the integration of the businesses following acquisition.\nWe may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses. Acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our Company,\nwhich may result in the diversion of our capital and our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, technology, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures. We cannot provide assurance that any acquisition we make will be successful and our operating results may be adversely impacted by the integration of a new business and its financial results.\nThe Sponsors control us and may have conflicts of interest with us.\nInvestment funds or groups advised by or affiliated with the Sponsors currently control us through their ownership of 98% of our voting common stock. As a result, the Sponsors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders. In addition, the Sponsors may have an interest in pursuing dispositions, acquisitions, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us as a company.\nThe Sponsors may direct us to make significant changes to our business operations and strategy, including with respect to, among other things, store openings and closings, new product and service offerings, sales of real estate and other assets, employee headcount levels and initiatives to reduce costs and expenses. We cannot provide assurance that our future business operations will remain broadly in line with our existing operations or that significant real estate and other assets will not be sold.\nThe Sponsors are also in the business of making investments for their own accounts in companies, and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or more of the Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as investment funds associated with or designated by the Sponsors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or refinance our maturing debt, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our various debt instruments.\nWe are, and we expect to continue to be, highly leveraged. As of January 28, 2017, our total indebtedness was $4.8 billion, of which $3.4 billion was secured indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have significant consequences, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operating activities to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and as a result, reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund our operations and capital expenditures, capitalize on future business opportunities, expand our business and execute our strategy;\n\u2022\nincreasing the difficulty for us to make scheduled payments on our outstanding debt and other obligations, as our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our debt service obligations;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest expense due to changes in borrowing spreads and short-term interest rates;\n\u2022\ncausing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and general, corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and reacting to competitive pressure, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less leveraged.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including under our current outstanding credit facilities. Although our indentures, credit agreements and documents governing our other indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing global economic and market conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may from time to time prepay, repurchase, refinance or otherwise acquire debt or debt securities issued by us or our subsidiaries in open market transactions, tender offers, exchange offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such exchanges or refinancings may include the issuance or guarantee of debt by certain of our subsidiaries, and may be accompanied by transactions or asset transfers among certain of our subsidiaries. Any debt issued in such transactions may be issued or guaranteed by entities that are not obligors on the debt being refinanced, and may have liens on assets that are not pledged to secure the debt being refinanced. Any such transactions, and the amounts involved, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Even if we were able to refinance or obtain additional financing, the costs of new indebtedness could be substantially higher than the costs of our existing indebtedness.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we had approximately $446 million of final debt maturities within two years. We believe we will have the ability to refinance, or repay a portion and refinance the balance of, this debt prior to their respective maturity dates; however, a number of factors including factors beyond our control could reduce or restrict our ability to refinance these debt obligations on favorable terms.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity problems, and we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt obligations. If we were unable to repay amounts when due, the holders of our debt could proceed against the issuers or guarantors of that debt, and the collateral granted to them to secure that debt, if any. Additionally, a failure to repay amounts when due under certain debt will likely constitute an event of default and entitle the holders of other debt to accelerate or otherwise proceed against the issuers or guarantors of such debt.\nOur debt agreements contain covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nToys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc. is a holding company and conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, certain of which have incurred their own indebtedness. As specified in certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements, there are restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends, loans or advances. The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, and may materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and refinance our indebtedness. Among other things, these covenants limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur certain additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ntransfer assets between and among Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc. and our various subsidiaries;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions with respect to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nissue stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, loans or advances;\n\u2022\ntransfer and sell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate or permit liens on assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\namend certain documents.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in default under one or more of our debt agreements, which could prompt the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our debt agreements to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, our secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders under the debt agreements accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient assets and funds to repay the borrowings under our debt agreements.", "PERMNO": 61065, "SIC": 5945, "TIC": "1231B"}
