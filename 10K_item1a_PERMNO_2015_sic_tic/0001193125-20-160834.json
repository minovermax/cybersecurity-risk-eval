RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. The risks described herein are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIf we are unable to retain our existing customers or attract new customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends substantially upon the retention of existing customers and the attraction of new customers. We may not be able to retain our existing customers or attract new customers if we are unable to provide solutions or services that existing or prospective payer customers believe enable them to achieve improved efficiencies and cost-effectiveness or allow them to more effectively manage their revenue cycle, increase reimbursement rates and improve cash flows.\nSuccess in retaining and attracting customers will also depend, in part, on our ability to innovate successfully and be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models.\nTo remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) markets, we must continuously upgrade our existing solutions and develop and introduce new solutions on a timely basis. Future advances in healthcare IT could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with existing solutions, resulting in pricing pressure or rendering such solutions obsolete or not competitive. In addition, because we deliver enterprise-wide and single entity clinical, patient care, financial, imaging, supply chain and strategic management software solutions to payers, hospitals, physicians and other providers, our ability to integrate these software solutions could be challenged, which may impair our ability to retain customers and harm our reputation with existing and prospective customers. We also may not be able to retain or attract customers if our solutions contain errors or otherwise fail to perform properly, if our pricing structure is not competitive or if we are unable to renegotiate customer contracts upon expiration.\nOur revenue depends in part upon maintaining high customer retention rates and our future growth depends on attracting new customers. If we are unable to maintain customer retention rates, or to attract new customers, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nAn economic downturn or volatility like we are currently experiencing due to COVID-19 could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe U.S. and world economies have experienced significant economic uncertainty and volatility during recent years and that uncertainty has become more acute in the last several months as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A weakening of economic conditions has led to reductions in demand for our solutions. As a result of volatile or uncertain economic conditions, we may experience the negative effects of increased financial pressures on payer and provider customers. For instance, our business has been and is likely to continue to be negatively impacted by increased competitive pricing pressure and a decline in our customers\u2019 creditworthiness, which could result in us incurring increased bad debt expense. Additionally, volatile or uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. and other parts of the world could lead government customers to terminate, or elect not to renew, existing contracts with us, or not enter into new contracts with us. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the current weak economic environment, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business has been and continues to be negatively affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may face similar impacts from any future outbreaks of disease.\nOur operations have and continue to be affected by the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (the \u201cWHO\u201d) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. On March 13, 2020, President Trump declared a National Emergency relating to the disease. The widespread infection in the U.S. and abroad has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets, which could result in a prolonged economic downturn that has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business.\nWhile national, state and local quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew and similar isolation measures have begun to ease, such government orders and other restrictions may continue in effect or may be reinstituted if outbreaks increase or fail to decrease. Such measures have had adverse impacts on the U.S. and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration and have and may continue to negatively impact our ongoing operations, including our revenue and supply chain. For example, a portion of our business is tied to overall volumes of activity in the healthcare system, and as a result of the significant reduction, or in some cases elimination, of elective medical procedures and healthcare visits, without a corresponding increase in COVID-19 related transactions, we have seen a significant temporary decline in transactions across our medical and dental networks. In addition, for a portion of our technology-enabled services business we get paid on a contingency basis based on collections, which has also been impacted by a delay in elective procedures.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, we and several of our business partners have transitioned the majority of our workforce to a temporary remote working model, which may result in us experiencing lower work efficiency and productivity, which in turn may adversely affect our business. As our employees and business partners\u2019 employees work from home and access our system remotely, we may be subject to heightened security and privacy risks, including the risks of cyber attacks and privacy incidents. Additionally, we have a limited number of employees who continue to work in our facilities or perform services at our customers\u2019 facilities who may be subject to heightened risks for COVID-19 exposure thus potentially impacting their health and future worker compensation claims against us. We may also be subject to lawsuits from employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at our facilities, which could involve large demands and substantial defense costs. Our professional and general liability insurance may not cover all claims against us. Furthermore, if any of our employees are unable to perform his or her duties for a period of time, including as the result of illness, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. Finally, the widespread pandemic has caused and is expected to continue to cause significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce or impair our ability to access capital (or access capital on reasonable terms) temporarily during this period.\nWhile the COVID-19 outbreak may provide us with new business opportunities, including supporting customers offering novel telemedicine, telehealth, and data and analytics products and solutions, we may experience compliance and related business development risks associated with these new business opportunities if customers request, and we attempt to offer, these products and solutions on an expedited basis in support of COVID-19 efforts.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related response, including the length of time it may take for normal economic and operating conditions to resume or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact our business, consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, operations, financial position or consolidated cash flows, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nIf we are unable to connect to a large number of payers and providers, our solutions would be limited and less desirable to customers.\nOur business largely depends upon our ability to connect electronically to a substantial number of payers, such as insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid agencies and pharmacy benefit managers and\nadministrators, and providers, such as hospitals, physicians, clinics, dentists, laboratories and pharmacies. The attractiveness of some of the solutions we offer to providers, such as claims management and submission services, depends in part on our ability to connect to a large number of payers, which allows it to streamline and simplify workflows for providers. These connections may be made either directly or through a clearinghouse. We may not be able to maintain our connections with a large number of payers on satisfactory terms and may not be able to develop new connections, either directly or through other clearinghouses, on satisfactory terms. The failure to maintain these connections could cause our solutions to be less attractive to provider customers. In addition, payer customers view our relationships with providers as desirable in allowing them to receive a high volume of transactions electronically and realize the resulting cost efficiencies through the use of our solutions. Competing EDI service providers can easily establish connections with payers and providers and thereby may replicate these solutions. Any failure to maintain existing connections with payers, providers and other clearinghouses or to develop new connections as circumstances warrant, or an increase in the utilization of direct links between payers and providers, could cause our electronic transaction processing systems to be less desirable to healthcare constituents, which would reduce the number of transactions that we process, which would reduce our revenue and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face significant competition, which may harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe face substantial competition from many healthcare information systems companies and other IT companies, including the growing presence of large technology companies entering the healthcare market. This vigorous competition requires us to provide high quality, innovative products at a competitive price. These competitive threats will likely remain or expand in the future. Our key competitors include:\n\u2022\nhealthcare transaction processing companies, including those providing electronic data interchange (\u201cEDI\u201d) services and/or internet-based services and those providing services through other means, such as paper and fax;\n\u2022\nhealthcare information system vendors that support providers or payers with their revenue and payment cycle management, imaging usage, retrieval and management, capacity and resource management, and clinical information exchange processes, including physician and dental practice management, hospital information, imaging and workflow solutions and Electronic Health Records (\u201cEHR\u201d) vendors;\n\u2022\nIT and healthcare consulting service providers;\n\u2022\nhealthcare insurance companies, pharmacy benefit management and pharmacy benefit administrator companies, hospital management companies and pharmacies that provide or are developing electronic transaction and payment distribution services for use by providers and/or by their members and customers;\n\u2022\nhealthcare payments and communication solutions providers, including financial institutions and payment processors that have invested in healthcare data management assets, and print and mail vendors;\n\u2022\nhealthcare eligibility and enrollment services companies;\n\u2022\nhealthcare payment accuracy companies;\n\u2022\nhealthcare engagement and transparency companies;\n\u2022\nhealthcare billing and coding services companies;\n\u2022\nproviders of other data products and data analytics solutions, including healthcare risk adjustment, quality, economic statistics and other data; and\n\u2022\nlicensors of de-identified healthcare information.\nIn addition, the increasing standardization of certain healthcare IT products and services has made it easier for companies to enter these markets with competitive products and services. Many software, hardware,\ninformation systems and business process outsourcing companies, both with and without healthcare companies as their partners, offer or have announced their intention to offer products or services that are competitive with solutions that we offer. There have been a number of recent entrants that have successfully marketed competitive solutions and they may expand these offerings in the future. We cannot fully anticipate whether or when companies in adjacent or other product, service or technology areas may launch competitive products, and any such entry may lead to product obsolescence, loss of market share or erosion of prices. The extent of this competition varies by the size of companies, geographical coverage and scope and breadth of products and services offered. Within certain of the markets in which we operate, our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial or other resources and have established reputations for success. In addition, many of the world\u2019s largest and most well-funded technology companies are aggressively pursuing opportunities to enter the healthcare market, and we expect such initiatives to accelerate in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, the pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid, and there are frequent new solution introductions, solution enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to upgrade our existing solutions or services, or introduce new solutions or services at the same rate as our competitors, or at all, nor can it guarantee that such upgrades or new solutions or services will achieve market acceptance over or among competitive offerings, or at all. Competitors may also commercialize products, services or technologies that render our solutions obsolete or less marketable.\nThese competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCompetition with some customers, or decisions by customers to perform internally some of the same solutions or services that we offer, could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nSome of our existing customers compete with us, or may do so in the future, and some customers belong to alliances that compete with us, or may do so in the future, either with respect to the solutions or services we provide to them now, or with respect to other lines of business. For example, some payer customers currently offer, through affiliated clearinghouses, web portals and other means, electronic data transmission services to providers that allow the provider to bypass third-party EDI service providers such as us, and additional payers may do so in the future. The ability of payers to replicate these solutions and the ability of providers to connect directly with payers may adversely affect the terms and conditions we are able to negotiate in our agreements with payers and our transaction volume with them, which directly relates to our revenue. In addition, to the extent that customers elect to perform internally any of the business processes our solutions address, either because they believe they can provide such processes more efficiently internally or otherwise, we may lose such customers, or the volume of our business with such customers may be reduced, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. Many healthcare organizations, including a number of our customers, have consolidated to create larger enterprises with greater market power. This consolidation trend could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to downward price pressure on our solutions or services, or less demand for them, or both. In addition, when our customers combine, they often consolidate infrastructure including IT systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base. Any of these effects could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf our solutions do not interoperate with our customers\u2019 or their vendors\u2019 networks and infrastructures, or if customers or their vendors implement new system updates that are incompatible with our solutions, sales of those solutions could be adversely affected.\nOur solutions must interoperate with our customers\u2019 and their vendors\u2019 existing infrastructures, which often have different specifications, rapidly evolve, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products and applications\nfrom multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that have been added to that infrastructure over time. Some of the technologies supporting our customers and their vendors are changing rapidly and we must continue to adapt to these changes in a timely and effective manner at an acceptable cost. In addition, our customers and their vendors may implement new technologies into their existing networks and systems infrastructures that may not immediately interoperate with our solutions. our continued success will depend on our ability to adapt to changing technologies, manage and process ever-increasing amounts of data and information and improve the performance, features and reliability of our services in response to changing customer and industry demands. If we encounter complications related to network configurations or settings, we may have to modify our solutions to enable them to interoperate with customers\u2019 and their vendors\u2019 networks and manage customers\u2019 transactions in the manner intended. For example, if customers or their vendors implement new encryption protocols, it may be necessary for us to obtain a license to implement or interoperate with such protocols, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a license on acceptable terms, if at all. These difficulties, and other difficulties we may experience, could delay or prevent the successful design, development, testing, introduction or marketing of our solutions. As a consequence of any of the foregoing, our ability to sell our solutions may be impaired, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to maintain relationships with channel partners or significant changes in the terms of agreements with channel partners may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully market our solutions.\nWe have entered into contracts with channel partners to market and sell some of our solutions. Most of these contracts are on a non-exclusive basis. However, under contracts with some channel partners, we may be bound by provisions that restrict our ability to market and sell solutions to potential customers. Our arrangements with some of these channel partners involve negotiated payments to them based on percentages of revenue they generate. If the payments prove to be too high, we may be unable to realize acceptable margins, but if the payments prove to be too low, channel partners may not be motivated to produce a sufficient volume of revenue. The success of these partnerships will depend in part upon the channel partners\u2019 own competitive, marketing and strategic considerations, including the relative advantages of using alternative solutions being developed and marketed by them or by competitors. If any of these channel partners is unsuccessful in marketing our solutions or seeks to amend the financial or other terms of the contracts they have with us may need to broaden our marketing efforts to increase focus on the solutions they sell and alter our distribution strategy, which may divert planned efforts and resources from other projects and increase our costs generally. In addition, as part of the packages these channel partners sell, they may offer a choice to their customers between solutions what we supply and similar solutions offered by competitors or by the channel partners directly. If our solutions are not chosen for inclusion in these packages, the revenue we earn from our channel partner relationships will decrease. Lastly, we could be subject to claims and liability as a result of the activities, products or services of these channel partners or other resellers of our solutions. Even if these claims do not result in liability, investigating and defending these claims could be expensive, time-consuming and result in adverse publicity that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe have faced and will continue to face pressure to reduce prices, which may reduce our margins, profitability and competitive position.\nAs electronic transaction processing has further penetrated the healthcare market and has become highly standardized, competition among revenue cycle management software and EDI providers is increasingly focused on providing value added services and capabilities to customers. This competition has placed pressure, and could place further pressure, on us to add functionality and keep prices competitive in order to retain market share. Likewise, as a result of Medicare or Medicaid payment reductions and other reimbursement changes, our provider customers have sought, and may attempt in the future to seek, price concessions. If we are unable to reduce costs sufficiently to offset declines in prices, or if we are unable to introduce new, innovative offerings with higher margins, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely impacted.\nIn addition, many healthcare industry constituents are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. As provider networks, such as hospitals, and payer organizations, such as private insurance companies, consolidate, competition to provide the types of solutions we provide may become more intense and the importance of establishing and maintaining relationships with key healthcare industry constituents could increase. These healthcare industry constituents have used in the past, and likely will try to use in the future, their market power-particularly where it has been increased following mergers and consolidations-to negotiate price reductions for our solutions. If we are forced to further reduce prices, margins will decrease and results of operations could deteriorate, unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in expenses.\nWe are highly dependent on transaction volumes in the U.S. healthcare industry, particularly payment and reimbursement transaction volumes, and any temporary or sustained decrease in healthcare transaction, payment or reimbursement volumes in the U.S. could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue attributable to the ongoing use of or subscription to a service or solution after an initial sale or renewal without additional selling efforts is earned on a per transaction basis (or is derived from transaction-related services). As a result, much of our revenue is tied to customer transaction, payment and reimbursement volumes and generally is not contractually required to be paid in the absence of the occurrence of healthcare transactions, which themselves are not subject to any minimum or other similar volume requirements under customer contracts. In addition, some contracts with customers generally can be terminated or not renewed without penalty and on little or no advance notice. As a result, this \u201crecurring\u201d revenue is highly dependent on us maintaining our customer base as well as on the transaction volume generally in the U.S. healthcare industry since such revenue directly correlates with healthcare transaction, payment and reimbursement volumes in the U.S. For example, in the U.S. our revenue can be adversely affected by the impact of lower healthcare utilization trends currently being driven by COVID-19 and likely to continue to be driven by higher unemployment and other negative economic factors. Further, weakened economic conditions or a recession could reduce the amounts patients are willing or able to spend on healthcare services. As a result, patients may elect to delay or forgo seeking healthcare services and recent increases in unemployment rates are likely to cause commercial payer membership to decline, which could further reduce healthcare utilization and transaction volumes. In addition, such events could decrease payer or provider demand for our solutions, which could further adversely impact revenue, including \u201crecurring\u201d revenue.\nVarious factors may cause continued temporary or sustained disruption to U.S. healthcare transaction volumes. The impact such disruptions would have on our business will depend upon the magnitude and duration of any such disruption. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe financial stability of customers and the U.S. healthcare industry generally, and the impact of any fundamental corporate changes to healthcare providers and payers, such as hospital and insurance consolidations, on the cost and availability of, and the rate of reimbursement for, healthcare services, including due to the aftermath of COVID-19;\n\u2022\npolitical, legislative, regulatory and other changes in how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed, including any future changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d), Medicare, Medicaid and other federal, state and local healthcare regulations, as well as any future changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nfactors that may affect demand for healthcare services, such as high unemployment, rising healthcare costs and increased copayment requirements; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAny temporary or sustained decrease in healthcare transaction, payment or reimbursement volumes in the U.S. could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to generate revenue could suffer if we do not continue to update and improve existing solutions and develop new ones.\nWe must continually improve the functionality of our existing solutions in a timely manner and introduce new and valuable healthcare IT and service solutions in order to respond to technological and regulatory developments and customer demands and, thereby, retain existing customers and attract new ones. For example, from time to time, government agencies may alter format and data code requirements applicable to electronic transactions. In addition, customers may request that solutions be customized to satisfy particular security protocols, modifications and other contractual terms in excess of industry norms and standard configurations. We may not be successful in responding to technological and regulatory developments or changing customer needs. In addition, these regulatory or customer-imposed requirements may impact the profitability of particular solutions and customer engagements. The pace of change in the markets served by us is rapid, and there are frequent new product and service introductions by competitors and channel partners who use our solutions in their offerings. If we do not respond successfully to technological and regulatory changes, as well as evolving industry standards and customer demands, our solutions may become obsolete. Technological changes also may result in the offering of competitive solutions at lower prices than we are charging for our solutions, which could result in us losing sales unless we lower the prices we charge or provide additional efficiencies or capabilities to the customer. If we lower our prices on some of our solutions, we will need to increase margins on other solutions in order to maintain overall profitability.\nAchieving market acceptance of new or updated solutions is necessary in order for them to become profitable and will likely require significant efforts and expenditures.\nOur future financial results will depend in part on whether new or updated solutions receive sufficient customer acceptance. Achieving market acceptance for new or updated solutions is likely to require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by existing or prospective customers. In addition, deployment of new or updated solutions may require the use of additional resources for training existing sales force and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional salespersons and customer service personnel. Failure to achieve broad penetration in target markets with respect to new or updated solutions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business would be adversely affected if we cannot obtain, process or distribute the highly regulated data we require to provide our solutions.\nOur business relies on our ability to obtain, process, monetize and distribute highly regulated data in the healthcare industry and in other industries, in a manner that complies with applicable laws, regulations and contractual and technological restrictions. The failure of either us or our data suppliers and processors to obtain such data in a compliant manner could have a harmful effect on our ability to use and disclose such data which in turn could impair our functions and operations, including our ability to share such data with third parties or incorporate it into our services and offerings. In addition to complying with requirements in obtaining the data, the use, processing and distribution of such data may require us or our data suppliers and processors to obtain consent from third parties or follow additional laws, regulations or contractual and technological restrictions that apply to the healthcare industry and other industries. These requirements could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us. Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice, permission or waiver. We have policies and procedures in place addressing the proper handling and use of data, but could face claims that our data practices may occur in a manner not permitted under applicable laws or our agreements with or obligations to data providers, individuals or other third parties, as more specifically described below. These\nclaims or liabilities and other failures to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nThere are increased risks of performance problems and breaches during times when we are making significant changes to our solutions or systems we use to provide our solutions. In addition, changes to our solutions or systems, including cost savings initiatives, may cost more than anticipated, may not provide the benefits expected, may take longer than anticipated to develop and implement or may increase the risk of performance problems.\nIn order to respond to technological changes, such as continuing development in the areas of data analytics, ML, AI and blockchain, among others, as well as regulatory changes and evolving security risks and industry standards, our solutions and the software and systems we use to provide our solutions must be continually updated and enhanced. Because some of the software and systems that we use to provide solutions to customers are inherently complex, changing, updating, enhancing or creating new versions of our solutions or the software or systems we use to provide our solutions introduces a risk of errors or performance problems, despite testing and quality control. We cannot be certain that errors will not arise in connection with any such changes, updates, enhancements or new versions, especially when first introduced. Even if our new, updated or enhanced solutions do not have performance problems, technical and customer service personnel may have difficulties installing them or providing any necessary training and support to customers, and customers may not follow our guidance on appropriate training, support and implementation for such new, updated or enhanced solutions. In addition, changes in technology and systems may not provide the additional functionality or other benefits that were expected.\nImplementation of changes in our technology and systems may cost more or take longer than originally expected and may require more testing than initially anticipated. While new, updated or enhanced solutions will be tested before they are used in production, we cannot be sure that the testing will uncover all problems that may occur in actual use.\nWe also periodically implement efficiency measures and other cost-saving initiatives to improve our operating performance. These efficiency measures and other cost-saving initiatives may not provide the benefits anticipated or do so in the expected time frame. Implementation of these measures may also increase the risk of performance issues due to unforeseen impacts on our organization, systems and processes.\nIf significant problems occur as a result of these changes, we may fail to meet our contractual obligations to customers, which could result in claims being made against us or in the loss of customer relationships.\nBreaches and failures of our IT systems and the security measures protecting them, and the sensitive information we transmit, use and store, expose us to potential liability and reputational harm.\nOur business relies on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data, affecting our ability to manufacture, purchase, distribute, and process products and services. To the extent our IT systems are not successfully implemented or fail, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a vendor servicing our IT systems does not perform satisfactorily, or if the IT systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events, including the actions of third parties. Further, our business relies to a significant degree upon the secure transmission, use and storage of sensitive information, including protected health information and other personally identifiable information, financial information and other confidential information and data within these systems.\nTo protect this information, we seek to implement commercially reasonable security measures and maintain information security policies and procedures informed by requirements under applicable law and recommended practices, in each case, as applicable to the data collected, hosted and processed. Despite our security\nmanagement efforts with respect to physical and technological infrastructure, employee training, vendor (and sub-vendor) controls and contractual relationships, our infrastructure, data or other operation centers and systems used in connection with our business operations, including the internet and related systems of our vendors (including vendors to which we outsource data hosting, storage and processing functions) are vulnerable to, and from time to time experience, unauthorized access to data and/or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct, physical break-ins, hackers, employee or insider malfeasance and/or improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware events, phishing schemes, fraud, terrorist attacks, human error or other breaches by insiders or third parties or similar disruptive problems. It is not possible to prevent all security threats to our systems and data. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Further, defects in the design or manufacture of the hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties could compromise our IT systems. These events, including unauthorized access, misappropriation, disclosure or loss of sensitive information (including financial or personal health information) or a significant disruption of our network, expose us to risks including risks to our ability to provide our solutions and fulfill contractual demands, management distraction and the obligation to devote significant financial and other resources to mitigate such problems and increases to our future information security costs, including through organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, further training of employees, changing vendor (and sub-vendor) control practices, and engaging third-party experts and consultants. Moreover, unauthorized access, use or disclosure of certain sensitive information in our possession or our failure to satisfy legal requirements, including requirements relating to safeguarding protected health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and personal information under the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d)\u2019s General Data Protection Regulations (\u201cGDPR\u201d) or state data privacy laws, as discussed further below, could result in civil and criminal liability and regulatory action, which could result in potential fines and penalties, as well as costs relating to investigation of an incident or breach, corrective actions, required notifications to regulatory agencies and customers, credit monitoring services and other necessary expenses. In addition, actual or perceived breaches of our security management efforts can cause existing customers to terminate their relationship with us and deter existing or prospective customers from using or purchasing our solutions in the future. These events can have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nBecause our products and services involve the storage, use and transmission of personal information of consumers, we and other industry participants have been and expect to routinely be the target of attempted cyber and other security threats by outside third parties, including technically sophisticated and well-resourced bad actors attempting to access or steal the data we store. Vendor, insider or employee cyber and security threats also occur and are a significant concern for all companies, including us. Recently, there have been a number of high profile security breaches involving the improper dissemination of personal information of individuals both within and outside of the healthcare industry. These breaches have resulted in lawsuits and governmental enforcement actions that have sought or obtained significant fines and penalties, and have required companies to enter into agreements with government regulators that impose ongoing obligations and requirements, including internal and external (third party) monitorships for five years or more. While we maintain liability insurance coverage including coverage for errors and omissions and cyber-liability, claims may not be covered or could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or such coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts.\nIf we are unable to successfully expand our sales force productivity, and execute on cross-selling opportunities, sales of our solutions and the growth of our business and financial performance could be harmed.\nWe continue to invest significantly in our sales force to obtain new customers and increase sales to existing customers. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified sales personnel to support our sales efforts. A portion of current sales personnel are new to us, and new hires require significant training and may require a lengthy onboarding\nprocess before they achieve full productivity. Recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as expected. If we are unable to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of productive sales personnel, sales of our solutions and the growth of our business could be harmed. Additionally, if efforts to improve sales force productivity do not result in increased revenue, operating results could be negatively impacted due to increased operating expenses associated with these efforts.\nIn addition, our ability to generate growth partly depends on our ability to cross-sell solutions to existing customers and new customers. We have identified our ability to successfully cross-sell our solutions as a key part of our business strategy and therefore one of the most significant factors influencing growth. We may not be successful in cross-selling our solutions because customers may find additional solutions unnecessary, unattractive or cost-ineffective. Failure to sell additional solutions to existing and new customers could negatively affect our ability to grow our business.\nPoor service, system errors or failures of our solutions to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe must meet our customers\u2019 service level expectations and our contractual obligations with respect to our solutions. Failure to do so could subject us to liability or cause us to lose customers. In some cases, we rely upon third-party contractors (which, along with suppliers and other third-party vendors, are referred to as \u201cvendors\u201d) to assist us in providing our solutions. Our ability to meet our contractual obligations and customer expectations thus may be impacted by the performance of our vendors and their ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, our electronic payment and remittance solutions depend in part on the ability of our vendors to comply with applicable banking, financial service and payment card industry requirements and their failure to do so could cause an interruption in the solutions we provide or require us to seek alternative solutions or relationships. We likely will incur increased development costs to upgrade our software to be in compliance with changing and evolving standards, and delays may result in connection therewith. If our solutions are not in compliance with these evolving standards, our market position and sales could be adversely affected and we may have to invest significantly in changes and updates to our solutions, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nSome of our solutions are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. Although our contracts disclaim liability for medical decisions and responsibility for patient care, if use of or inability to use our solutions leads to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, such disclaimers may be unenforceable and we could be subject to claims or litigation, including product liability and warranty claims, by healthcare professionals, their patients or customers. Product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive damages. The magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time, and the related legal defense costs may be significant. We could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of our products or services are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may voluntarily participate, or be required by regulatory authorities to participate, in a recall of that product or service. In the event of a recall, we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or class-action litigation claims. Further, negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our reputation, decrease demand for our solutions, lead to withdrawals of our solutions or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our solutions in the future. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of the software and systems that we use to provide our solutions are inherently complex. Errors or downtime in the software and systems we use to provide our solutions could negatively impact our customers. For example, because of the large amount of data we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures and errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be\nincomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers could regard as significant. In addition, errors in our transaction processing systems could result in payers paying the wrong amount, payers making payments to the wrong payee or delayed payments. Although we seek to address any errors or downtime with updates to the software and systems, if we are unable to promptly remedy any errors or our customers do not implement system updates, the software and systems could be compromised or our customers could experience prolonged downtimes relating to the software and systems. If problems occur or persist, our customers may seek compensation from us, seek to terminate their contracts, withhold payments, seek refunds from us of part or all of the fees charged under our contracts, ask us to reconstruct lost or corrupted data at our expense, request a loan or advancement of funds or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures. We also may be subject to claims by others affected by any such problems. Further, some of our existing and prospective customers may be reluctant or unwilling to use cloud-based services, because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If our existing or prospective customers do not perceive the benefits of our services, then the market for these solutions may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nWe attempt to limit, by contract, our liability for damages arising from our negligence, errors, mistakes or security breaches. However, contractual limitations on liability may not be accepted by our customers, may not be enforceable or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages. We maintain liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions and cyber-liability. It is possible, however, that claims could be denied or exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage, if any, or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention away from our operations. In addition, negative publicity caused by these events may negatively impact our customer relationships, market acceptance of our solutions, including unrelated solutions, or may harm our reputation and business.\nDisruptions in service or damages to our data or other operation centers, or other software or systems failures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur data and network operations centers are essential to our business. our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our network and computer systems, many of which are located in our primary data and operations centers that we own and operate and some of which are outsourced to certain third-party hosting providers. We have consolidated several satellite data centers and plans to continue such consolidation. We also provide remote and cloud hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of vendors for our customers. The ability to access the systems, applications, and data that we host and support on demand is important to our customers.\nOur operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane, tornado and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyber and ransomware attacks, computer viruses, hacking, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other similar disruptive problems. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays or cessations in service to users of our solutions, which could impair or prohibit our ability to provide our solutions, reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to our customers and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If customers\u2019 access to our solutions is interrupted because of problems in our operations or our facilities, we could be in breach of our agreements with customers and/or exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care.\nWe attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery and business continuity plans, penetration testing, vulnerability scans, patching and other information security procedures and\ncybersecurity and ransomware measures, insurance against fires, floods, other natural disasters, cyber-liability and general business interruptions, and customer and employee training and awareness, but our precautions cannot protect against all risks. Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to provide our solutions or remote hosting services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe also rely on a number of vendors, such as cloud service providers, to provide us with a variety of solutions and services, including cloud-based data hosting, telecommunications and data processing services necessary for our transaction services and processing functions and software developers for the development and maintenance of certain software products we use to provide our solutions. As a result, our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may rely, in part, upon vendors of related services. If these vendors do not fulfill their contractual obligations, have system failures or choose to discontinue their products or services, our business and operations could be disrupted, our brand and reputation could be harmed and our financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties and our own systems in providing certain of our solutions to our customers, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with customers, adversely affecting our brand and our business.\nOur ability to deliver our solutions is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network connection with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telephone and facsimile services. As a result, our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, emerging cybersecurity risks and threats, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing preferences of our customers.\nOur solutions are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments. However, we have experienced limited interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slow down the performance of our solutions, and we may experience more significant interruptions in the future. We rely on internal systems as well as vendors, including bandwidth and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our solutions. We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other catastrophic events, could affect the security or availability of our solutions and prevent or inhibit the ability of our customers to access our solutions.\nIf a catastrophic event were to occur with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could result in substantial costs to remedy those problems or negatively impact our relationship with our partners, our business, results of operations and financial condition. To operate without interruption, both us and our vendors must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss, tornado and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntelecommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures and crashes;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems; and\n\u2022\nother potential interruptions.\nAny disruption in the network access, telecommunications or co-location services provided by vendors, or any failure of or by vendors\u2019 systems or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could\nsignificantly harm our business. We exercise limited control over these vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these vendor technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with partners and adversely affect our business and could expose us to liabilities. Although we maintain insurance for our business, the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost.\nThe reliability and performance of our internet connection may be harmed by increased usage or by denial-of-service attacks. The internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of our infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet-based solutions.\nAs a result of the complexity of the issues facing healthcare providers and payers and the inherent complexity of our solutions to such issues, our customers depend on our support organization to resolve any technical issues relating to our offerings. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the quality of our offerings, on our business reputation and on strong recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality and highly responsive technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality and highly responsive support, could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to sell our offering to existing and prospective customers, and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe offer technical support services with our offerings, and we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services, particularly as we increase the size of our customer base. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. It is difficult to predict customer demand for technical support services and, if customer demand increases significantly, we may be unable to provide satisfactory support services to our customers and their constituents. Additionally, increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe market price of shares of our Common Stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations and have become especially volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our Common Stock regardless of our operating performance. We expect a high level of volatility to continue as the effects of COVID-19 continue to impact the economy, healthcare industry and our business. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, if any, to stockholders, the impact of COVID-19 on our business, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in or individual scandals, and in response the market price of shares of our Common Stock could decrease significantly. Stock markets and the price of shares of our Common Stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to appropriately assess the risks in particular transactions.\nWe have historically acquired, and in the future may acquire, businesses, technologies, services, product lines and other assets. For example, on May 1, 2020, we closed on the acquisition of eRx Network and are currently in the process of integrating its business, assets and personnel. The successful integration of any businesses and assets we have acquired or may acquire can be critical to our future performance. The amount and timing of the expected benefits of any acquisition, including potential synergies, are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those relating to:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain relationships with the customers and suppliers of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nour ability to cross-sell solutions to customers with which we have established relationships and those with which the acquired businesses have established relationships;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain or replace key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential conflicts in payer, provider, vendor or marketing relationships;\n\u2022\nour ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and may have different business cultures;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of the operations of businesses or other assets we have acquired;\n\u2022\nthe continued coordination and cooperation with sellers pursuant to transition services agreements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration or migration of IT systems, including secure data sharing across networks securely and maintaining the security of the IT systems; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory, contracting and other requirements, including internal control over contracting and financial reporting.\nWe cannot guarantee that any acquired businesses, technologies, services, product lines or other assets will be successfully integrated with our operations in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. Failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to achieve anticipated operating synergies, revenue enhancements or cost savings could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough our management attempts to evaluate the risks inherent in each transaction and to evaluate acquisition candidates appropriately, we may not properly ascertain all such risks and the acquired businesses or other assets may not perform as we expect or enhance our value as a whole. Acquired companies or businesses also may have larger than expected liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification, if any, that we are able to obtain from the sellers. Furthermore, the historical financial statements of the companies we have acquired or may acquire in the future are prepared by management of such companies and are not independently verified by our management. In addition, any pro forma financial statements prepared by us to give effect to such acquisitions may not accurately reflect the results of operations of such companies that would have been achieved had the acquisition of such entities been completed at the beginning of the applicable periods. There are also no assurances that we will continue to acquire businesses at valuations consistent with our prior acquisitions or that we will complete acquisitions at all. If we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and growth strategies could be negatively affected.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of divestitures.\nFrom time to time we may divest assets or businesses. We may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to assets or a business that we want to dispose of, or we may dispose of assets or a business at a\nprice or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated. Additionally, such dispositions could result in disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or result in ongoing obligations and liabilities to us following any such divestiture. For example, in connection with a disposition, we may be contractually obligated with respect to certain continuing obligations to customers, vendors, or other third parties, and we may also have continuing indemnities and obligations for pre-existing liabilities related to the assets or businesses. Such obligations could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRecent and future developments in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAlmost all of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry, which is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. For example, the ACA changes how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. The ACA mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, expands health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector reforms, reduces Medicare program spending and promotes value-based purchasing. However, efforts by the current presidential administration and certain members of Congress to repeal or make significant changes to the ACA, our implementation and/or our interpretation have cast uncertainty onto the future of the law. For example, in December 2017, tax reform legislation was enacted that, effective January 2019, eliminates the financial penalty for individuals who fail to maintain health insurance coverage, a change that may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance. Further, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) has indicated that it intends to increase flexibility in state Medicaid programs, including by expanding the scope of waivers under which states may implement Medicaid expansion provisions, imposing different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implementing programs that vary from federal standards. At the same time, members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand the role of government-sponsored coverage, including single payer or so-called \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d proposals, which could have far-reaching implications for the healthcare industry if enacted. Furthermore, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional changes to the ACA may be proposed and calls for an expanded government healthcare coverage could accelerate.\nWe are unable to predict the full impact of the ACA and other health reform initiatives on our operations in light of the uncertainty regarding whether, when and how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative reforms (including single payer proposals), if any, may be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of alternative provisions and the impact of alternative provisions on various healthcare industry participants. In particular, because many of our solutions designed to assist customers in effectively navigating the shift to value-based healthcare, the elimination of, or significant revisions to, various value-based healthcare initiatives may adversely impact our business.\nWhile many of the provisions of the ACA and other health reform initiatives may not be directly applicable to us, such initiatives affect the businesses of our customers and the Medicaid programs of the states with which we have contracts. For example, as a result of Medicare payment reductions and other reimbursement changes mandated under the ACA, our customers may attempt to seek price concessions from us or reduce their use of our solutions, especially if provisions expanding coverage are repealed without eliminating the payment reductions or other reimbursement changes. Thus, the ACA may result in a reduction of expenditures by customers or potential customers in the healthcare industry, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, certain government programs, such as the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative and the Accountable Care Organization Shared Savings Program, may impact reimbursement to our customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the general uncertainty of healthcare reform efforts, particularly if Congress repeals provisions of the ACA but delays the implementation date of repeal or fails to enact replacement provisions at the time of repeal, may negatively impact purchase decisions or demand for our solutions.\nMoreover, there are currently numerous federal, state and private initiatives seeking to increase the use of IT in healthcare as a means of improving care and reducing costs. For example, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (\u201cHITECH\u201d) Act, which was enacted in 2009, and the 21st Century Cures Act (the \u201cCures Act\u201d), which was enacted in 2016, contain incentives and penalties to promote the use of Electronic Health Records (\u201cEHR\u201d) technology and the efficient exchange of health information electronically. Further, the Cures Act provides for penalties to be imposed on IT developers, health information exchanges or networks and health providers that are found to improperly block the exchange of health information. These and other initiatives may result in additional or costly legal or regulatory requirements that are applicable to us and our customers, may encourage more companies to enter our markets, may provide advantages to our competitors and may result in the development of technology solutions that compete with us. Any such initiatives also may result in a reduction of expenditures by existing or potential customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, other general reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry constituents could result from, among other things, government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which providers interact with patients, payers or other healthcare industry constituents, including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare solutions. In addition, cost containment efforts at the federal and state levels may affect industry expenditures. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit. CMS began imposing a 2% reduction on payments of Medicare claims in 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2029.\nEven if general expenditures by healthcare industry constituents remain the same or increase, other developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending on healthcare IT and services or in some or all of the specific markets we serve or are planning to serve. In addition, our customers\u2019 expectations regarding pending or potential healthcare industry developments also may affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to the types of solutions we provide. For example, use of our solutions could be affected by:\n\u2022\nchanges in the billing patterns of providers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the design of health insurance plans;\n\u2022\nchanges in the contracting methods payers use in their relationships with providers;\n\u2022\ndecreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical companies or medical device manufacturers, as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit promotional activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies or other factors; and\n\u2022\nimplementation of government programs that streamline and standardize eligibility enrollment processes, which could result in decreased pricing or demand for our eligibility and enrollment solutions.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. The timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot be sure that the markets for our solutions will continue to exist at their current levels, will not change in ways that adversely affect us or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nGovernment regulation, industry standards and other requirements create risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequently changing laws, regulations, industry standards and other requirements. Many healthcare laws and regulations are complex, and their application to specific solutions, services and relationships may not be clear. Because our customers are subject to various requirements, we may be impacted as a result of our contractual obligations even when we are not directly\nsubject to such requirements. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare IT solutions and services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our solutions in ways that we do not anticipate. The ACA, efforts to repeal or materially change the ACA, and other federal and state efforts to reform or revise aspects of the healthcare industry or to revise or create additional legal or regulatory requirements could impact our operations, the use of our solutions and our ability to market new solutions, or could create unexpected liabilities for us.\nWe also may be impacted by non-healthcare laws, industry standards and other requirements. For example, laws, regulations and industry standards regulating the banking and financial services industry may impact our operations as a result of the payment and remittance services we offer directly or through vendors. Additionally, laws and regulations governing how we communicate with our customers and our customers\u2019 patients may impact our operations and, if not followed, would result in fines, penalties and other liabilities and adverse publicity and injury to our reputation.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to laws, regulations and other requirements, including related contractual obligations, might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance.\nWe have attempted to structure our operations to comply with laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to us directly and to our customers and contractors, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives. We have been, and in the future may become, involved in governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Certain of our businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for compliance with various legal, regulatory or other requirements. Any determination by a court or agency that our solutions violate, or cause our customers to violate, applicable laws, regulations or other requirements could subject us or our customers to civil or criminal penalties. Such a determination also could require us to modify or terminate portions of our business, disqualify us from serving customers that do business with government entities or cause us to refund some or all of our service fees or otherwise compensate our customers. In addition, failure to satisfy laws, regulations or other requirements could adversely affect demand for our solutions and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to address the failure. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory and other authorities or private whistleblowers could be expensive and time-consuming, could result in loss of business, exposure to adverse publicity and injury to our reputation and could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers. Laws, regulations and other requirements impacting our operations include the following:\nHIPAA. If we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to it, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers and be subject to investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) Office for Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d). In the event OCR finds that we have failed to comply with applicable HIPAA privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. In addition, OCR performs compliance audits of Covered Entities and Business Associates in order to proactively enforce the HIPAA privacy and security standards. OCR has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend. OCR has the discretion to impose penalties without being required to attempt to resolve violations through informal means; further OCR may require companies to enter into resolution agreements and corrective action plans which impose ongoing compliance requirements. OCR enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions under either HIPAA or relevant state laws seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. Although we have implemented and maintained policies, processes and a compliance program infrastructure (e.g., a Privacy Office) to assist us in complying with these laws and regulations and our contractual obligations, we cannot provide assurance regarding how these laws and regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. In addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities,\nour ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state levels also might require us to make costly system purchases and/or modifications or otherwise divert significant resources to HIPAA compliance initiatives from time to time.\nHIPAA and our implementing regulations mandate format and data content standards and provider identifier standards (known as the National Provider Identifier) that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. HHS has established standards that health plans must use for electronic fund transfers with providers, has established operating rules for certain transactions, and is in the process of establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of the remaining types of covered transactions. The ACA also requires HHS to establish standards for health claims attachment transactions. HHS has modified the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from Version 4010/4010A to Version 5010. Further, as of 2015, HHS requires the use of updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as the ICD-10 code sets. Enforcement of compliance with these standards falls under HHS and is carried out by CMS.\nIn the event new requirements are imposed, we will be required to modify our systems and processes to accommodate these changes. We will seek to modify our systems and processes as needed to prepare for and implement changes to the transaction standards, code sets operating rules and identifier requirements; however, we may not be successful in responding to these changes, and any responsive changes we make to our systems and processes may result in errors or otherwise negatively impact our service levels. In addition, the compliance dates for new or modified transaction standards, operating rules and identifiers may overlap, which may further burden our resources.\nWe also may experience complications related to supporting customers that are not fully compliant with the revised requirements as of the applicable compliance or enforcement date. Some payers and healthcare clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do or may require us to use legacy formats or include legacy identifiers as they transition to full compliance with the revised requirements. For example, we continue to process transactions using legacy identifiers for non-Medicare claims that are sent to us to the extent that the intended recipients have not instructed us to suppress those legacy identifiers. Where payers or healthcare clearinghouses require conformity with their interpretations or require us to accommodate legacy transactions or identifiers as a condition of successful transactions, we seek to comply with their requirements. We continue to work with payers, providers, practice management system vendors and other healthcare industry constituents to implement the transaction standards and identifier standards. However, we cannot provide assurances regarding how CMS will enforce the transaction and identifier standards or how CMS will view our practice of accommodating requests to process transactions that include legacy formats or identifiers for non-Medicare claims. It is possible that us, or our customers, could be subject to enforcement actions as a result of these accommodations. Any regulatory change, clarification or enforcement action by CMS that prohibited the processing by healthcare clearinghouses or private payers of transactions containing legacy formats or identifiers could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOther Privacy and Security Requirements. There also are numerous U.S. federal, state and international privacy and security laws that govern the collection, dissemination, use, access, retention, protection, transfer and confidentiality of personal information. For example, GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, is more stringent than laws and regulations governing personal information in the U.S. Certain of our solutions involve the transmission and storage of customer data in various jurisdictions, which subjects the operation of that service to privacy or data protection laws and regulations in those jurisdictions. While we believe these solutions comply with current regulatory and security requirements in the jurisdictions in which we provide these solutions, there can be no assurance that such requirements will not change or that we will not otherwise be subject to legal or regulatory actions. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing, and could have an adverse impact on our operations. These laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted and enforced by government authorities and regulators. The costs of compliance with, and the\nother burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, prevent us from providing our solutions, and/or impact our ability to invest in or jointly develop our solutions. We also may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these laws and regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could result in fines, penalties, other liability, or could result in adverse publicity or a loss of reputation, and adversely affect our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us or by our solutions to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to legal or regulatory actions, damage our reputation or adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions in the jurisdiction that has enacted the applicable law or regulation. Moreover, if these laws and regulations change, or are interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and processes or the operation of our solutions, we may need to expend resources in order to change our business operations, policies and processes or the manner in which we provide our solutions. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnti-Kickback and Anti-Referral Laws. A number of federal and state laws govern patient referrals, financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and inducements to providers and patients, including restrictions contained in amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the \u201cfederal Anti-Kickback Statute (\u201cAKS\u201d).\u201d The AKS contains a limited number of exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) of HHS has created regulatory safe harbors to the AKS. Activities that comply with a safe harbor are deemed protected from prosecution under the AKS. Our contracts and other arrangements may not meet an exception or a safe harbor. Additionally, many states have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program. In addition, federal laws restricting certain physician self-referrals (also known as the \u201cStark Law\u201d), as well as state counterparts, may prohibit payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with physicians or other healthcare providers. To the extent we undertake billing and coding for designated health services, such activities may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper.\nThe laws and regulations in this area are both broad and vague and judicial interpretation can also be inconsistent. We review our practices with regulatory experts in an effort to comply with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. However, we are unable to predict how these laws and regulations will be interpreted or the full extent of their application, particularly to services that are not directly reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as transaction processing services. Any determination by a federal or state regulatory authority that any of our activities or those of our customers or vendors violate any of these laws or regulations could: (i) subject us to civil or criminal penalties, (ii) require us to enter into corporate integrity agreements or similar agreements with government regulators to meet ongoing compliance obligations, (iii) require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, (iv) require us to refund a portion of our service fees, (v) disqualify us from providing services to customers that are, or do business with, government programs and/or (vi) have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Even an unsuccessful challenge by a regulatory authority of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.\nFalse or Fraudulent Claim Laws; Medical Billing and Coding. Medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance. We may be subject to, or contractually required to comply with, numerous federal and state laws that prohibit false or fraudulent claims including but not limited to the FCA, the CMP, and state equivalents. For example, errors or the unintended consequences of data manipulations by us or our systems with respect to the entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claims, coding, audit, eligibility and other information, may result in allegations of false or fraudulent claims. False or fraudulent claims under the FCA and other laws include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, making or causing to be made or used a false record or statement that is material to a false claim, failing to refund known overpayments, misrepresenting actual services rendered, improper coding and billing for medically unnecessary items or services. Some of these laws, including CMP, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud, waste and abuse laws. Federal and state\nauthorities increasingly assert liability under CMP, especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the various criminal healthcare fraud provisions. Current penalties under CMP are significant, up to $100,000 per prohibited kickback and assessments of up to three times the amount claimed or received. Further, violations of the FCA are punishable by treble damages and penalties of up to $22,363 per false claim, and whistleblowers may receive a share of amounts recovered. Civil monetary penalties, including those imposed under the AKS and the FCA, are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.\nIn addition, the FCA prohibits the knowing submission of false claims or statements to the federal government, including to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The FCA also contains qui tam, or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to sue on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. Although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, \u201cknowingly\u201d is defined broadly by the FCA and submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity can constitute \u201cknowingly\u201d submitting a false claim and may result in liability. Several states, including states in which we operate, have adopted their own false claims provisions and their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private individual may file a civil lawsuit in state court. Civil penalties also may be imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment made by the federal government within 60 days of identifying the overpayment and also may result in liability under the FCA. The FCA provides that submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. Whistleblowers and federal authorities have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly violated other statutes, such as Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. Although we believe our processes are consistent with applicable reimbursement rules and industry practice, a court, government authority or whistleblower could challenge these processes. In addition, we cannot guarantee that federal and state authorities will regard any billing and coding errors we process or make as inadvertent or will not hold us responsible for any compliance issues related to claims, reports and other information we handle on behalf of providers and payers. We cannot predict the impact of any enforcement actions under the various false claims and fraud, waste and abuse laws applicable to our operations. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our practices could cause us to incur adverse publicity and significant legal and related costs.\nExclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. We are also subject to the exclusion rules of the OIG of HHS whereby OIG may or must exclude individuals and entities convicted of program-related crimes from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While we regularly screen for excluded individuals as part of our initial hiring and continued employment as well as excluded individuals and entities as part of our contractor practices, but we may not always identify all excluded individuals and entities.\nFDA and International Regulation of Medical Software. Certain of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. If the FDA chooses to regulate more of our solutions as medical devices, or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing certain regulatory controls, we may be obligated to comply with extensive requirements. Any additional FDA regulations governing healthcare software products may increase the cost and time-to-market of new or existing solutions or may prevent us from marketing our solutions. If we fail to maintain regulatory approvals and clearances, or are unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements, our ability to commercially distribute and market these products could suffer. Modifications to our medical device products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) or de novo clearances or premarket approvals, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. Once a device is on the market, we must comply with numerous additional regulations which may require us to file adverse event reports and recalls as well as manufacture the software in accordance with a quality management system. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In addition, we must comply with requirements and restrictions related to advertising, marketing and promotion\nof FDA-approved medical devices, as well as more stringent requirements applicable to medical devices that are pending FDA approval. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.S. or experience delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals or clearances, this could delay production of our medical device products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, where we sell our medical device solutions internationally, we are subject to international regulation regarding these medical device solutions. These international regulations could cause us to incur increased costs as they impose increased compliance obligations.\nInteroperability Requirements. There is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare IT products provided by various vendors be compatible with each other and allow for the efficient exchange of EHR information. Although several of our healthcare IT solutions have received certification, rules regarding interoperability and certification standards are subject to regular revision and updates. In March 2020, the ONC and CMS released final regulations concerning interoperability and information blocking. The final ONC rule address, among other things, the kinds of industry behaviors that do and do not constitute information blocking under the Cures Act and includes new criteria involving exporting electronic health information and standardized APIs for patient services. Health IT developers, exchanges, or networks that do engage in such information blocking by knowingly adopting practices that are likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage the access, exchange, or use of electronic health information, may be subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $1 million per violation. The final CMS rule, among other things, effectively mandates interoperability as a condition for participating in Medicare. While we believe we are well positioned to address these new rules, it is too early to tell the impact these rules will have on our business and the industry we serve. In October 2016, HHS published rules establishing processes to facilitate ONC\u2019s direct review and evaluation of the performance of certified health IT in certain circumstances, including in response to problems or issues that could pose serious risks to public health or safety. As a result of changing requirements, we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our solutions, and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle. We also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. To the extent these requirements subsequently are changed or supplemented, or our prior certifications are no longer valid, or we are delayed in receiving new certifications for our solutions, customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these solutions.\nRestrictions on Communications. Communications with our customers and our customers\u2019 patients increasingly are scrutinized under laws and regulations governing communications. For example, the TCPA subjects us and our vendors to various rules regarding contacting our customers and our customers\u2019 patients via telephone, fax or text message and may impact our operations. In the last few years, there has been a significant increase in class action lawsuits brought under the TCPA. This increase has been driven, in part, by more expansive interpretations of the activity subject to regulation under the TCPA by some courts and by the FCC, as well as by the significant statutory damages that are potentially available to successful plaintiffs. Because our solutions need and rely upon various messaging components to achieve successful outcomes for us and our customers, our ability to communicate with our customers and their patients may be affected by the TCPA, its implementing regulations and litigation pursuant to the TCPA. In addition, because of the scope and interpretation of the TCPA is continuing to evolve and develop, we inadvertently could fail to comply or be alleged to have failed to comply with the TCPA, and consequently be subject to significant statutory damages and negative publicity associated with class action litigation and/or costs associated with modifying our solutions and business strategies. Furthering the compliance challenges posed by the TCPA is the fact that the FCC continues to review dozens of petitions from parties in various industries that seek interpretation of the TCPA\u2019s various regulations. To the extent the FCC issues an order that alters current understanding and accepted interpretation of the TCPA\u2019s regulations, we may be required to modify our solutions in ways that may make\nthem less attractive to our customers and/or require us to alter our business strategies and incur increased costs. In addition, we also may be subject to claims alleging failure to comply with email and marketing regulations under the CAN-SPAM Act, and additional fax regulations under the Junk Fax Act and data privacy rules under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as well as potentially under non-U.S. laws that regulate communications and messaging and that affect our operations, such as CASL, GDPR, and the European Union\u2019s e-Privacy Directive and implementing member state laws (and any subsequent changes to such laws). As laws and regulations, including FTC enforcement, rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nFinancial Services Related Laws, Regulations and Industry Standards. Financial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards. These laws may subject us, our vendors and our customers to liability as a result of our communication and payment solutions. If we fail to comply with any applicable communication and payment rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and changes in transaction fees and may lose our ability to process payment transactions or facilitate other types of billing and payment solutions. Moreover, in addition to regulatory requirements related to electronic funds transfers, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing House Network are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association, and these rules may affect our payment practices. Certain payment transactions may be subject to card association and network rules and standards. Failure to comply with such rules or standards could subject us to fines or penalties imposed by such card associations and networks. If any changes in such rules or standards increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide our solutions, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer. Further, our communication and payment solutions may impact the ability of our payer customers to comply with state prompt payment laws. These laws require payers to pay healthcare claims meeting the statutory or regulatory definition of a \u201cclean claim\u201d within a specified time frame. Finally, as we expand our financial services offerings we may be subject to additional laws and regulations, including certain consumer protection laws such as the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (the \u201cFDCPA\u201d), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the \u201cFCRA\u201d) and various other state laws implicated by such financial services.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act and Bribery Laws. With our international businesses, we could incur significant fines and penalties, as well as criminal liability, if we fail to comply with either the anti-bribery or accounting requirements of the FCPA, or similar international bribery laws. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our compliance with these laws could cause us to incur adverse publicity and significant legal and related costs.\nPhysician Payments Sunshine Act. As a medical device manufacturer, we must report to CMS payments or \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to physicians, including meals, travel reimbursement, consulting fees and research payments. The Sunshine Act authorizes significant civil monetary penalties for each payment or transfer of value not accurately or completely reported. Although we have processes in place to track and timely report such financial relationships, we inadvertently may fail to track and report all such financial relationships and thus may be subject to penalties for such non-compliance.\nU.S. Postal Service Laws and Regulations. Our communication and payment solutions provide mailing services primarily delivered by the U.S. Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d or the \u201cPostal Service\u201d). Postage is the most significant cost incurred in the delivery of our communication and payment solutions. Although we generally pass increases in postage costs through to our customers, in some circumstances we may be unable to do so, or the resulting increases in our charges could cause our customers to reduce the volume of our services they purchase. While we cannot predict the magnitude of these effects, they could have a material effect on our business, operating results or financial condition if large enough.\nFirst, the Postal Service could increase the rates of postage that we must pay. Most of the mail that we send uses market-dominant mail products, whose postal rates are subject to maximum rate regulation. Current\nregulatory rules generally limit the average rate increase for each class of market-dominant mail to the rate of increase of the Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d). The Postal Service, however, has argued for eliminating or loosening this restriction, and the Postal Regulatory Commission is now considering proposed rule changes that would have this effect. It is also possible that Congress could eliminate or loosen the restriction on postal rate increases through legislation, particularly if the Postal Service continues to report financial losses.\nSecond, even under current regulatory standards, the Postal Service has broad flexibility to raise rates on individual rate categories within a class of mail faster than the CPI, as long as the average rates for the affected mail class as a whole do not increase than the CPI-based rate cap.\nThird, most of the postal rates that we pay reflect significant discounts from the basic USPS postage rate structure. These discounts could be changed or discontinued at any time on short notice. The Postal Service also could require more costly or difficult mail preparation (e.g., presorting, barcoding, bundling or destination entry) requirements as a condition for continuing to use the discounted rates. More onerous preparation requirements could force us to incur substantial additional mail preparation costs or pay higher rates of postage.\nFourth, it is possible that the Postal Service, the Postal Inspection Service, or other law enforcement officials could allege that we did not prepare past mailings as required to qualify for the discounted rates at which the mailings were mailed, and that we now owe additional postage. Further, if the government concludes that the noncompliance was intentional or reckless, the government could seek to recover treble damages and civil penalties of up to $22,363 per false claim (adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index). If the volume of mail subject to these allegations is large enough, the recovery sought could have a material effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nPayment Card Industry Standards. We accept credit card, eCheck, ACH Payments, and payments via online portal, phone/Interactive Voice Response system or by mail. Compliance with contractual obligations and evolving privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent ACH, credit card and debit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher ACH, credit card and debit card related costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The termination of our ability to process payments through ACH transactions or on any major credit or debit card would adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nOther State Healthcare Laws. Most states have a variety of laws that potentially impact our operations and business practices. If our arrangements with physicians or other practitioners were found to violate a corporate practice of medicine, nursing and other licensed professions prohibition or fee-splitting prohibition, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties, be required to terminate or make changes to our contractual arrangements with practitioners in such states or to our business generally, or be required to remit portions of our services fees to practitioners, which, in turn, may adversely affect both our operations and profitability. Further, we could face sanctions for aiding and abetting the violation of the state\u2019s professional licensure statutes. In addition, we hold certain state licenses and enrollments in government healthcare programs which subject us to additional requirements and scrutiny by government regulators. Failure to comply with requirements and obligations imposed by such licensure and enrollments may result in civil and criminal penalties and may otherwise adversely affect our business. We continually monitors legislative, regulatory and judicial developments related to licensure and engagement arrangements with professionals; however, new agency interpretations, federal or state legislation or regulations, or judicial decisions could require us to change how we operate, may increase our costs of services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur infrastructure, data or other operation centers and systems used in our business operations, including the internet and related systems of our vendors are vulnerable to, and from time to time experience, unauthorized access to data and/or breaches of confidential information.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper dissemination of personal information of individuals both within and outside of the healthcare industry. Most states require holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals or the state\u2019s attorney general. In some states, these laws are limited to electronic data, but states increasingly are enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. Additionally, HIPAA imposes certain notification requirements on both Covered Entities and Business Associates. In certain circumstances involving large breaches, requirements may even involve notification to the media. A non-permitted use or disclosure of protected health information is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the Covered Entity or Business Associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with requirements enumerated in HIPAA.\nFurther, the FTC has prosecuted certain data breach cases as unfair and deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition, by regulation, the FTC requires creditors, which may include some of our customers, to implement identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with customer accounts. Although Congress passed legislation that restricts the definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d and exempts many healthcare providers from complying with this identity theft prevention rule, we may be required to apply additional resources to our existing processes to assist our affected customers in complying with this rule.\nDespite our security management efforts with respect to physical and technological infrastructure, employee training, vendor (and sub-vendor) controls and contractual relationships, our infrastructure, data or other operation centers and systems used in our business operations, including the internet and related systems of our vendors (including vendors to whom we outsource data hosting, storage and processing functions) are vulnerable to, and from time to time experience, unauthorized access to data and/or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct, physical break-ins, hackers, employee or insider malfeasance and/or improper employee or contractor access, computer viruses, programming errors, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware events, phishing schemes, fraud, terrorist attacks, human error or other breaches by insiders or third parties or similar disruptive problems. It is not possible to prevent all security threats to our systems and data. See \u201c-Breaches and failures of our IT systems and the security measures protecting them, and the sensitive information we transmit, use and store, expose us to potential liability and reputational harm.\u201d\nLegislative changes and contractual limitations may impede our ability to utilize our offshore service capabilities.\nIn our operations, we have contractors and employees located outside of the U.S. who may have access to personal information, including protected health information in order to assist us in performing services for our customers. From time to time, Congress considers legislation that would restrict the transmission of personal information regarding a U.S. resident to any foreign affiliate, subcontractor or unaffiliated third party without adequate privacy protections or without providing notice to the identifiable individual of the transmission and an opportunity to opt out. Some of the proposals considered would have required patient consent and imposed liability on healthcare businesses arising from the improper sharing or other misuse of personal information. Congress also has considered creating a private civil cause of action that would allow an injured party to recover damages sustained as a result of a violation of these proposed restrictions. Furthermore, a number of states have considered prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of personal information to individuals or entities located outside of the U.S. If legislation of this type is enacted, our ability to utilize offshore resources may be impeded, and we may be subject to sanctions for failure to comply with the new mandates of the legislation. In addition, the enactment of such legislation could result in such work being performed at a lower margin of profitability, or even at a loss. In addition, CMS requires that some of our customers, including Medicare Advantage\norganizations and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and their subcontractors, submit certain information regarding their offshore subcontractors and attest that measures have been taken to mitigate risk associated with sharing personal information with such offshore subcontractors. As a result, we may be required to submit information or an attestation and may be impacted by our customer\u2019s failure to submit accurate and complete information or attestations. Further, as a result of concerns regarding the possible misuse of personal information, some of our customers have contractually limited or may seek to limit our ability to use our offshore resources which may increase our costs. Use of offshore resources may increase our risk of violating our contractual obligations to our customers to protect the privacy and security of personal information provided to us, which could adversely impact our reputation and our business. In addition, depending on the location of contractors and employees accessing personal information outside of the U.S., we may have additional compliance obligations under non-U.S. laws applicable to accessing, using, or otherwise processing personal information and transmitting that information back to the U.S.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our international operations.\nWe market, sell and support our solutions internationally. We plan to continue to expand our non-U.S. operations and continue to focus on developing successful direct and indirect non-U.S. sales and support channels. Non-U.S. operations are subject to inherent risks, and our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing non-U.S. operations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of global economic and political market conditions;\n\u2022\neffects of sovereign debt conditions, including budgetary constraints;\n\u2022\nunfavorable or volatile foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nlegal compliance costs or business risks associated with our global operations where: (i) local laws and customs differ from, or are more stringent than those in the U.S., such as those relating to data privacy and data security, or (ii) risk is heightened with the FCPA, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncertification, licensing, or regulatory requirements, including obligations imposed on manufacturers and distributors of medical devices by non-U.S. regulatory agencies, and unexpected changes to those requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges to or reduced protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in protecting, maintaining and obtaining registered intellectual property, such as patents and trademarks;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences as a result of changes in tax laws or otherwise, and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner;\n\u2022\ndifferent or additional functionality requirements or preferences;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures;\n\u2022\neconomic sanctions;\n\u2022\nexport control regulations;\n\u2022\ndisruption of, or loss of access to, regional information technology or telecommunication networks;\n\u2022\nhealth service provider or government spending patterns or government-imposed austerity measures;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, war or terrorist acts; and\n\u2022\nlabor disruptions that may occur in a country.\nWe rely on vendors and other third parties including vendors outside the U.S., for some of our IT infrastructure, development and maintenance, quality assurance, operations, and customer support.\nWe currently depend on various vendors and other third parties for substantial business functions, including with respect to our IT systems (including infrastructure, application development, purchase and distribution, payment processing, manufacturing, and maintenance), business process outsourcing, call center services, customer support and similar services. Specifically, we outsource some of our software development and design, quality assurance, and operations activities to third-party vendors that have employees and consultants located outside the U.S. In February 2018, the Joint Venture entered into a ten-year contract with Wipro in which it initially committed to purchase from Wipro at least $1.0 billion in outsourced professional services over the ten-year term of the contract, and in March 2020, that commitment amount was adjusted to $975.0 million. If the Joint Venture fails to meet this minimum commitment, it may be forced to pay to Wipro 25% of the shortfall relative to the minimum commitment at the end of the term, thus increasing our costs without a commensurate increase in services provided to our business. If we had terminated the Wipro contract on March 31, 2020, we estimate that the termination fee would have been approximately $220.8 million, which represents the greater of (i) a termination fee equal to 25% of the remaining unspent minimum commitment and (ii) the remaining unrecovered costs incurred by Wipro in connection with its performance under the agreement. In addition, the Joint Venture\u2019s dependence on Wipro and our dependence on other third-party vendors creates a number of business risks-in particular, the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management with respect to these outsourcing arrangements of our business operations and that we cannot control the information systems, facilities or networks of such vendors.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if the information systems, facilities or networks of a third party vendor are disrupted (including disruption of access), are damaged or fail, whether due to physical disruptions, such as fire, natural disaster, pandemic or power outage, or due to cyber-security incidents, ransomware or other actions of vendors, including labor strikes, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Moreover, because certain of our third-party vendors conduct operations for us outside the U.S., the political and military events in foreign jurisdictions could have an adverse impact on our outsourced operations. If we experiences problems with our third-party vendors, if the costs charged by our third-party vendors increase or if our agreements with our third-party vendors are terminated, we may not be able to develop new solutions, enhance or operate existing solutions, or provide customer support in an alternate manner that is equally or more efficient and cost-effective.\nFailure by our customers to obtain proper permissions or provide us with accurate and appropriate information may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of information, which could harm our business. Additionally, privacy concerns relating to our business could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from using our solutions.\nTo the extent we are not otherwise permitted to use and/or disclose customer information, we require our customers to provide necessary notices and obtain necessary permissions for the use and disclosure of the information that we receive from our member engagement, member eligibility, billing and coding and other solutions. If they do not provide necessary notices or obtain necessary permissions, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by federal or state privacy or other laws. Such failures by our customers could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain or are based upon such information. For example, as part of our claims submission services, we rely on our customers to provide us with accurate and appropriate information and directives for our actions. While we have implemented features and safeguards relating to the accuracy and completeness of claims content, these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers. In addition, such failures by our customers could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules, analyses or other data-driven activities that benefit us or make our solutions less useful. Accordingly, we may be subject to claims or liability for inaccurate claims data submitted to payers or for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice or permission. As another example, we rely on our customers to provide us with accurate and appropriate billing and coding information, including provider enrollment information and medical\nnecessity information. While we have implemented features and safeguards relating to provider enrollment and medical necessity requirements, these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate or incomplete billing and coding claims from being submitted to payers. Accordingly, we may be subject to claims or liability for inaccurate or incomplete billing and coding claims. These claims or liabilities could damage our reputation, subject us to unexpected costs and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, in recent years, consumer advocates, media and elected officials increasingly and publicly have criticized companies in data focused industries regarding the collection, storage and use of personal data, including the licensing of de-identified data, by such companies. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information, the licensing of de-identified data, or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCertain of our solutions present the potential for embezzlement, identity theft or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or vendors and a failure of our employees or vendors to observe quality standards or adhere to environmental, social and governance standards could damage our reputation.\nAmong other things, our solutions include printing and mailing checks and/or facilitating electronic funds transfers for our payer customers and handling mail and payments from payers and from patients for many of our provider customers. These services frequently include handling original checks, payment card information, banking account information and may include currency. Even in those cases in which we do not facilitate payments or handle original documents or mail, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds. If any of our employees or vendors or other bad actors takes, converts or misuses such funds, documents or information, or we experience a data breach creating a risk of identity theft, we could be liable for damages, and our reputation could be damaged or destroyed. In addition, we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data and, therefore, be subject to civil or criminal liability. Federal and state regulators may take the position that a data breach or misdirection of data constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or trade practice. We also may be required to notify individuals affected by any data breaches. Further, a data breach or similar incident could impact the ability of our customers that are creditors to comply with the federal \u201cred flags\u201d rules, which require the implementation of identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with customer accounts.\nMany of our licensees, as well as vendors are subject to specified product quality standards and other requirements pursuant to the related licensing or supply agreements. The non-compliance by these entities with the terms and conditions of their respective contracts that pertain to health and safety standards, quality control, product consistency, compliance with law, or proper marketing or other business practices, may adversely impact the goodwill of our business. We may not be able to adequately prevent such practices, which could harm the value of our business, result in the abandonment, dilution or invalidity of trademarks associated with our business and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, such licensees and suppliers could violate environmental, social and governance standards or engage in unethical conduct. Further, despite our policies to the contrary, we may not be able to control the conduct of every individual actor, and our employees and personnel may violate environmental, social or governance standards or engage in other unethical conduct. These acts could adversely impact the reputation of our business.\nContractual relationships with customers that are governmental agencies or are funded by government programs may impose special burdens on us and provide special benefits to those customers.\nA portion of our revenue comes from customers that are governmental agencies or are funded by government programs. our contracts and subcontracts may be subject to some or all of the following:\n\u2022\ntermination when appropriated funding for the current fiscal year is exhausted;\n\u2022\ntermination for the governmental customer\u2019s convenience, subject to a negotiated settlement for costs incurred and profit on work completed, along with the right to place contracts out for bid before completion of the full contract term, as well as the right to make unilateral changes in contract requirements, subject to negotiated price adjustments;\n\u2022\ncompliance and reporting requirements related to, among other things, agency-specific policies and regulations, information security, subcontracting requirements, equal employment opportunity, affirmative action for veterans and workers with disabilities and accessibility for the disabled;\n\u2022\nbroad audit rights;\n\u2022\nownership of inventions made with federal funding under the Bayh-Dole Act; and\n\u2022\nspecialized remedies for breach and default, including setoff rights, risk allocation, retroactive price adjustments and civil or criminal fraud penalties, re-procurement expenses, as well as mandatory administrative dispute resolution procedures instead of state contract law remedies.\nIn addition, certain violations of federal and state law may result in termination of our contracts and subcontracts, and under certain circumstances, suspension and/or debarment from future government contracts. We are also subject to conflict-of-interest rules that may affect our eligibility for some federal, state and local government contracts and subcontracts, including rules applicable to all U.S. government contracts and subcontracts, as well as rules applicable to the specific agencies with which we have contracts or with which we may seek to enter into contracts.\nThe protection of our intellectual property requires substantial resources and protections of our proprietary rights may not be adequate.\nWe rely upon a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, patents, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures designed to protect the intellectual property used in our business. The steps we have taken to protect and enforce our proprietary rights and intellectual property may not be adequate. For instance, we may not be able to secure trademark or service mark registrations for marks in the U.S. or in foreign countries or take similar steps to secure patents for our proprietary processes, methods and technologies. Even if we are successful in obtaining patent and/or trademark registrations, these registrations may be opposed or invalidated by a third party. In addition, our agreements with employees, consultants and others who develop intellectual property for or on behalf of us could be breached and could result in our trade secrets and confidential information being publicly disclosed. We may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Third parties also may infringe upon or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents and other intellectual property rights. If we believe a third party has misappropriated our intellectual property, litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect those rights, which would divert management resources, would be expensive and may not effectively protect our intellectual property. Even if we establish infringement, a court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our Common Stock. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings. As a result, if we fail to maintain adequate intellectual property protection or if a third party infringes or misappropriates our intellectual property, it may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, or be approved on a timely basis, if at all. Similarly,\nany term extensions that we seek may not be approved on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, our issued patents, or any patents that may issue in the future, may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. The validity and scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have their own patent laws. The validity, enforceability, scope and effective term of patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that vary based on the local law of the relevant jurisdiction. Our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country\u2019s practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights. Patent protection must be obtained on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and we only pursue patent protection in countries where we think it makes commercial sense for the given product. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements terminate, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPatent law reform in the U.S. and other countries may also weaken our ability to enforce our patent rights, or make such enforcement financially unattractive. For instance, in September 2011, the U.S. enacted the America Invents Act, which permits enhanced third-party actions for challenging patents and implements a first-to-invent system. These reforms could result in increased costs to protect our intellectual property or limit our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products in these jurisdictions. Additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur trademarks, logos, and brands may provide us with a competitive advantage in the market as they may be known or trusted by consumers. In order to maintain the value of such brands, we must be able to enforce and defend our trademarks. We have pursued and will pursue the registration of trademarks, logos and service marks in the U.S. and internationally; however, enforcing rights against those who knowingly or unknowingly dilute or infringe our brands can be difficult. Effective trademark, service mark, trade dress or related protections may not be available in every country in which our solutions are available. Enforcement is especially difficult in first-to-file countries where \u2018\u2018trademark squatters\u2019\u2019 can prevent us from obtaining adequate protections for our brands. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken and will take to protect our proprietary rights in our brands and trademarks will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe, dilute or misappropriate our brands, trademarks, trade dress or other similar proprietary rights.\nMany of our products are based on or incorporate proprietary information. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by generally requiring our employees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment, engagement or other relationship. Despite these efforts and precautions, we may be unable to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by such unauthorized use.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop products or services that are equivalent or superior to our solutions.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThird parties may attempt to commercialize competitive products or services in foreign countries where we do not have any patents or patent applications and where legal recourse may be limited. This may have a significant commercial impact on our foreign business operations.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our solutions in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. may be less extensive than those in the U.S. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, Europe has a heightened requirement for patentability of software inventions. Thus, even in countries where we do pursue patent protection, there can be no assurance that any patents will issue with claims that cover our solutions. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the U.S. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and services and further, may export otherwise infringing products and services to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement on infringing activities is inadequate. These products or services may compete with our products or services, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries, including India and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to our patents to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. Finally, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws.\nThird parties may claim that we or our distributors or licensors are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling certain solutions.\nWe or our distributors and licensors could be subject to claims that we are misappropriating or infringing intellectual property (including patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names) or other proprietary rights of others. We may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend and divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and even if we believe it does not infringe a validly existing third-party right we may choose to license such rights. If we or our distributors or licensors become liable to third parties for infringing these rights, we could be required to pay a substantial damage award, including treble damages in some cases, and to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or stop activities or services that use or contain the infringing intellectual property, which could include a recall or cessation of sales in the future. We may also decide to settle such matters on terms that are unfavorable to us. We may be unable to develop non-infringing solutions or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We also may be required to indemnify our customers if they become subject to third party claims relating to intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to them, which could be costly.\nThe intellectual property positions of pharmaceutical and health IT services frequently involve complex legal and factual questions. For example, while we generally enter into proprietary information agreements with our employees and third parties which assign intellectual property rights to us, these agreements may not be honored or may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us under the local laws of some countries or jurisdictions. We cannot be certain that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that may prevent us from manufacturing, developing or marketing certain of our products, regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable or we believe we would otherwise be able to develop a more commercially successful product, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we may employ individuals who were previously employed at other healthcare companies. We may be subject to claims that us or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Further, we may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our solutions. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging our right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. In addition to paying monetary damages, if we fail in defending against any such claims we may lose our rights therein, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nOur solutions depend, in part, on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.\nMuch of our business and many of our solutions rely on key technologies or content developed or licensed by third parties. For example, many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including both proprietary and open source licenses. These third-party software components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our solutions, or our relationship with the third party licensor may deteriorate, or our contracts with the third party licensor may expire or be terminated. In addition, like most other service providers in the healthcare industry, many of our products rely on proprietary healthcare codes, descriptive terms and other content, such as Current Procedural Terminology codes (\u201cCPT\u201d codes), that third parties, such as the American Medical Association (\u201cAMA\u201d) develop and license for the purpose of maintaining standard language and coding throughout the healthcare industry. Because CPT codes are licensed by the AMA on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, we anticipate the continued availability of such content; however, if we are unable to maintain an ongoing license for such content, certain of our products may become partially or entirely incompatible with the healthcare industry. We may also face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors either will refuse to license to us at all, or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our solutions to remain competitive. our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of\noperations. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors either will refuse to license to us at all, or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.\nOur use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions.\nOur solutions incorporate open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. There is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of these licenses and therefore the potential impact of such licenses on our business is not fully known or predictable. There is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our solutions.\nWhile we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source license, such use could inadvertently occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-code or engineer one or more of our offerings, discontinue sales of one or more of our solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could cause us to breach obligations to our customers, harm our reputation, result in customer losses or claims, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results.\nU.S. federal tax reform could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law, which made significant changes to the Code. Among other changes, Section 163(j) of the Code was amended to limit the deductibility of net interest expense paid or accrued on debt properly allocable to a trade or business to 30% of \u201cadjusted taxable income,\u201d subject to certain exceptions. Any deduction in excess of the limitation is carried forward and may be used in a subsequent year, subject to the 30% limitation. Adjusted taxable income is determined without regard to certain deductions, including those for net interest expense, net operating loss carryforwards and, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, depreciation, amortization and depletion. While the impact of this rule is not completely clear and could change due to the issuance of additional interpretive guidance or changes in our level of indebtedness, we expect these rules will limit the amount of net interest expense that we and our subsidiaries can use as a deduction against taxable income and, as a result, may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nA write-off or acceleration of amortization of all or a part of our long-lived assets (including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill) would adversely affect our operating results and reduce our net worth.\nWe have significant long-lived assets which include property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, other noncurrent assets and goodwill. As of March 31, 2020, we had $206.2 million of property and equipment, $4,365.8 million of identifiable intangible assets, $338.9 million of other noncurrent assets and $3,795.3 million of goodwill on our balance sheet, which collectively represented in excess of 86% of our total assets. We amortize property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and relevant other noncurrent assets over their estimated useful lives. Though we are not permitted to amortize goodwill under GAAP, we evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually. In the event of anticipated obsolescence or impairment of our long-lived assets,\nwe may write-off all or part of the affected assets or accelerate the related amortization of these assets. We performed a goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020, and as a result of the expected impacts to our financial results arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $561.2 million. Other risks and future developments that we ae unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise future projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of reporting units in future periods. A write-off or acceleration of amortization in the future would result in an immediate one-time charge to earnings in the event of an impairment of assets and, in the event of anticipated obsolescence of assets that do not reach the level of an impairment, regular reductions to earnings over the remaining lives of the affected assets. Although it would not affect our cash flow, a write-off or acceleration of amortization in future periods of all or a part of these long-lived assets would adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to identify, recruit and retain skilled management and technical personnel. If we fail to recruit and retain suitable candidates or if our relationship with our employees changes or deteriorates, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur future success depends upon our continuing ability to identify, attract, hire and retain highly qualified personnel, including skilled management, product, technology, sales and marketing personnel, all of whom are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified personnel in the healthcare IT industry is intense, and we may not be able to hire or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to meet our requirements, or be able to do so at salary, benefit and other compensation costs that are acceptable to us. A loss of a substantial number of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for expansion of our business, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, while none of our employees currently are unionized, unionization of our employees is possible in the future. Such unionizing activities could be costly to address and, if successful, likely would adversely impact our operations.\nLengthy sales, installation and implementation cycles for some of our solutions may result in delays or an inability to generate revenue from these solutions.\nSome of our solutions have long sales, installation and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation and generation of revenue. How and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are important decisions for healthcare organizations, and some customers may be reluctant to change or modify existing systems or processes. Some of the solutions we provide require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by our customers. Sales may be subject to delays due to customers\u2019 internal procedures for deploying new systems and processes, and implementation may be subject to delays based on the availability of the internal customer resources needed. We may be unable to control many of the factors that will influence the timing of the buying decisions of existing or prospective customers or the pace at which installation and training may occur, including decisions by our customers to delay or cancel implementations. If we experience longer sales, installation and implementation cycles for our solutions, we may experience delays in generating, or a decreased ability to generate, revenue from these solutions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, significant delays or failures to meet milestones established in our customer contracts may result in breach of contract, termination of the contract, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue.\nWe may be a party to legal, regulatory and other proceedings that could result in unexpected adverse outcomes.\nFrom time to time, we have been, are and may in the future be, a party to legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations, including matters involving governmental agencies and entities with which we do business and other proceedings and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business, as described in more detail above. In addition, there are an increasing number of, and we may be subject to, investigations and proceedings in the healthcare industry generally that seek recovery under HIPAA, AKS, the FCA, the CMP, the Stark Law, the Sunshine Act, state laws and other statutes and regulations applicable to our business as described in more detail above. For example, we are currently subject to two overlapping putative class action complaints in Wisconsin federal court, alleging that we charged a fee to obtain certified healthcare bills for patients provided in the ordinary course of business in excess of Wisconsin state statutory limits. These and other similar statutory requirements impose statutory penalties for proven violations, which could become significant. While we intend to vigorously defend itself, the ultimate outcome and potential financial impact to us is not determinable at this time given the preliminary stage of these proceedings. We also may be subject to legal proceedings under non-healthcare federal, state and international laws affecting our business, such as the TCPA, FDCPA, FCRA, CAN-SPAM Act, Junk Fax Act, FCPA, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, GDPR, employment, banking and financial services and USPS laws and regulations, as further detailed above. Such proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. Governmental investigations, audits and other reviews could also result in criminal penalties or other sanctions, including restrictions, changes in the way we conduct business or exclusion from participation in government programs. We evaluate our exposure to these legal and regulatory proceedings and establish reserves for the estimated liabilities in accordance with GAAP. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in management\u2019s evaluations or predictions and accompanying changes in established reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nLitigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. The defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. Even if these matters are resolved in our favor, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation.\nThe failure to successfully implement a new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are in a multi-year process of implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) business solution to create a system of integrated applications to manage our businesses and automate many functions related to financial reporting, human resources and other services. It is our intent through this ERP to integrate the major facets of our organization in order to improve planning, development, processes, sales, human resources management and other applications as they affect our evolving business model. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that require transformations of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system; any such transformation involves risk inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations. Additionally, if the ERP system is not effectively implemented as planned, or the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed. Any failure(s) during this continued implementation process to develop, implement or maintain effective internal controls or to improve our internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties and are unable to effectively manage our business during or following the implementation of the ERP, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies. For example, in April 2019 we adopted ASC 606, which replaced most prior general and industry specific revenue recognition guidance with a principles-based comprehensive revenue recognition framework. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in significant changes to, among other things, how we report revenue resulting in increased expense to us and decreased comparability of our financial statements to prior historic periods. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our systems and incur additional costs. Such changes could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nSubstantial indebtedness of our subsidiaries could adversely affect our financial condition, adversely affect our ability to operate our business, adversely affect our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, adversely affect our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to meet obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nOur subsidiaries have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of March 31, 2020, our total was approximately $4,989.1 million. In addition, as of March 31, 2020, we had $529.9 million of availability to incur additional indebtedness under the senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d). On July 3, 2019 the commitment amount of the Revolving Facility was increased from $500.0 million to $785.0 million. Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) that governs the Revolving Facility and the senior secured term loan facility the (\u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Facility, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d) and the indenture that governs the senior notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to the high level of debt could increase. Specifically, the high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be difficult for our subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations, including debt service requirements under outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of cash flow from operations are required to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe could be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry is more limited;\n\u2022\nour ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to our competitors, may be compromised due to our high level of debt and the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement that governs the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance debt may be limited; and\n\u2022\nsuch indebtedness may cause potential or existing customers to not contract with it due to concerns over our ability to meet our financial obligations under such contracts.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors and reimbursement actions of governmental and commercial payers, all of which are beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable it to service our debt, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any refinancing or restructuring of the such indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require it to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare such indebtedness be due and payable and/or elect to exercise other rights, such as the lenders under the Revolving Facility terminating their commitments thereunder and ceasing to make further loans or the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities instituting foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, all of the debt under the Senior Credit Facilities bears interest at variable rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our Senior Credit Facilities would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe Credit Agreement that governs the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes each impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments;\n\u2022\ndesignate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be limited as to how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if they fail to do so, that they will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as the terms of any future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in it being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If our subsidiaries were forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR or the elimination of LIBOR could affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. Any changes adopted by the Financial Conduct Authority or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. We have material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR and is monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks.\nWe are dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries to pay taxes, pay any dividends, make any share repurchases and meet any debt obligations.\nWe have no material assets other than our ownership of our subsidiaries and therefore, no independent means of generating revenue. Our subsidiaries make distributions in amounts sufficient to cover all applicable taxes and dividends, if any, declared by us. Payments of dividends or repurchases of shares in the future, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. The existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Notes include, and any financing arrangement that we enter into in the future may include, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares.\nThe amounts we or our subsidiaries will be required to pay under their tax receivable agreements could be significant and, in certain circumstances, could differ significantly (in both timing and amount) from the underlying tax benefits they actually realize.\nChange, the Joint Venture and Change Healthcare Performance, Inc. (collectively, the \u201cTRA Affiliates\u201d), are a party to certain tax receivable agreements (collectively, the \u201ctax receivable agreements\u201d) and other similar agreements with current and former owners. One of the existing tax receivable agreements (the \u201cMcKesson Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d) generally provides for the payment by the Joint Venture to affiliates of McKesson (the \u201cMcKesson TRA Parties\u201d) of 85% of certain cash tax savings realized (or, in certain circumstances, deemed to be realized) by us and our subsidiaries in certain periods ending on or after the date on which McKesson ceases to own at least 20% of the Joint Venture (i.e. for periods commencing March 31, 2020 and onwards) as a result of (i) certain amortizable tax basis in assets transferred to the Joint Venture at the consummation of the Joint Venture Transactions and (ii) imputed interest deductions and certain other tax attributes arising from payments under the McKesson Tax Receivable Agreement. Change, the Joint Venture, McKesson and certain of McKesson\u2019s affiliates have also entered into an amended and restated letter agreement (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which McKesson may choose to allocate an amount of deductions related to certain amortizable tax basis in assets transferred to the Joint Venture at the consummation of the Joint Venture Transactions to us in excess of a specified minimum threshold, in which case we may be required to make cash payments to McKesson equal to 100% of our tax savings attributable to such excess deductions for any tax period ending prior to the date on which McKesson ceases to own at least 20% of the Joint Venture. Because McKesson ceased to own at least 20% of the Joint Venture during the year ended March 31, 2020, the Letter Agreement applies only to tax benefits obtained in the periods ended March 31, 2019 and earlier, of which we estimate there are none.\nAnother existing tax receivable agreement (the \u201c2017 Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d) generally provides for the payment by Change Healthcare Performance, Inc. to affiliates of the Sponsors and certain other former stockholders of Change Healthcare Performance, Inc. (the \u201c2017 TRA Parties\u201d) of 85% of the net cash tax savings realized (or, in certain circumstances, deemed to be realized) by Change Healthcare Performance, Inc. and our subsidiaries in respect of periods ending on or after the Joint Venture Transactions as a result of certain net operating losses and certain other tax attributes of Change Healthcare Performance, Inc. as of the date of the Joint Venture Transactions.\nA predecessor to Change Healthcare Performance, Inc. is party to certain tax receivable agreements (the \u201c2009-2011 Tax Receivable Agreements,\u201d and together with the 2017 Tax Receivable Agreement, the \u201cLegacy CHC Tax Receivable Agreements\u201d) which were assumed by the Joint Venture in connection with the Joint Venture Transactions and obligate the Joint Venture to make payments to certain of the former Legacy CHC Stockholders (the \u201c2009-2011 CHC TRA Parties,\u201d and collectively, with the McKesson TRA Parties and the 2017 TRA Parties, the \u201cTRA Parties\u201d), equal to 85% of the applicable cash savings that the Joint Venture realizes (or is deemed to realize) as a result of tax attributes arising from certain previous transactions. Because covered changes of control with respect to the 2009-2011 Tax Receivable Agreements previously occurred as a result of the Joint Venture Transactions and other previous reorganizations, payments the Joint Venture makes under the 2009-2011 Tax Receivable Agreements are calculated using certain valuation assumptions, including that the Joint Venture will have sufficient taxable income to use the applicable tax attributes and that certain of such tax attributes will be used by the Joint Venture on a pro rata basis from the date of the Joint Venture Transactions (or in certain cases from the date of certain previous transactions) through the expiration of the applicable tax attribute.\nThe payments the TRA Affiliates may be required to make under these tax receivable agreements could be substantial. The amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreements will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable. We expect that, assuming no material changes in tax law and that the Joint Venture earns sufficient taxable income to realize the full potential tax benefit of the tax attributes in respect of which it is required to make payments under the Legacy CHC Tax Receivable Agreements and McKesson Tax Receivable Agreements, future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will range from $17.6 million to $85.8 million per year over the next 11 years and from $0.0 to $13.7 million per year over the following 10 years. As of March 31, 2020, we expect total remaining payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements of approximately $479.4 million. See Note 17, Tax Receivable Agreement Obligations within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Because payments under the McKesson Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon McKesson\u2019s determination to allocate certain excess deductions to us, which may be subject to change until the filing of a tax return for a relevant period, the amount of any payments under such agreement may change if McKesson alters the allocations estimated as of March 31, 2020 prior to filing the tax return for the period.\nThere may be circumstances in which the payments under the tax receivable agreements differ significantly (in both timing and amount) from the underlying tax benefits the TRA Affiliates actually realize. Pursuant to the tax receivable agreements, upon a covered change of control, the TRA Affiliates could be required to make payments that significantly exceed the actual cash tax savings from the tax benefits giving rise to such payments. As noted above, with respect to the 2009-2011 Tax Receivable Agreements, covered changes of control previously occurred as a result of the Joint Venture Transactions and other previous reorganizations. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the TRA Affiliates will have the option to terminate the tax receivable agreements in exchange for a lump-sum payment (based on an assumption that all expected potential tax benefits actually will be realized). In addition, under the tax receivable agreements, none of the TRA Parties will reimburse the TRA Affiliates for any payments previously made if such tax benefits are subsequently disallowed, except that excess payments made to a TRA Party will be netted against payments otherwise to be made, if any, after the determination of such excess. As a result, in such circumstances, the TRA Affiliates could make payments under the tax receivable agreements that are greater than the actual cash tax savings and may not be able to recoup those payments. Any difference between the payments the TRA Affiliates are required to make under the tax\nreceivable agreements and the underlying tax benefits actually realized could adversely affect our business or financial condition. Furthermore, because certain of the TRA Affiliates are holding companies with no operations of their own, their ability to make payments under each relevant tax receivable agreement is substantially dependent on the ability of their subsidiaries to make distributions to them. To the extent that the TRA Affiliates are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreements for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.\nWe continue to rely on McKesson and our affiliates for certain transition services. The inability or unwillingness of McKesson or our affiliates to provide such services in a timely or effective manner could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe continue to rely on McKesson to provide us with certain services for our business and customers pursuant to the terms of a transition services agreement (the \u201cMcKesson Transition Services Agreement\u201d). Certain of these services are essential to our efficient operation. After the transition period, we may be unable to provide these services internally because of financial or other constraints, and we may be unable to implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. In addition, McKesson may fail to perform such transition services in a timely or effective manner, or at all, during the term of the McKesson Transition Services Agreement, either due to our inability or unwillingness to continue such services or for other reasons. If there is an interruption in such services prior to expiration of the McKesson Transition Services Agreement, or if such services are inadequate, we will be required to provide these services itself or to obtain substitute arrangements with third parties on a faster timeline than anticipated, which may be challenging without significant effort or expense. Any failure by McKesson to perform such transition services, or any failure by us to replace such transition services with acceptable arrangements when necessary, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See \u201cOther Agreements and Other Related Party Transactions-Transition Services Agreements.\u201d\nOur internal controls over financial reporting currently do not meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and common stock price.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting currently do not meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that eventually we will be required to meet. Because currently we do not have comprehensive documentation of our internal controls and have not yet tested our internal controls in accordance with Section 404, we cannot conclude in accordance with Section 404 that it does not have a material weakness in our internal controls or a combination of significant deficiencies that could result in the conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal controls. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, which we expect to occur with respect to fiscal year 2021, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. If we are not able to complete our initial assessment of our internal controls and otherwise implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nMatters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules, which may result in a breach of the covenants under existing or future financing arrangements. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in the price of our Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our Common Stock, the price and trading volume of our Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Common Stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price of our Common Stock may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our Common Stock to decline and our Common Stock to be less liquid.\nYou may be diluted by the future issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,696,600,000 shares of our Common Stock authorized but unissued. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue authorized but unissued shares of our Common Stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to our Common Stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in our sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Additionally, there are an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, 19,114,543 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under or that may otherwise vest pursuant to outstanding equity awards issued pursuant to our legacy 2009 equity incentive plan and an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d). Any Common Stock that we issue, including under our Omnibus Incentive Plan, our legacy 2009 equity incentive plan, our ESPP or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we also have 5,137,345 TEUs outstanding. Unless settled earlier as described below, each purchase contract that is a component of a TEU will settle automatically on the mandatory settlement date into between 3.2051 and 3.8461 shares of our Common Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement will be determined based on the average volume weighted average price per share of Common Stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on and including the 21st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the mandatory settlement date in accordance with the purchase contract agreement. Assuming automatic settlement at the rate of 3.8461 shares of Common Stock per purchase contract assuming the maximum number of shares issuable upon automatic settlement of such purchase contracts, up to 2,181,086 shares of Common Stock are issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts that are a component of the TEUs, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments.\nAt any time prior to the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding June 30, 2022, holders of the purchase contracts may elect to settle purchase contracts early and we will deliver shares of our Common Stock at the minimum settlement rate of shares of our Common Stock per purchase contract, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. If holders elect to settle any purchase contracts early in connection with a fundamental change, such purchase contracts will be settled at the fundamental change early settlement rate, which may be greater than the minimum settlement rate. See \u201cDescription of Change Healthcare Inc. Tangible Equity Units.\u201d\nAny of these issuances may dilute your ownership interest and any of these events or the perception that these events and/or issuances could occur may have an adverse impact on the price of our Common Stock.\nOur TEUs may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nThe market price of our Common Stock is likely to be influenced by the TEUs. For example, the market price of our Common Stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our Common Stock received upon settlement of the purchase contracts that are a component of the TEUs;\n\u2022\npossible sales of our Common Stock by investors who view the TEUs as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our Common Stock; and\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving the TEUs and our Common Stock.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Common Stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Common Stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Common Stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that might be assigned to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Common Stock.\nSales or issuances of a substantial amount of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, particularly sales by directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales or issuances may occur, or the settlement of the purchase contracts, could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline and may make it more difficult for investors to sell their common stock at a time and price that they deem appropriate.\nThe sale or issuance of substantial amounts of shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Common Stock in the public market, or the settlement of the purchase contracts that are a component of the TEUs, or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our Common Stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Future sales or issuances of our Common Stock or other equity-related securities could be dilutive to our stockholders and could adversely affect their voting and other rights and economic interests, including holders of any shares of our Common Stock issued upon settlement of the purchase contracts. Our stockholders, including holders of any shares of our Common Stock issued upon settlement of the purchase contracts, may also experience additional dilution upon future vesting events, equity issuances, exercise of options to purchase our Common Stock or the settlement of restricted stock units granted to employees, executive officers and directors.\nBeginning on June 8, 2020, certain of our legacy stockholders that continue to own a substantial amount of our Common Stock will have the right, subject to certain exceptions and conditions, to require us to register our shares of Common Stock owned by them under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and they will have the right to participate in future registrations of securities by us. Registration of any of these outstanding shares of our Common Stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement.\nThe market price of shares of our Common Stock could drop significantly if these stockholders are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our Common Stock or other securities.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts that you might consider favorable.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of us more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nwould allow us to authorize the issuance of shares of one or more series of preferred stock, including in connection with a stockholder rights plan, financing transactions or otherwise, the terms of which series may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the date on which the parties to our stockholders agreement and their affiliates cease to beneficially own at least 30% of the total voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office;\n\u2022\nprovide for certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprovide (i) that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our Amended and Restated Bylaws and (ii) that, at any time the Sponsors beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 30% in voting power of the stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, our stockholders may only amend our Amended and Restated Bylaws with the approval of 80% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impede or discourage a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of us, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or could negatively affect the trading price of our Common Stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. For a further discussion of these and other such anti-takeover provisions, see \u201cDescription of Change Healthcare Inc. Capital Stock-Anti-Takeover Effects of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and Certain Provisions of Delaware Law.\u201d\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, stockholder or employees, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws or (iv) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is not the sole and exclusive forum for actions brought under the federal securities laws. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act\nor the rules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary therein, the forum selection provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the federal securities laws or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. These choice-of-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a different judicial forum, including one that it may find favorable or convenient for specified class of disputes with us or our directors, officers, other stockholders or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.", "PERMNO": 18771, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "CHNG"}
