{"cik": "949157", "company": "CENTURY ALUMINUM CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following describes certain of the risks and uncertainties we face that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation, and cause our future results to differ materially from our current results and from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements. These risk factors should be considered together with the other risks and uncertainties described in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere herein. This list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.\nDeclines in aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nOur operating results depend on the market for primary aluminum. Primary aluminum is a globally traded commodity and its price is effectively determined on the London Metal Exchange (the \"LME\") and other exchanges, plus any regional delivery premiums and value-added product premiums. Because primary aluminum is a global commodity, the price for aluminum can be volatile and subject to many factors beyond our control. The LME price is influenced by a number of factors, including global supply-demand balance, inventory levels, speculative activities by market participants, production activities by competitors, political and economic conditions, as well as production costs in major production regions. Regional premiums are generally influenced by the supply-demand balance for a particular region and associated transportation costs. Product premiums reflect the supply-demand balance for particular shapes and alloys.\nReflecting this volatility, during 2017, the average LME price for primary aluminum was $1,968 per tonne, compared to $1,604 per tonne in 2016 and $1,663 per tonne in 2015. During 2017, the average U.S. Midwest premium was $199 per tonne, compared to $169 per tonne in 2016 and $279 per tonne in 2015. During 2017, the average European Duty Paid premium was $148 per tonne, compared to $132 per tonne in 2016 and $236 in 2015. There can be no assurance that recent volatility in the price of aluminum will not continue.\nDeclines in the aluminum price have a direct impact on our results of operations. As a result of price declines in 2015, we curtailed production at our Hawesville smelter, which continues to operate at approximately 40% of capacity, and took other actions to reduce our cost of production, including deferring certain capital expenditures and maintenance costs and implementing workforce reductions. Future declines in the aluminum price could result in additional curtailments of our operations and additional cost cutting measures. Any deferred costs could ultimately result in higher capital expenditures and maintenance costs than would have been incurred had such costs not been deferred and increase the costs to restore production to capacity if market forces warrant.\nDeclines in the market price for aluminum could also reduce our liquidity due to lower borrowing availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility (caused by lower market value of our inventory and accounts receivable). Declines in aluminum prices (and regional delivery, product and other premiums) may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations.\nExcess capacity and over production of aluminum products may continue to materially disrupt world aluminum markets causing price deterioration and, in turn, adversely impact our sales, margins and profitability.\nWorld aluminum prices have been significantly depressed in recent years due to large amounts of excess capacity and over production in China and other regions. Significant portions of world aluminum production would not be possible without financial and other support from governments and state-owned entities. This oversupply has caused world aluminum prices to be adversely impacted. Continued over production and the improper export of heavily subsidized aluminum products may continue to materially disrupt world aluminum markets resulting in depressed prices and, in turn, materially adversely impact our sales, margins and profitability.\nIncreases in energy costs adversely affect our business.\nElectrical power represents one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. As a result, the availability of electricity at competitive prices is critical to the profitability of our operations.\nOur Hawesville and Sebree plants receive all of their electricity requirements under market-based electricity contracts, and our Mt. Holly plant receives 75% of its electricity requirements under a market-based contract. Market-based electricity contracts expose us to market price volatility and fluctuations driven primarily by coal and natural gas prices and weather-influenced electric loads. In 2017, both coal and natural gas prices were relatively low, weather conditions were moderate and the energy prices we realized under these agreements were competitive. However, electrical power prices can fluctuate (for instance, as a result of extreme weather conditions), without any direct relationship to the price of aluminum. There can be no assurance that our market-based power supply arrangements at our Hawesville, Sebree and Mt. Holly plants will result in favorable electricity costs.\nPower is currently supplied to Grundartangi from hydroelectric and geothermal sources under long-term power purchase agreements with HS Orka hf (\"HS\"), Landsvirkjun and Orkuveita Reykjavikur (\"OR\") at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum. Linking the price of power to the price of aluminum provides a natural hedge of our largest production cost. Beginning in November 2019, one of our contracts (covering approximately 30% percent of our current power requirements at Grundartangi) will be priced linked to the market price for power in the Nord Pool power market, which will expose us to market price volatility and fluctuations based on the market price for power in the Nordic countries and certain other areas of Europe. These markets can fluctuate significantly.\nAny increase in our electricity and energy prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we are unable to enter into a long term, market-based, power arrangement for Mt. Holly, we may choose, or be forced, to further curtail operations at the plant.\nMt. Holly is currently required to purchase 25% of its power requirements from Santee Cooper's generation at a standard cost-based industrial rate, which is the highest rate paid for power by any U.S. smelter and substantially higher than the rate Mt. Holly pays for market power. Mt. Holly's inability to access the open market for 100% of its power requirements significantly impacts its ability to be competitive in the aluminum industry. As a result of such uncompetitive power prices, Mt. Holly has curtailed 50% of its production capacity. In January 2017, we filed an antitrust lawsuit against Santee Cooper seeking damages and injunctive relief, including the ability to purchase 100% of Mt. Holly's power from the open market. In October 2017, the District Court granted Santee Cooper's motion to dismiss this lawsuit and we subsequently appealed the decision of the District Court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. As a result of such lawsuit, Santee Cooper may seek to take actions detrimental to Mt. Holly, including altering the terms and price of its current service to Mt. Holly. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal or how long it may take to come to resolution. If we are unable to secure a long term power arrangement for 100% of Mt. Holly's power requirements on competitive terms, we may choose, or be forced, to further curtail operations at the plant.\nClosure of the Mt. Holly facility would impose various costs on us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and could cause us to write down the book value of the Mt. Holly facility. In addition, the ongoing uncertainty regarding the future operation of Mt. Holly may damage our relationships with our customers, suppliers, employees and other stakeholders and decrease the price we receive for our products, whether or not Mt. Holly is ultimately closed. Such actions and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nLosses caused by disruptions in our supply of power would adversely affect our operations.\nWe use large amounts of electricity to produce primary aluminum. Any loss or disruption of the power supply which reduces the amperage to our equipment or causes an equipment shutdown would result in a reduction in the volume of molten aluminum produced, and prolonged losses of power may result in the hardening or \"freezing\" of molten aluminum in the pots where it is produced, which could require an expensive and time consuming restart process. Disruptions in the supply of electrical power to our facilities can be caused by a number of circumstances, including unusually high demand, blackouts, equipment or transformer failure, human error, malicious acts, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Our market-based power supply arrangements further increase the risk that disruptions in the supply of electrical power to our domestic operations could occur. Under these arrangements, we have greater exposure to transmission line outages, problems with grid stability and limitations on energy import capability. An alternative supply of power in the event of a disruption may not be feasible. If a disruption in the supply of electrical power at one of our facilities were to occur, we may lose production for a prolonged period of time, experience pot instability that could decrease levels of productivity and incur significant losses. Such a condition may also force a curtailment of all or part of the production at any of these facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe operate our plants at close to peak amperage. Accordingly, even partial failures of high voltage equipment could affect our production. We maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events, but are required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies. In addition, the coverage under those policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses, or may not cover certain events. Certain of our insurance policies do not cover any losses that may be incurred if our suppliers are unable to provide power under certain circumstances. Certain losses or prolonged interruptions in our operations may trigger a default under certain of our outstanding indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIncreases in our raw material costs and disruptions in our supply adversely affect our business.\nOur business also depends upon the adequate supply of alumina, aluminum fluoride, calcined petroleum coke, pitch, carbon anodes and cathodes and other materials. The availability of our raw materials at competitive prices is critical to the profitability of our operations and increases in pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Some of our supply agreements have variable pricing and can be subject to factors beyond our control. For example, the pricing under our current alumina supply contracts is based on a published alumina index. As a result, our cost structure is exposed to market price volatility and fluctuations. Because we sell our products based on the LME price for primary aluminum, we would not be able to pass on to our customers any increased costs of raw material that are not linked to the LME price.\nIn addition, disruptions to the supply of these production inputs could occur for a variety of reasons, including disruptions of production at a particular supplier\u2019s facility or power plant. Any supply disruption may require us to purchase these products on less favorable terms than under our current agreements due to the limited number of suppliers of these products or other market conditions. In some instances, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply of these resources. Any disruption in our materials or electricity supply may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to secure alternate supplies of materials at comparable prices or at all.\nFor some of these production inputs, such as alumina and anode supply, we rely on a limited number of suppliers. Many of our supply agreements are short term or expire in the next few years. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to renew such agreements at commercially favorable terms, if at all.\nCurtailment of aluminum production at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe continued operation of our smelters depends on the market for primary aluminum and our underlying cost of production. Due to significant declines in the aluminum price during 2015, we made the decision to curtail 60% of production at our Hawesville smelter. We are also currently operating our Mt. Holly smelter at 50% capacity as a result of uncompetitive power prices. There can be no assurance that continued or future deterioration in the price of aluminum or increases in our costs of production will not result in additional production curtailments at our smelters.\nCurtailing production requires us to incur substantial expenses, both at the time of the curtailment and on an ongoing basis. Our facilities are subject to contractual and other fixed costs that continue even if we curtail operations at these facilities. These costs reduce the cost saving advantages of curtailing unprofitable aluminum production. If we are unable to realize the intended cost saving effects of any production curtailment, we may have to seek bankruptcy protection or be forced to divest some or all of our assets. The process of restarting production following curtailment is also expensive and time consuming. As a result, any decision to restart production would likely require market conditions significantly better than the market conditions at the time the decision to curtail was made. Any curtailments of our operations, or actions taken to seek bankruptcy protection or divest some or all of our assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our capital projects.\nFrom time to time, we undertake strategic capital projects in order to enhance, expand and/or upgrade our facilities and operational capabilities. For instance, within the past several years, we have undertaken major expansions of our Grundartangi and Vlissingen facilities. Our ability to complete these projects and the timing and costs of doing so are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, the start-up of operations after such projects have been completed is also subject to risk. Our ability to achieve the anticipated increased revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on these investments is subject to a variety of market, operational, permitting, and labor-related factors. Any failure to complete these projects, or any delays or failure to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of any such projects, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could adversely affect our business.\nThe bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Hawesville, Sebree and Vlissingen facilities are represented by labor unions, representing approximately 65% of our total workforce as of December 31, 2017. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with any labor union representing our employees, our labor contracts may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at any of these facilities in the future. As part of any negotiation with a labor union, we may reach agreements with respect to future wages and benefits that may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, negotiations could divert management attention or result in strikes, lock-outs or other work stoppages. Any threatened or actual work stoppage in the future or inability to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements could prevent or significantly impair our ability to conduct production operations at our facilities subject to these collective bargaining agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nCertain of our raw material and services contracts contain \"take-or-pay\" obligations.\nWe have obligations under certain contracts to take-or-pay for specified raw materials or services over the term of those contracts regardless of our operating requirements. To the extent that we curtail production at any of our operations, we may continue to be obligated to take or pay for goods or services under these contracts as if we were operating at full production, which reduces the cost savings advantages of curtailing aluminum production. Our financial position and results of operations may also be adversely affected by the market price for such materials or services as we will continue to incur costs under these contracts to meet or settle our contractual take-or-pay obligations. If we were unable to use such materials or services in our operations or sell them at prices consistent with or greater than our contract costs, we could incur significant losses under these contracts. In addition, these commitments may also limit our ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for such materials and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe have historically derived substantially all of our revenue from a small number of customers, and we could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or changes in the business or financial condition of our major customers.\nWe have historically derived substantially all of our consolidated net sales from a small number of customers. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, we derived approximately 89% and 75%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales from Glencore and we currently have agreements in place to sell a substantial portion of our 2018 and 2019 production to Glencore. We expect that the rest of our 2018 customer base will remain fairly concentrated among a small number of customers under short-term contracts.\nAny material non-payment or non-performance by one of these customers, a significant dispute with one of these customers, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of any of these customers, early termination of our sales agreement with any of these customers, or any other event significantly negatively impacting the contractual relationship with one of these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If, in such an event, we are unable to sell the affected production volume to another customer, or we sell the affected production to another customer on terms that are materially less advantageous to us, our revenues could be negatively impacted.\nInternational operations expose us to political, regulatory, currency and other related risks.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues and cash flow from our operations in Iceland. These operations expose us to risks, including unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations, political and economic instability, challenges in managing foreign operations, increased costs to adapt our systems and practices to those used in foreign countries, taxes, export duties, currency restrictions and exchange, tariffs and other trade barriers, and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of\nforeign laws and regulations. Changes in foreign laws and regulations are generally beyond our ability to control, influence or predict and future adverse changes in these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn addition, we may be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result, an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could increase our operating expenses which are denominated and payable in those currencies. To the extent we explore additional opportunities outside the U.S., our currency risk with respect to the Icelandic krona, the euro and other foreign currencies may increase.\nBecause we own less than a majority of BHH, we cannot exercise complete control over its operations.\nWe have a joint venture agreement pursuant to which we hold a 40% stake in BHH, a carbon anode and cathode facility located in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of south China. Because we beneficially own less than a majority of the ownership interests in BHH, we have limited control of the operations of this facility and we must depend in part on our co-owner to operate such assets. Our co-owner may have interests, objectives and incentives with respect to such assets that differ from our own and there can be no assurance that BHH will be operated in accordance with our best interests.\nWe require substantial resources to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures.\nWe require substantial resources to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures and other obligations, our ability to continue to meet these cash requirements in the future could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including from capital and credit markets.\nIf funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unacceptable terms, we may be unable to respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities or fund operations, capital expenditure or other obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nA deterioration in our financial condition or credit rating could limit our ability to access the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms or to enter into hedging and financial transactions, and could adversely affect our financial condition and our business relationships.\nOur credit rating has been adversely affected by unfavorable market and financial conditions. Our existing credit rating, or any future negative actions the credit agencies may take, could increase our borrowing costs, limiting our ability to access the credit and capital markets, and have an adverse effect on our relationships with customers, suppliers and hedging counterparties. An inability to access the credit and capital markets when needed in order to refinance our existing debt or raise new debt or equity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe require significant cash flow to meet our debt service requirements, which increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, reduces cash available for other purposes and limits our operational flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of approximately $256 million of outstanding debt and we may incur additional debt in the future.\nThe level of our debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nreducing cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, working capital and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, competitive and other changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nWe have various obligations to make payments in cash, including contractual commitments, pension funding, and certain contingent obligations, that will reduce the amount of cash available to make interest payments required on our outstanding debt and for other uses. Our industrial revenue bonds (\"IRBs\") and any borrowings on our U.S. and Iceland revolving credit facilities are at variable interest rates, and future borrowings required to fund working capital at our businesses, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions, or other strategic opportunities may be at variable rates. An increase in interest rates would increase our debt service obligations under these instruments, further limiting cash flow available for other uses.\nOur ability to pay interest on and to repay or refinance our debt and to satisfy other commitments will depend upon our access to additional sources of liquidity and future operating performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, including market prices for primary aluminum, that are beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay debt service obligations, refinance our existing debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we could attempt to restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity or debt capital. There can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish those actions on satisfactory terms, or at all, and if we are unable to ultimately meet our debt service obligations and fund our other liquidity needs, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nDespite our substantial level of debt, we may incur more debt, which could exacerbate any or all of the risks described above.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the loan and security agreement governing our U.S. revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the 7.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\") limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the loan and security agreement governing our U.S. revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the 2021 Notes do not prevent us from incurring certain obligations that do not constitute debt as defined in these agreements. To the extent that we incur additional debt or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial debt described above, including our possible inability to service our debt or other obligations, would increase.\nOur debt instruments subject us to covenants and restrictions.\nOur existing debt instruments contain various covenants that restrict the way we conduct our business and limit our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and engage in transactions such as acquisitions and investments, among other things, which may impair our ability to obtain additional liquidity and grow our business. Any failure to comply with those covenants would likely constitute a breach under such debt instruments which may result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness and termination of commitments under our revolving credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may be unable to repay the required amounts and our secured lenders could foreclose on any collateral securing our secured debt. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe depend upon intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations.\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, our results of operations depend on the results of operations of our subsidiaries. Moreover, our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon the receipt of intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and any restrictions or prohibitions on intercompany transfers by those subsidiaries contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries.\nThe failure of our information technology systems and/or difficulties or delays in implementing new information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe depend on our information technology systems to effectively manage significant aspects of our business including, without limitation, production process control, metal inventory management, and reporting financial and operational results. We are currently in the process of a company-wide deployment of a new enterprise resource planning system. Deployment of new information systems and technologies involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation, or transition of such systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our business, and/or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results.\nOur information technology systems may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances largely beyond our control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failure, security breaches, and cyber-attacks, which include viruses, malware, and ransom attacks. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, continue to become more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other\nelectronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data.\nWe have taken measures to minimize the risks related to information technology systems. However, there is no assurance that these measures will be adequate. Any failure or interruption of our current information technology systems, and/or any failure resulting from a transition to new information technology systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nClimate change legislation or environmental regulations may adversely impact our operations.\nClimate change and greenhouse gas emissions have been the subject of significant public and scientific attention in the countries in which we operate. In turn, increasing government attention is being paid to global climate issues and to emissions of greenhouse gases, including emissions of carbon dioxide from coal combustion by power plants. A number of governments or governmental bodies in these countries have introduced legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change.\nFor example, in October 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") adopted the Clean Power Plan which would require states to meet significant carbon emission reduction standards. These regulations could have a variety of adverse effects on our business. Electricity represents our single largest operating cost and the availability of electricity at competitive prices is critical to the profitability of our operations. Some of the power we purchase in the United States is generated at coal-based power plants, which are likely to be significantly impacted by these regulations. For example, these regulations could require permanent closure of significant amounts of coal-based power generation. Replacement generation would likely be more expensive, including substantial amounts of renewable generation, which additional costs would likely be passed down to us in the form of higher rates. This could significantly increase our operating costs which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Even small increases in power prices could have a disproportionate impact on our business if such price increases are not supported by then current aluminum prices. Certain states have challenged the Clean Power Plan and, in October 2017, the EPA announced its proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan in its entirety on the grounds that that the plan is illegal because it goes beyond the government's authority. The potential impact of these regulations on us will depend on the form in which these regulations are ultimately implemented, if at all.\nIn addition, as a member of the European Economic Area and a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, Iceland has implemented legislation to abide by the Kyoto Protocol and to prepare to abide by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament which establishes a \"cap and trade\" scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading. Iceland is complying with the Directive by participating in the European Union (\"EU\") Emission Trade Scheme from January 1, 2013. Although we will receive approximately 70% of needed carbon dioxide allowances for the Grundartangi smelter free of charge, the economic impact of implementing this system is not fully known as cost of allowances could rise.\nImplementation of these or other potential regulatory changes is uncertain and may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from compliance with such regulatory changes, increased energy costs, costs associated with a \"cap and trade\" system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in cost of goods sold. For example, \"cap and trade\" legislation may impose significant additional costs to our power suppliers that could lead to significant increases in our energy costs. In addition, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. Any adverse regulatory and physical changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe and our suppliers are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are obligated to comply with various foreign, federal, state and other environmental laws and regulations, including the environmental laws and regulations of the United States, Iceland, China and the EU. Environmental laws and regulations may expose us to costs or liabilities relating to our manufacturing operations or property ownership. We incur operating costs and capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We also are currently, and may in the future be, responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former facilities or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources. If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental\nlaws or regulations are imposed, previously unknown environmental conditions or damages to natural resources are discovered or alleged, or if contributions from other responsible parties with respect to sites for which we have cleanup responsibilities are not available, we may be subject to additional liability, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Further, additional environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known, with respect to sites previously owned or operated by us, by related corporate entities or by our predecessors, or at sites that we may acquire or operate in the future. In addition, overall production costs may become prohibitively expensive and prevent us from effectively competing in price sensitive markets if future capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance or cleanup are significantly greater than expected.\nIn addition, many of our key suppliers are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may affect their costs of production resulting in an increase in the price of the products that we purchase from them. For instance, some of the power we purchase in the United States is generated at coal-based power plants, which are subject to significant environmental regulation. Application of existing and new environmental laws and regulations to us and/or our key suppliers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our employees, and changes in health and safety regulation could result in significant costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal and state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our workers. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures or impose restrictions on our operations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d). On January 9, 2017, OSHA published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium, contained in alumina. The new standard would, among other things, lower the permissible exposure limits and establish new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping, among others. Companies are required to comply with certain elements of the new standard by March 12, 2018; however, we have filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals to review the final rule and are in negotiations with OSHA to make certain changes to the rule and delay the compliance dates. In the event we are unable to reach an agreement with OSHA, we will proceed with our petition challenging the rule. Compliance with the new standard in its current form would require significant capital expenditure and would likely increase our production costs. The ultimate impact, if any, of this new standard will depend on the nature and extent of the final rule as implemented, the cost of and our ability to meet the new standard, the potential impact on alumina costs, and other factors. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our workers may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on the our business and results of operations.\nGlencore may exercise substantial influence over us, and they may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders.\nGlencore beneficially owns approximately 42.9% of our outstanding common stock and all of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred stock. In addition, one of our five directors is a Glencore employee. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived approximately 75% of our consolidated sales from Glencore and we expect to sell a significant portion of our production to Glencore in 2018. Century and Glencore enter into various transactions such as the purchase and sale of primary aluminum, purchase and sale of alumina, tolling agreements and certain forward financial contracts. Because of the interests described above, Glencore may have substantial influence over our business, and on the outcome of any matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nIn addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest between Glencore and our other stockholders. For example, Glencore may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in our industry that may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us. In addition, because of the interests described above, any future agreements or arrangements that we enter into with Glencore may not be comparable to those we could have negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe have a history of making acquisitions and we expect to opportunistically seek to make acquisitions in the future. We are subject to numerous risks as a result of our acquisition strategy, including the following:\n\u2022we may spend time and money pursuing acquisitions that do not close;\n\u2022acquired companies may have contingent or unidentified liabilities;\n\u2022it may be challenging for us to manage our existing business as we integrate acquired operations; and\n\u2022we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions.\nWe are subject to numerous risks following the consummation of any acquisition, including, for example, that we may incur costs and expenses associated with any unidentified or potential liabilities, we may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits from the acquisitions and unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating the acquired operations into our existing operations. Accordingly, our past or future acquisitions might not ultimately improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and may subject us to additional liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change\" under the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.5 billion which could offset future taxable income. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future federal taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change\" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). In general, an ownership change would occur if our \"five-percent shareholders,\" as defined under the Code, collectively increase their ownership in us by more than fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Future transactions in our stock that may not be in our control may cause us to experience such an ownership change and thus limit our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits and other tax assets to offset future taxable income.\nWe may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry. Aluminum also competes with other materials, such as steel, copper, plastics, composite materials and glass, among others, for various applications. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and technical resources than we do. These larger competitors may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions. Similarly, many of our competitors have vertically integrated upstream operations with resulting superior cost positions to ours and may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions. If we are not able to compete successfully, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnpredictable events may interrupt our operations, which, may adversely affect our business.\nOur operations may be susceptible to unpredictable events, including accidents, transportation and supply interruptions, labor disputes, equipment failure, information system breakdowns, natural disasters, dangerous weather conditions, river conditions, political unrest and other events. Operational malfunctions or interruptions at one or more of our facilities could result in substantial losses in our production capacity, personal injury or death, damage to our properties or the properties of others, monetary losses and potential legal liability.\nIceland, for example, suffered several natural disasters and extreme weather events in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016, including significant volcanic eruptions and earthquakes which can lead to disruption in power transmission or other impacts to our operations. Insufficient rain in Iceland has and could in the future lead to low water levels in the reservoirs which has and may again result in curtailments in power which is provided to our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter from hydroelectric and geothermal sources.\nWe accept delivery of necessary raw materials to our operations using public infrastructure such as river systems and seaports. Deterioration of such infrastructure and/or other adverse conditions could result in transportation delays or interruptions and increased costs, as occurred during the third quarter of 2017 when lock closures on the Ohio River impacted our alumina supply and forced us to find alternative means to transport alumina to our Kentucky operations at increased cost. Any delay in the delivery of raw materials necessary for our production could impact our ability to operate our plants and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nFuture unpredictable events may adversely affect our ability to conduct business and may require substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage and restore operations at our production facilities. Although we maintain\ninsurance to mitigate losses resulting from such events, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses, may have high deductibles or may not cover certain events at all. To the extent these losses are not covered by insurance, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 83244, "SIC": 3350, "TIC": "CENX"}
