RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance. Because of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of numerous factors, any one of which could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or guidance, making our future results difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing and volatile global economic environment, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You\nshould not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. A significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last month of the quarter, often within the last few weeks or days of the quarter. As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term and a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year. A delay in the recognition of revenue, even from just one account, may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, as has occurred recently and at other times in the past, or if the guidance we provide to the market falls below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, as has occurred recently and at other times in the past, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. For example, in January 2015, we preannounced results for fourth quarter revenues that were lower than originally forecast. Following such preannouncement, the market price of our stock declined nearly 21% the following trading day. Such a stock price decline could occur, and has occurred in the past, even when we have met our publicly stated revenue and/or earnings guidance.\nIn addition to other risks listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand, including due to seasonality, for our products and services. For example, many companies in our industry experience adverse seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns, particularly in the first and third quarters; we have experienced these seasonal fluctuations in the past and expect that this trend will continue in the future;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in sales cycles, including the timing of large orders, and prices for our products and services;\n\u2022\ngiven the long lead times for the manufacture of our products, our ability to manage and maintain an appropriate level of product inventory in order to be able to ship products ordered during a quarter;\n\u2022\nreductions in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic or political conditions in our domestic and international markets;\n\u2022\nlimited visibility into customer spending plans;\n\u2022\nchanging market conditions, including current and potential customer consolidation;\n\u2022\nvariation in sales channels, product costs or mix of products sold;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter as a result of revenue recognition accounting rules, including the extent to which sales transactions in a given period are unrecognizable until a future period or, conversely, the satisfaction of revenue recognition rules in a given period resulting in the recognition of revenue from transactions initiated in prior periods;\n\u2022\nthe sale of our products in the timeframes we anticipate, including the number and size of orders, and the product mix within any such orders, in each quarter;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and ship in a timely manner new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements;\n\u2022\nthe timing and execution of product transitions or new product introductions, including any related or resulting inventory costs;\n\u2022\ndelays in customer purchasing cycles in response to our introduction of new products or product transitions;\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of new product introductions. For example, we continue to introduce new access points based on 802.11ac technology, including the wall plate access point in November 2014. These new products may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance or be accepted into our sales channel by our channel partners. Furthermore, many of our target customers might have recently\npurchased our 802.11n access points and are not ready to further invest in the newer 802.11ac technology. In addition, these target customers might not have previously purchased products based on 802.11ac technology and might not have a specific budget for the purchase of these products;\n\u2022\nunpredictability in the development of core, new or adjacent markets, including the cloud networking market with respect to our new XPress Cloud product;\n\u2022\nthe timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our sales strategy focusing primarily on customers in our key verticals of education, hospitality, healthcare and enterprise;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including new entrants or substantial discounting of products;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the components we purchase;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with channel partners, and the effectiveness of any changes we make to our distribution model;\n\u2022\nany increase or decrease in operating expenses in response to changes in the marketplace or perceived marketplace opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe quality and level of our execution of our business strategy and operating plan;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, including our ability to provide attractive incentives to our channel partners and customers through our pricing and discount programs; and,\n\u2022\nour ability to derive anticipated benefits from our investments in sales, marketing, engineering or other activities\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, and could continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, including net losses of $20.9 million, $12.4 million and $31.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $286.3 million. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs and sales and marketing programs. We expect to incur operating losses in the future, including through fiscal year 2015, as a result of the expenses associated with the continued development and expansion of our business. In January 2015, we announced cost and expense reductions and we reduced the approximate range of quarterly revenues necessary to reach operating break-even. However, we will continue to incur operating losses if we do not achieve such quarterly revenues. If we continue to incur operating losses, we may be required to further restructure the business in the future, including further cost and expense reductions. Additionally, we may also be affected by the timing of litigation defense costs. Our ability to attain profitability in the future will be affected by, among other things, our ability to execute our business strategy, the continued acceptance of our products, the timing and size of orders, the average selling prices of our products, the costs of our products, and the level of investment in sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative resources. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase that profitability. As a result, our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline.\nThe announcement of our engagement of Deutsche Bank as our financial advisor to explore strategic options could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur announcement that we have retained Deutsche Bank as our exclusive financial advisor to explore strategic options, including, but not limited to, strategic partnering of our technology and possible sale or merger of Meru, could disrupt our business and create uncertainty about our prospects as a stand-alone entity. This could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of whether a strategic transaction is completed. These risks to our business include:\n\u2022\ndiversion of significant management time and resources towards the investigation or completion of a strategic transaction;\n\u2022\ndifficulties developing and maintaining relationships with customers and other business partners; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of our ability to attract and retain key personnel and other employees.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance whether or when any strategic transaction will be undertaken or thereafter consummated, and, even if a transaction is consummated, there can be no assurance as to whether or to what degree such a transaction will be successful in maximizing value to our stockholders.\nFluctuations in our revenues and operating results could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur revenues and operating results are difficult to predict, even in the near term. Our historical operating results have in the past fluctuated significantly, and may continue to fluctuate in the future, as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our revenues and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. We may not be able to accurately predict our future revenues or results of operations. We base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are relatively fixed in the short-term. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues, and even a small shortfall in revenues could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter. It is possible that our operating results in some periods may be below expectations. This would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline. For example, in January 2015 we preannounced results for fourth quarter revenues that were lower than originally forecast and also announced a restructuring to reduce our operating break-even revenues. Following such preannouncement, the market price of our stock declined nearly 21% the following trading day. If we do not achieve future quarterly revenues in the revenue range for operating break-even, we will continue to incur operating losses which will continue to decrease our cash and our business may be harmed. If we continue to incur operating losses, we may be required to further restructure the business, including further cost and expense reductions. In addition to the other risk factors listed in this section, our operating results are affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour sales volume;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our products and services, including seasonal variations;\n\u2022\naverage selling prices and the potential for increased discounting of products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition in any given period as a result of revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand and manage lead times for the manufacturing of our products;\n\u2022\nshortages in the availability of components used in our products, including components whose manufacturing lead times have increased significantly or may increase in the future;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the components we purchase;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and maintain relationships with our channel partners and to increase their sales;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including new entrants, or further consolidation;\n\u2022\nreductions in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment for the certification and sale of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in funding for customer technology purchases in our markets, such as policy changes in public funding of educational institutions in the United States in accordance with the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s E-Rate program;\n\u2022\nclaims of intellectual property infringement against us and any resulting temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from selling our products or the requirement to pay settlements, damages or expenses associated with any such claims, together with the costs incurred in defending such claims;\n\u2022\nother claims made against us and the requirement to pay settlements, damages or expenses associated with any such claims, together with the costs incurred in defending such claims; and,\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in our domestic and international markets.\nFurther, as a result of customer buying patterns, historically we have received a substantial portion of a quarter\u2019s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of a quarter\u2019s revenues during the last two weeks of the quarter. If expected revenues at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize, our inability to deliver products prior to quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter, our failure to properly manage inventory to meet demand, or our inability to release new products on schedule, our revenues for that quarter could be materially and adversely affected and could fall below market expectations. For example, near the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, some of our key customers delayed purchases of our products that were originally forecast for that quarter. As a result, our revenues were lower than originally forecast. Following our January 2015 preannouncement of our revenues, the market price of our stock declined nearly 21% the following trading day.\nAs a result of the above factors, or other factors, our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In that event, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and if we require additional funds in the future, such funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2014 was $14.9 million. While as a result of expense reductions commenced in January 2015 we have reduced the range of quarterly revenues to reach operating break- even, we will continue to incur operating losses if we do not achieve quarterly revenues in that reduced revenue range. Operating losses will continue to decrease our cash and we may have to delay product development efforts and/or our customers may be hesitant to continue to do business with us, in which case our business would be harmed. We may need to raise substantial additional capital due to changes in business conditions or other future developments or in order to:\n\u2022\nexpand the commercialization of our products;\n\u2022\nfund our operations;\n\u2022\ncontinue our research and development;\n\u2022\ndefend, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or violate other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ndevelop and commercialize new products;\n\u2022\nservice our debt obligations and avoid any restrictions on our operations that may result from a failure to do so; and,\n\u2022\nacquire companies and in-licensed products or intellectual property.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nsuccessful implementation of, and achieving benefits from, our marketing and sales activities;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which the markets for our products develop;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications;\n\u2022\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing additional technical support capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and,\n\u2022\nthe market for such funding requirements and overall economic conditions.\nWe may require additional funds in the future and we may not be able to obtain such funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, as we did in March 2013, our stockholders would experience dilution. The holders of new equity securities may also receive rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt or additional equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders, including the issuance of warrants which would cause further overhang for potential shares outstanding. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we would be required to modify our growth and operating plans to the extent of available funding, which would harm our ability to grow our business. In addition, we believe that the maintenance of cash balances at a level deemed adequate by our customers and potential customers is necessary to maintain and grow the level of our product sales. The unavailability of additional funding on acceptable terms could also result in our delaying development or commercialization of our products or licensing third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize in-house. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets (including our equity investment in a third party company), or delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our development programs. We also may have to reduce sales, marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations. Any of these factors could harm our operating results.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures from existing and new companies may harm our business and operating results.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are influenced by the following competitive factors:\n\u2022\nperformance, quality, reliability and predictability of the solution;\n\u2022\ninitial price and total cost of ownership;\n\u2022\ncomprehensiveness of the solution;\n\u2022\nability to provide quality customer service and support;\n\u2022\ninteroperability with other devices;\n\u2022\nscalability of the solution;\n\u2022\nability to provide secure mobile access to the network; and,\n\u2022\nability to bundle the solution with other networking offerings.\nCompetitors are likely to attempt to compete against us by raising with customers uncertainty regarding our business and prospects as a result of our announcement that we have retained Deutsche Bank as our exclusive financial advisor to explore strategic options, including, but not limited to, strategic partnering of our technology and possible sale or merger of Meru.\nOur primary competitors include Cisco Systems, Aruba Networks, Ruckus Wireless, Aerohive Networks, Motorola Solutions, Hewlett-Packard and Juniper Networks. We also face competition from a number of other companies, such as ADTRAN, AirTight Networks, Extreme Networks, Extricom, Ubiquiti Networks, and Xirrus. In addition, as we expand our business with our XPress Cloud offering, we expect to be competing with other companies who offer cloud-based networking products in addition to the competitors above. Some of these other companies include private and start-up companies, while companies such as Cisco Systems offers cloud-based products through its Meraki products. We have limited to no experience in offering cloud-based solutions. We expect competition to intensify in the future as other companies introduce new products into our markets. This competition could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase, or our loss of, market share, any of which could seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition. If we do not keep pace with product and technology advances, it could materially and adversely affect our competitive position, revenues and prospects for growth.\nA number of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we. As a result, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily, and more quickly develop and expand their product and service offerings. Our competitors with larger volumes of orders and more diverse product offerings may require our VARs and distributors to stop selling our products, or to reduce their efforts to sell our products, which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, more diverse product offerings and may be able to bundle wireless products with other networking offerings. Potential customers may prefer to purchase all of their equipment from a single provider, or may prefer to purchase wireless networking products from an existing supplier rather than a new supplier, regardless of product performance or features.\nWe expect increased as well as new competition as our markets continue to expand. Conditions in our markets, including the vertical markets that we serve, could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, funding constraints or other factors. We expanded our product portfolio in February 2015 to include XPress Cloud, a cloud offering targeted to the complementary small-and-medium enterprise and medium-and-large enterprise market. If we do not expand into different markets than the markets we serve, we may not be able to grow our business. While we monitor and research developments in unserved vertical markets, we may not be able to compete in those markets if we decide to expand our markets.\nIn addition, current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources, such as Cisco\u2019s acquisition of Meraki and Enterasys Networks\u2019 acquisition by Extreme Networks, as well as the currently contemplated acquisition of the Enterprise division of Motorola Solutions by Zebra\nTechnologies Corporation. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization to compete with us. Continued industry consolidation may adversely impact customers\u2019 perceptions of the viability of smaller and even medium-sized wireless networking companies and, consequently, customers\u2019 willingness to purchase from such companies.\nWe compete in a rapidly evolving market, and the failure to respond quickly and effectively to changing market requirements could cause our business and operating results to decline.\nThe wireless networking market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing customer needs, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services. In order to deliver a competitive WLAN, our virtualized WLAN solutions must be capable of operating with an ever increasing array of wireless devices and an increasingly complex network environment. In addition, our products are designed to be compatible with industry standards for communications over wireless networks. As new wireless devices are introduced and standards in the wireless networking market evolve, we may be required to modify our products and services to make them compatible with these new products and standards. Likewise, if our competitors introduce new products and services that compete with ours, we may be required to reposition our product and service offerings or introduce new products and services in response to such competitive pressure.\nFor example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, recently approved a new standard, IEEE 802.11ac. This major upgrade of IEEE 802.11 technologies is intended to enable very high throughput operation for stations in Wi-Fi networks. In July 2013, we announced our first 802.11ac solution. However, we may not be successful in modifying our current products or introducing new ones in a timely or appropriately responsive manner, or at all, for future technologies. If we fail to address these changes successfully, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nIn addition, in June 2014, we announced that we were the first wireless networking company to receive certification from the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) OpenFlow\u2122 Testing Conformance Program for our 802.11ac products. ONF members including us are collaborating with companies around the world to bring open networking solutions to market and are focused on software-defined networking solution development. While we are leading innovation in software-defined networking through our participation in ONF, this technology may not lead to meaningful revenue in the short term or the long term and any lack of success in this area may delay or prevent the achievement of other product development or business objectives and could harm our business.\nWhile our core large enterprise business continues to mature and growth rates in this market increasingly continue to decrease, we have expanded our addressable market to include small-and-medium enterprises. In February 2015, we launched XPress Cloud, a cloud offering targeted to these small-and-medium enterprises. In 2014, we also announced new software applications to complement our current products. We have limited experience in the small-and-medium enterprise market and our new products in this space may not meet customers\u2019 needs. We continue to evaluate and develop products and product features to address this new market. If we fail to successfully adapt our products to the requirements of this market segment, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to hire, integrate and retain qualified personnel, our business will suffer.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. All of our executive officers are at-will employees, and therefore may terminate employment with us at any time. The loss of the service of any member of our management team, or any other key employee, may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business. In January 2015, we announced a restructuring of our business, which included a reduction of headcount from 381 to approximately 350. This reduction of headcount included members of executive management and other key employees. Remaining employees may be uncertain about the prospects of our business and attrition from remaining employees, including key management employees, may increase. If we continue to lose the services of key employees, including in the near term, our business would be harmed.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel. Our inability to attract, integrate or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area and India where we have a substantial presence and need for highly-skilled personnel. Our CEO joined the Company in March 2012 and four senior members of our executive management team joined in the second and third quarters of 2013. If we are unable to successfully integrate, as well as retain, management (including senior management such as these recent hires), our business will be harmed. We also may not be successful in attracting qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs.\nOften, significant amounts of time and resources are required to train technical, sales and other personnel. Qualified individuals are in high demand. We have no assurance that our field sales personnel will become fully productive in the time periods anticipated. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain them, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational and managerial requirements, on a timely basis or at all, and we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. If we are unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business would suffer.\nFurther, fluctuations or a sustained decrease in the price of our stock could affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. When our stock price declines, our equity incentive awards may lose retention value, which may negatively affect our ability to attract and retain such personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. The loss of, or the inability to recruit, key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe must increase market awareness of our brand and our solution and develop and expand our sales channels, and if we are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe must improve the market awareness of our brand and solution and expand our relationships with our channel partners in order to increase our revenues. Further, we believe that we must continue to develop our relationships with new and existing channel partners to effectively and efficiently extend our geographic reach and market penetration. Our efforts to improve sales of our solution could materially increase our sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. If we are unable to significantly increase the awareness of our brand and solution, expand our relationships with channel partners, or effectively manage the costs associated with these efforts, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop new products and enhancements to our WLAN solution, we may not be able to remain competitive.\nWe must develop new products and continue to enhance our WLAN solution to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements. If we fail to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products, our business could be adversely affected, especially if our competitors are able to introduce products with enhanced functionality. In addition, as new mobile applications are introduced, our success may depend on our ability to provide a solution that supports these applications.\nFor instance, in response to declining growth rates in our core large enterprise business, we expanded our addressable market to include small-and-medium enterprises. In February 2015, we launched XPress Cloud, a cloud offering targeted to these small-and-medium enterprises. In 2014, we also announced new software applications to complement our current products. If we fail to successfully adapt our products to the requirements of this market segment, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe are subject to a number of industry standards established by various standards bodies, such as the IEEE, and we design our products to comply with these standards. As new industry standards emerge, we could be required to invest a substantial amount of resources to develop new products that comply with these standards. For example, we devoted a substantial amount of our research and development resources to design a virtualized WLAN solution that could optimize the performance allowed by the 802.11n standard. In addition, the IEEE recently approved a new standard, IEEE 802.11ac. This major upgrade of IEEE 802.11 technologies is intended to enable very high throughput operation for stations in Wi-Fi networks. In July 2013, we announced our first 802.11ac solution. If our products do not comply with new or changing standards that are ratified by the IEEE or other standards bodies, our ability to sell our products may be adversely affected and we may not realize the benefits of our research and development efforts. In addition, in June 2014 we announced that we were the first wireless networking company to receive certification from the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) OpenFlow\u2122 Testing Conformance Program for our 802.11ac products. This technology may not lead to meaningful revenue in the short term or the long term and any lack of success in this area may delay or prevent the achievement of other product development or business objectives and could harm our business.\nOur research and development efforts relating to new products and technologies are time-consuming, costly and complex. In January 2015, we announced a restructuring of the business, including a reduction of workforce headcount which affected our research and development team. With our reduced resources in research and development, we may not be able to develop new products for our markets. Even if we do expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, our efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products that are competitive in the marketplace, and this could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur WLAN solution incorporates complex technology and may contain defects or errors, which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nOur WLAN solution incorporates complex technology and must operate with a significant number and types of wireless devices running new and complex applications in a variety of environments utilizing different wireless communication industry standards. Our products have contained and may in the future contain defects or errors. In many cases, these defects or errors have delayed the introduction of new products or software updates. Some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers. These issues are most prevalent when new products or new updates or upgrades are introduced. As use cases for our products continue to evolve with an increasing number of devices and applications, such as video streaming, connecting to our wireless networks, our solution may experience increased number of software defects or bugs, as well as increased network instability. Any errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, damage to our brand and reputation, diversion of engineering resources, and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty, including claims relating to changes to our products made by our channel partners. Our contracts with customers generally contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of us and our products.\nAlthough certain technical problems experienced by users may not be caused by our WLAN solution, our business and reputation may be harmed if users perceive our solution as the cause of a slow or unreliable network connection.\nOur solution has been deployed in many different environments and is capable of providing wireless access to many different types of wireless devices operating a variety of applications. The ability of our WLAN solution to operate effectively can be negatively impacted by many different elements unrelated to our products. For\nexample, a user\u2019s experience may suffer from an incorrect setting in a wireless device, which is not a problem caused by the network. Even though certain technical problems experienced by users may not be caused by our solution, users often perceive the underlying cause to be the poor performance of the wireless network. This perception, even if incorrect, could harm our business and reputation.\nOur ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings, and our failure to offer high-quality support and services could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOnce our products are deployed within our customers\u2019 networks, our customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to assist in deploying and managing our products and to resolve any issues relating to our products. High-quality support is critical for the continued successful marketing and sale of our products. If we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing customers and could harm our reputation with potential customers. In addition, our support organization faces additional international challenges including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. Our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain high-quality support and services could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe expect our gross margin to vary over time, and our level of gross margin may not be sustainable.\nOur level of gross margin may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nincreased price competition;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer or product and service mix;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products;\n\u2022\nour ability to reduce production costs;\n\u2022\nincreases in material or labor costs;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of licensing third party technologies that are used in our products;\n\u2022\nexcess inventory, inventory holding charges and obsolescence charges;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;\n\u2022\nchanges in our distribution channels or with our channel sales partners;\n\u2022\nincreased warranty costs, including providing additional products at very low or no cost to our customers to resolve product performance issues; and,\n\u2022\ninbound shipping charges.\nAs a result of any of these factors, or other factors, our gross margin may be adversely affected, which in turn would harm our operating results.\nOur revenues may decline as a result of changes in public funding of educational institutions.\nWe have historically generated a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to educational institutions. Public schools in the United States generally receive funding from local and state tax and bond revenue, and from federal governments through a variety of programs, many of which seek to assist schools located in underprivileged or rural areas. We believe that the funding for a substantial portion of our sales to educational\ninstitutions comes from federal funding, in particular the E-Rate program. E-Rate is a program of the Federal Communications Commission that subsidizes the purchase of approved telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connections costs for eligible public educational institutions. In the event that the federal government reduces the amounts dedicated to the E-Rate program in future periods, or eliminates the program completely, our sales to educational institutions may be reduced. As of July 2014, after effectively halting E-Rate program funding in February 2014, the Federal Communications Commission announced that it would fund the next two years of E-Rate for internal connections at approximately $1 billion per year. We currently expect federal E-Rate funds disbursements to schools to recommence starting in July 2015. We continue to monitor the developments in E-Rate, but there can be no assurance that this program or its equivalent will continue, and as a result, our business may be harmed. Furthermore, if state or local funding of public education is significantly reduced because of legislative or policy changes or by reductions in tax revenues due to changing economic conditions, our sales to educational institutions may be negatively impacted by these changed conditions. Any reduction in spending on information technology systems by educational institutions would likely materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers outside the U.S. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 52%, 45% and 48% of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the U.S. While our international sales have typically been denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country, leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country.\nIn addition, we have a research and development facility located in India, and we expect to expand our offshore development efforts and general and administrative functions within India and possibly in other countries. We also have sales and support personnel in numerous countries worldwide.\nOur international operations subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of managing and staffing international offices and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, against which we currently do not hedge;\n\u2022\nheightened exposure to political and economic instability, war and terrorism;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\ncosts of compliance with, and the risks and costs of non-compliance with, differing and changing regulatory and legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, and irregularities in, financial statements;\n\u2022\nmultiple conflicting tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe need to localize our products for international customers; and,\n\u2022\nincreased cost of managing employees in foreign countries, including increased costs of terminating employees in certain jurisdictions.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAnother significant risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations, such as the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act of 2010. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented training and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other channel partners, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nOur product and service sales and our international operations may be subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country and change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. Further, in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. Although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, litigation, fines, penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur use of and reliance on research and development resources in India may expose us to unanticipated costs or events.\nWe have a significant research and development center in Bangalore, India and, in recent years, have increased headcount and development activity at this facility. There is no assurance that our reliance upon research and development resources in India will enable us to achieve meaningful cost reductions or greater resource efficiency. Further, our research and development efforts and other operations in India involve significant risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty hiring and retaining appropriate engineering personnel due to intense competition for such resources and resulting wage inflation;\n\u2022\nthe knowledge transfer related to our technology and resulting exposure to misappropriation of intellectual property or information that is proprietary to us, our customers and other third parties;\n\u2022\nheightened exposure to change in the economic, security and political conditions in India;\n\u2022\ndifferences in cultural expectations regarding various functions and policies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and regulatory compliance in India; and,\n\u2022\ninterruptions to our operations in India as a result of floods and other natural catastrophic events as well as manmade problems such as power disruptions or terrorism.\nDifficulties resulting from the factors above and other risks related to our operations in India could expose us to increased expense, impair our development efforts and harm our competitive position.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market. From time to time, new accounting pronouncements and guidance are issued. For example, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission published an updated Internal Control-Integrated Framework and related illustrative documents in May 2013. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place a significant burden on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, and our degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate. While we have conducted employee training and implemented various controls and procedures, weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports filed with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources and provide significant management oversight and employee training, all of which may involve substantial accounting-related costs. Any failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to continue to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The NASDAQ Global Market.\nWhile we continue to evaluate disaster and business continuity risks, we have not yet implemented a complete disaster recovery plan or business continuity plan for our accounting and related information technology systems. Any disaster could therefore materially impair our ability to maintain timely accounting and reporting.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our internal operations or information technology or networking services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nA significant portion of our business operations is conducted through use of our computer network. Maintaining the security of our computer information systems and communication systems is a critical issue for us and our customers. Although we have implemented security systems and procedures to protect the confidential\ninformation stored on these computer systems, experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of our customers or other third parties. As well, they may be able to create system disruptions, shutdowns or effect denial of service attacks, including a data protection breach or cyber-attack. We have been the subject of a denial of service attack in the past, although it did not materially affect our operations. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our networks or client computers, or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, or that misappropriate and distribute confidential information stored on these computer systems. It is also possible that computer programmers and hackers could penetrate the network security of customers using our solutions. If our computer systems and servers go down at the end of a fiscal quarter, our ability to recognize revenue may be delayed until we are able to utilize back-up systems and continue to process and ship our orders. This could cause our stock price to decline significantly. Moreover, potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. Any of the foregoing could further result in damage to customer confidence in our products and services, and could require us to incur significant costs to eliminate or alleviate the problem. Additionally, our ability to transact business may be affected. Such damage, expenditures and business interruption could seriously impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2015, we launched Meru XPress Cloud, our cloud wireless networking service targeted to the small-and-medium enterprise market. As we seek to expand our business with cloud service offerings, these cloud services may be compromised by hackers, or if customer confidential information is accessed without authorization, our business will be harmed. While we believe we have taken prudent measures with respect to customer data and data security, operating an online cloud service is a new business for us and we may not have the expertise to properly manage risks related to data security and systems security. If we are unable to successfully prevent breaches of security relating to our cloud service offerings or customer private information, including customer personal identification information, management would need to spend increasing amounts of time and effort in this area, and our business would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We protect our proprietary information and technology through licensing agreements, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries. These protections may not be available in all cases or may be inadequate to prevent our competitors from copying, reverse engineering or otherwise obtaining and using our technology, proprietary rights or products. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. For example, the laws of India, where we conduct significant research and development activities, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. In addition, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, or applications for any of the foregoing. Our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent, or superior, to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. In each case, our ability to compete could be significantly impaired.\nTo prevent substantial unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights against third parties. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management\u2019s attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we.\nAccordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe have a limited patent and trademark portfolio. To date, we have not applied for patent or trademark protection outside of the U.S. In 2014, we filed 19 patent applications in the U.S., compared to 6 in the prior year. While we plan to continue to protect our intellectual property with, among other things, patent protection, there can be no assurance that:\n\u2022\ncurrent or future U.S. or future foreign patent applications will be approved;\n\u2022\nour issued patents will protect our intellectual property and will not be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged by third parties;\n\u2022\nwe will succeed in protecting our technology adequately in all key jurisdictions in which we or our competitors operate;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business; or,\n\u2022\nothers will not independently develop similar or competing products or methods or design around any patents that may be issued to us.\nThe failure to obtain patents with claims of a scope necessary to cover our technology, or the invalidation or our patents, or our inability to protect any of our intellectual property, may weaken our competitive position and may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf market demand for wireless networks does not continue to develop as we anticipate, demand for our WLAN solution may not grow as we expect.\nThe success of our business depends on enterprises continuing to adopt wireless networks for use with their business-critical applications. The market for enterprise-wide wireless networks has only developed in recent years as enterprises have deployed wireless networks to take advantage of the convenient access to the network that they provide. As businesses seek to run their business-critical applications on these wireless networks, they recognize the limitations of other wireless solutions and the need for our virtualized WLAN solution. Ultimately, however, enterprises may elect not to deploy wireless networks and may elect not to run their business-critical applications on a wireless network. Accordingly, demand for our solution may not continue to develop as we anticipate, or at all.\nWhile our core large enterprise business continues to mature and growth rates in this market continue to decrease, we have expanded our addressable market to include small-and-medium enterprises with the launch of XPress Cloud, an offering targeted to the small-and-medium enterprise market. In 2014, we also announced new software applications to complement our current products. If we fail to successfully adapt our products to the requirements of this complementary market segment, our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable. As a result, our sales are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nThe timing of our sales is difficult to predict. Our sales efforts involve educating our customers about the use and benefits of our WLAN solution, including the technical capabilities of our products and the potential cost savings achievable by organizations deploying our solution. Customers typically undertake a significant\nevaluation process, which frequently involves evaluating not only our products but also those of our competitors and can result in a lengthy sales cycle. We spend substantial time, effort and money in our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, purchases of our WLAN solution are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing and other delays. If sales expected from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe believe that our business is subject to significant seasonal factors that may typically cause the first quarter of our fiscal year to have relatively weaker products revenues than the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ncustomers with a December 31 fiscal year end may choose to spend remaining budgets before their year end resulting in a positive impact on our product revenues in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year;\n\u2022\nthe structure of our direct sales compensation program may provide additional financial incentives to our sales personnel for exceeding their annual goals; and,\n\u2022\nmany of our education customers have procurement and deployment cycles that can result in stronger order flow in our second fiscal quarter than in other quarters, subject to the availability of traditional funding sources, such as the E-Rate program in the United States.\nWe believe that our historical growth, variations in the amount of orders booked in a prior quarter but not shipped until a later quarter and other variations in the amount of deferred revenues may have overshadowed the nature or magnitude of seasonal or cyclical factors in the past. In addition, the timing of one or more large transactions may diminish the impact of seasonal factors in any particular quarterly period. Seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nOur business, operating results and growth rates may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic or market conditions.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for IT and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. Our current business and operating plan assumes that economic activity in general, and IT spending in particular, will at least remain at close to current levels. However, we cannot be assured of the future level of IT spending and any deterioration in the level of such spending could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and growth rates. The purchase of our products involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources, therefore, weak economic conditions, or a reduction in IT spending, even if economic conditions improve, would likely adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our products and services, and reduced unit sales. For example, we believe that past economic downturns in the U.S. and international markets, especially in 2008 and 2009, adversely affected our business during that time period as customers and potential customers reduced costs by reducing or delaying purchasing decisions. Any unfavorable economic or market conditions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe average sales prices of our products may decrease.\nThe average sales prices for our products may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, a change in our mix of products, anticipation of the introduction of new products or promotional programs. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we expect this competition to increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or may\nbundle them with other products. For example, some of our competitors who provide network switching equipment may offer a wireless overlay network at very low prices or on a bundled basis. Furthermore, average sales prices for our products have typically decreased over product life cycles. A decline in our average selling prices in excess of our expectations may harm our operating results.\nWe rely on channel partners to generate a substantial majority of our revenues. If our partners fail to perform, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nSales through our channel partners accounted for 97%, 96% and 94% of our total net revenues during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products, or we are unable to obtain and retain a sufficient number of high-quality channel partners, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur largest distributor customers have historically distributed a significant amount of our products worldwide. Resale of product through Westcon Group, Scansource Catalyst and SiraCom accounted for 52% of our worldwide net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014 . Resale of product through Westcon Group, Catalyst Telecom, SiraCom and Ingram Micro accounted for 72% and 68% of our worldwide net revenues in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nOur channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling and supporting our products and services. They may also market, sell and support our competitors\u2019 products and services, and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of those competitors\u2019 products. They may have incentives to promote our competitors\u2019 products in lieu of our products, particularly for our competitors with larger volumes of orders, more diverse product offerings and a longer relationship with our VARs or distributors. In these cases, our channel partners may stop selling our products completely. New sales channel partners may take several months or more to achieve significant sales. Our reliance on our channel partners could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresents the functionality of our products or services to customers, or violates applicable law or our corporate policies. If we fail to effectively manage our existing or future sales channel partners, our business would be seriously harmed.\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. Third parties, including some of our competitors, have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us or against our customers or channel partners for which we may be liable. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or require expensive changes to our products. As a result, these claims could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For example:\n\u2022\nWe previously received letters from, and had lengthy discussions with Motorola Solutions, one of our competitors with a large patent portfolio and substantial resources, concerning its allegations that our products infringe certain of its patents. Those negotiations ultimately resulted in us entering into a cross-license with Motorola Solutions in 2011 under which we paid Motorola Solutions a substantial settlement.\n\u2022\nIn May 2010, Extricom Ltd., filed suit against us in the Federal District Court of Delaware asserting infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,697,549. The litigation was dismissed after the parties entered into a settlement, license and release agreement in April 2012, in which we agreed to a one-time payment of approximately $2.4 million to Extricom Ltd., and we and Extricom Ltd. each agreed to a cross-license of each other\u2019s patents in exchange for a full release and settlement of the litigation.\nIn addition, we are currently subject to the lawsuits involving patent infringement as set forth under Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although no assurance may be given, we believe that we are not presently a party to any litigation of which the outcome, if determined adversely, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial position. We record litigation accruals for legal matters which are both probable and estimable. For legal proceedings for which there is a reasonable possibility of loss (meaning those losses for which the likelihood is more than remote but less than probable), we have determined that we do not have material exposure, or we are unable to develop a range of reasonably possible losses.\nAs our business expands and the number of products and competitors in our markets increases and overlaps occur, we expect that infringement claims may increase in number and significance. Intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against intellectual property claims. In addition, because we currently have a limited portfolio of issued patents compared to our major competitors, we may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues and against whom our potential patents may provide little or no deterrence. Many of these potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. A successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services. We may also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property. Any such license may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.\nIn addition, much of our business relies on, and many of our products incorporate, proprietary technologies of third parties, including third party commercial software and open source software. We may not be able to obtain, or continue to obtain, licenses from such third parties on reasonable terms, and such licensing may increase our exposure to claims of infringement by other third parties.\nOur strategy to invest in sales and marketing programs and personnel may not generate the revenue increases anticipated or such revenue increases may only be realized over a longer period than currently expected.\nWe invest in sales and marketing programs and personnel based on the revenue that we anticipate they will generate, but our expectations may not be met in a timely fashion or at all. For example, we have in the past substantially expanded our field sales organization to provide improved coverage of the growing number of business opportunities in our target markets, and approximately doubled our sales headcount in connection with the expansion. In addition, we have in the past made a variety of investments in marketing programs to complement the expansion of our field sales headcount. However, our revenue grew more slowly than we had anticipated as a result of that expansion of our sales organization, so we subsequently took steps to reduce our sales and marketing expenses to be more in line with our revenue expectations.\nMarket awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in the markets in which we compete and intend to compete. If our marketing programs are not successful in creating market awareness of our company and products and the value and need for our products or if the timing and degree of increased revenues resulting from our increased sales and marketing efforts does not meet our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer materially, and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth.\nWe base our inventory purchase decisions on our forecasts of customers\u2019 demand and, if our forecasts are inaccurate, our operating results could be materially harmed.\nWe place orders with our ODMs or manufacturers based on our forecasts of our customers\u2019 demand for our products. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, any of which may introduce errors into our estimates and affect our ability to service our customers. When demand for our products exceeds our forecast, we may not be able to meet demand for our products on a timely basis, and we may need to expend a significant amount of time working with our customers to allocate limited supply and maintain positive customer relations, or we may incur additional costs in order to expedite the manufacture and delivery of additional products. If we underestimate customer demand, our manufacturers may have inadequate materials and components required to produce our products and as a result, we may forego revenue opportunities, lose market share and damage our customer relationships. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, our manufacturers may assess charges and we may purchase more finished goods inventory than we are able to sell when we expect to or at all. As a result, we could have excess or obsolete inventory, resulting in a decline in the value of our inventory, which would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our liquidity and which could negatively affect our gross margins. Our failure to accurately manage inventory against demand would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and depend on them for the supply and quality of our products.\nWe utilize ODMs to manufacture our products, and are subject to the risk that those manufacturers will not manufacture products with the quality and performance that our customers expect from our products. Our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by our manufacturers from their customers. As a result, fulfilling our orders may not be a priority in the event our manufacturers are constrained in their ability to fulfill all of their customer obligations in a timely manner. Quality or performance failures of our products or changes in our manufacturers\u2019 financial or business condition could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results. Moreover, an increasing portion of our manufacturing is performed outside the United States, primarily in China and Taiwan, and is, therefore, subject to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. This includes risks resulting from the perception that certain jurisdictions, including China, do not comply with internationally recognized rights of freedom of expression and privacy and may permit labor practices that are deemed unacceptable under evolving standards of social responsibility. If manufacturing or logistics in these foreign countries is disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, information technology system failures, military or government actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, or if the purchase or sale of products from such foreign countries is prohibited or disfavored our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of the components and technologies used in our products are purchased and licensed from a single source or a limited number of sources. The loss of any of these suppliers may cause us to incur additional transition costs, result in delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products, or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory and could cause us to redesign our products.\nWhile supplies of our components are generally available from a variety of sources, we currently depend on a single source or limited number of sources for several components used in our products. For example, the chipsets that we use in our products are currently available only from a limited number of sources, with whom neither we nor our manufacturers have entered into supply agreements. For example, a substantial portion of our access points and controllers incorporate chipsets from Broadcom. We do not have any supply agreement with Broadcom and if Broadcom is unable to deliver the products that we or our manufacturers order from them, we may not be able to ship our access points to our customers and our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have also entered into license agreements with some of our suppliers for technologies that are used in our products, and the termination of these licenses, which can generally be done on relatively short notice, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business. In the event one of our license agreements with a supplier is terminated, we may be required to redesign some of our products in order to incorporate technology from alternative sources. The resulting redesign could require procuring additional licenses and incurring additional development costs, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs there may be no other sources for these components and technologies, the loss of any of these suppliers would require that we transition to a new component or technology, which could increase our costs, result in delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products or cause us to carry excess or obsolete inventory, and we could be required to redesign our hardware and software in order to incorporate components or technologies from alternative sources.\nIn addition, for certain components for which there are multiple sources, we are still subject to potential price increases and limited availability due to market demand for such components. In the past, unexpected demand for communication products caused worldwide shortages of certain electronic parts. If such shortages occur in the future, our business would be adversely affected. We carry very little inventory of our products, and we and our manufacturers rely on our suppliers to deliver necessary components in a timely manner. We and our manufacturers rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with these suppliers, and as a result, even if available, we or our manufacturers may not be able to secure sufficient components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products in a timely manner and, therefore, may not be able to meet customer demands for our products, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on two third parties for the fulfillment of our customer orders, and the failure of these third parties to perform could have an adverse effect upon our reputation and our ability to distribute our products, which could cause a material reduction in our revenues.\nWe use two third party logistics providers to hold our inventory and fulfill our customer orders. If these third-party logistics providers fail to perform, our ability to deliver our products and to generate revenues would be adversely affected. The failure of our third-party logistics providers to deliver products in a timely manner could lead to the dissatisfaction of our channel partners and customers and damage our reputation, which may cause our channel partners or customers to cancel existing agreements with us and to stop doing business with us. In addition, this reliance on third-party logistics providers also may impact the timing of our revenue recognition if our logistics providers fail to deliver orders during the prescribed time period. Although we believe that alternative logistics providers are readily available in the market, in the event we are unexpectedly forced to change providers we could experience short-term disruptions in our delivery and fulfillment process that could adversely affect our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur products contain software modules licensed for use from third-party authors under open source licenses, including the GNU Public License, the GNU Lesser Public License, the Apache License and others. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use and the manner in which we use it. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of those open source licenses, be required to release the source code of that proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be\nrequired to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event a license could not be obtained or re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely and cost-effective basis, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below our expectations and/or expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management estimates include implicit service periods for revenue recognition, litigation and settlement costs, other loss contingencies, sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, reserve for warranty costs, valuation of deferred tax assets, loss contingency estimates, fair value of common stock, stock-based compensation expense, fair value of warrants and fair value of earn-out consideration.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, or if we are required to make revisions to our financial statements as a result of periodic regulatory review, which could cause our operating results to fall below market expectations, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nOur products incorporate encryption technology and are subject to United States export controls, and may be exported outside the U.S. only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations.\nIn addition, we have implemented limited procedures to ensure our compliance with export regulations, and if our export compliance procedures are not effective, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could lead to a material fine or sanction that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not appropriately manage any future growth, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our operating results could be negatively affected.\nOur future growth, if it occurs, could place significant demands on our management, infrastructure and other resources. We may need to increasingly rely on IT systems, some of which we do not currently have significant experience in operating, to help manage critical functions. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure and our operating and administrative systems and controls, and we must continue to manage headcount, capital and processes in an\nefficient manner. We may not be able to successfully implement improvements to our infrastructure, systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner, which could result in additional operating inefficiencies and could cause unanticipated increases in our costs. If we do increase our operating expenses in anticipation of the growth of our business and this growth does not meet our expectations, our financial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud. Our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenues, expenses and earnings, or to prevent certain losses. Any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination within our organization. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our VARs, distributors and customers, which could result in material losses and negatively impact our operating results.\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of net 30 days in the U.S. and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the U.S. If any of our VARs, distributors or customers becomes insolvent or suffers a deterioration in its financial or business condition and is unable to pay for our products, our results of operations could be harmed. As we seek to expand our business into the small-and-medium enterprise and medium-and-large enterprise markets, we may take orders directly from end user customers. As such, we would have to expand our systems and processes to accommodate this direct business. We have limited history in these markets and if we are unable to adapt our business processes to confirm creditworthiness of our end user customers, our business could be harmed.\nWe invest in companies for both strategic and financial reasons, but may not realize a return on our investments in every instance.\nWe have made, and may continue to seek to make, investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. These investments may include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies, and may be non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. We do not restrict the types of companies in which we seek to invest. These companies may range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. If any company in which we invest fails, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity or debt investment in a public or private company in which we have invested, we will have to write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. The performance of any of these investments could result in significant impairment charges and gains (losses) on other equity investments. We must also analyze accounting and legal issues when making these investments. If we do not structure these investments properly, we may be subject to certain adverse accounting issues, such as potential consolidation of financial results.\nFurthermore, if the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives, we may seek to dispose of the investment. Our non-marketable equity investments in private companies are not liquid, and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our results. Gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities and impairment charges related to debt instruments as well as equity and other investments.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Any difficulties in the implementation of these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory or administrative discipline, including the possibility of a restatement of our financial statements, or litigation.\nNew regulations or changes in existing regulations related to our products may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and future sales, and could place additional burdens on the operations of our business.\nOur products are subject to governmental regulations in a variety of jurisdictions. If any of our products becomes subject to new regulations or if any of our products becomes specifically regulated by additional government entities, compliance with such regulations could become more burdensome, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, radio emissions are subject to regulation in the U.S. and in other countries in which we do business. In the U.S., various federal agencies including the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various state agencies have promulgated regulations that concern the use of radio/electromagnetic emissions standards. Member countries of the European Union have enacted similar standards concerning electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility and emissions standards, as well as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or WEEE, and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electric Equipment, or RoHS, regulations with which our products and operations in the European Union must comply. We are further required to evaluate compliance with various laws and regulations that may be applicable to our business, such as the conflict minerals disclosure rules promulgated by the SEC in August 2012. The rule requires investigation and disclosure of the use of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in our products. These rules apply to our business, and we are expending resources to ensure compliance. We may face reputational challenges and the loss of sales if we are required to publicly state that we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the defined \u201cconflict\u201d metals used in our products. The failure to comply with these regulations could result in the assessment of fines or penalties or other relief against us.\nIn addition, our wireless communication products operate through the transmission of radio signals. Currently, operation of these products in specified frequency bands does not require licensing by regulatory authorities. Regulatory changes restricting the use of frequency bands or allocating available frequencies could become more burdensome and could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income is subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes and it is possible that the recent March 2013 secondary stock offering could result in an ownership change. In addition, if we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Our net operating losses may also be impaired under state law. As a consequence, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs. At December 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $163.8 million and $119.9 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2022 and 2015, respectively.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by the following:\n\u2022\nearnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpiration of, or lapses in, the research and development tax credit laws;\n\u2022\ntransfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement and legal structure;\n\u2022\ntax effects of nondeductible compensation;\n\u2022\ntax costs related to intercompany realignments;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; or,\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and regulations including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations may have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as power disruptions, network security breaches or terrorism.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. We also have significant research and development activities in India and facilities in Japan, regions known for typhoons, floods and other natural disasters. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, occurring at our headquarters, our other facilities or where our ODMs and channel partners are located, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce located worldwide, and in particular, our research and development activities that are coordinated between our corporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area and our facility in India. Any disruption to our internal communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by manmade problems, such as power disruptions or the penetration of our system by \u201chackers\u201d, could delay our research and development efforts and affect our internal operations. To the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, delay of our research and development efforts or the deployment of our products, or interrupt the orderly operation of our business, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe completed our first acquisition, that of Identity Networks, in 2011. In the future we may acquire other businesses, products or technologies. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, or such acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. We may also face additional challenges, because acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of acquired operations, technologies, personnel and/or products;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with the acquisition transaction;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the regular operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on new and existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering geographic or business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of products and services from either company; and,\n\u2022\ndelays in realizing or failure to realize the benefits of an acquisition.\nCompetition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, assets and product lines has been, and may in the future continue to be, intense. As such, even if we are able to identify an acquisition that we would like to consummate, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms or because the target is acquired by another company. Furthermore, in the event that we are able to identify and consummate any future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt;\n\u2022\nincur significant acquisition-related expenses;\n\u2022\nassume contingent liabilities; or,\n\u2022\nexpend significant cash.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile. Further, you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variation in anticipated results of operations of us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditional dilution to our existing shareholders due to new financing activities;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet the estimates or expectations of analysts or investors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole, such as the continuing volatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nany major change in our management;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and,\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research and industry analysts publish about us, our business and our products. We do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if an analyst issues other unfavorable commentary. Additionally, if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. Further, securities analysts may elect not to initiate research coverage of our common stock and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of shares underlying outstanding options, warrants and other rights to acquire our common stock could dilute our existing stockholders and cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 24.1 million shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding. At that date, we had outstanding options and other rights to acquire approximately 4.6 million shares of our common stock, including stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock and shares anticipated to be purchased under our ESPP at the next purchase date, to the extent such securities become vested and are exercised as permitted by the provisions of the plans and agreements applicable to those securities. The weighted-average exercise price for options was $4.81 per share as of December 31, 2014. In addition, on December 31, 2014, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.05 per share. If a substantial amount of these additional shares are issued and are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, our existing stockholders will suffer dilution of their percentage ownership of outstanding common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, and we have contractual restrictions against paying cash dividends that are contained in our loan agreements. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. The provisions in our certificate or incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nallowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and,\n\u2022\nsupermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or even a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests by preventing or discouraging attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. We are also subject to Delaware laws that could discourage hostile takeover attempts. One of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met.", "PERMNO": 93307, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "MERU"}
